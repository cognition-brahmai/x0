Remember that the first three letters represent the first three digits of the number, the next three letters represent the second three digits, and so on. Please provide a formula to calculate the answer using the following code:\npackage main\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n)\nfunc main() {\n    minSum := 1000000 // smallest possible sum of squares for a 6-digit number\n    var minNum int\n    for a := 0; a < 10; a++ {\n        for b := 0; b < 10; b++ {\n            if b == a {\n                continue\n            }\n            for c := 0; c < 10; c++ {\n                if c == a || c == b {\n                    continue\n                }\n                for d := 0; d < 10; d++ {\n                    if d == a || d == b || d == c {\n                        continue\n                    }\n                    for e := 0; e < 10; e++ {\n                        if e == a || e == b || e == c || e == d {\n                            continue\n                        }\n                        for f := 0; f < 10; f++ {\n                            if f == a || f == b || f == c || f == d || f == e {\n                                continue\n                            }\n                            num1 := a*100 + d*10 + b\n                            num2 := e*100 + c*10 + f\n                            num3 := b*100 + f*10 + c\n                            sum := num1*num1 + num2*num2 + num3*num3\n                            if sum < minSum {\n                                minSum = sum\n                                minNum = a*100000 + b*10000 + c*1000 + d*100 + e*10 + f\n                            }\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    fmt.Printf(\"The smallest number is %d\", minNum)\n}"

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to iterate over all possible combinations of distinct digits (from 0 to 9) to form the six-digit number in the format ABCDEF. We then calculate three three-digit numbers based on the specified pattern: `num1 = ADB`, `num2 = ECF`, `num3 = BFC`. The goal is to find the smallest six-digit number such that the sum of the squares of these three numbers equals the value of the six-digit number itself.\n\nThe challenge lies in ensuring that the calculated sum of squares exactly matches the six-digit number formed by ABCDEF. Here's the code with the necessary logic:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    minSum := 1000000 // start with an illogically high minimum sum (no 6-digit number can be this sum)\n    var minNum int\n    for a := 0; a < 10; a++ {\n        for b := 0; b < 10; b++ {\n            if b == a {\n                continue\n            }\n            for c := 0; c < 10; c++ {\n                if c == a || c == b {\n                    continue\n                }\n                for d := 0; d < 10; d++ {\n                    if d == a || d == b || d == c {\n                        continue\n                    }\n                    for e := 0; e < 10; e++ {\n                        if e == a || e == b || e == c || e == d {\n                            continue\n                        }\n                        for f := 0; f < 10; f++ {\n                            if f == a || f == b || f == c || f == d || f == e {\n                                continue\n                            }\n                            num1 := a*100 + d*10 + b\n                            num2 := e*100 + c*10 + f\n                            num3 := b*100 + f*10 + c\n                            sum := num1*num1 + num2*num2 + num3*num3\n                            sixDigitNum := a*100000 + b*10000 + c*1000 + d*100 + e*10 + f\n                            if sum == sixDigitNum && sixDigitNum < minSum {\n                                minSum = sixDigitNum\n                                minNum = sixDigitNum\n                            }\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    fmt.Printf(\"The smallest number is %d\\n\", minNum)\n}\n```\n\nHere\u2019s the step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization:** We initialize `minSum` with a value greater than any possible six-digit number since we are looking for the smallest valid number.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Digits:** We use nested loops to generate all possible combinations of distinct digits for A, B, C, D, E, and F.\n\n3. **Form Three-Digit Numbers:** Calculate `num1`, `num2`, and `num3` using the given formulas.\n\n4. **Calculate Sum of Squares:** Compute the sum of the squares of these three-digit numbers.\n\n5. **Check Condition:** If the sum matches the six-digit number formed by ABCDEF and is smaller than any previously found, update `minSum` and `minNum`.\n\n6. **Output Result:** After checking all combinations, print the smallest number that satisfies the condition.\n\nThis code will efficiently find the smallest six-digit number that fulfills the given condition by checking each valid permutation of the digits."
