        "content": "To resolve the issue of having `pip` linked to Python 3.2 when you want it for Python 2.7, you'll need to ensure that the correct version of `pip` is installed specifically for Python 2.7. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to achieve that:\n\n1. **Ensure Python 2.7 is Installed:**\n   Verify that Python 2.7 is installed on your system by running:\n   ```bash\n   python2.7 --version\n   ```\n\n2. **Install pip for Python 2.7:**\n   You can use the `get-pip.py` script to install `pip` for Python 2.7. Here's how you can do it:\n\n   - First, download the `get-pip.py` script using `curl` or `wget`:\n     ```bash\n     curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/2.7/get-pip.py --output get-pip.py\n     ```\n     or\n     ```bash\n     wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/2.7/get-pip.py\n     ```\n\n   - Next, run the script with Python 2.7:\n     ```bash\n     python2.7 get-pip.py\n     ```\n\n3. **Verify the Installation:**\n   After installation, verify that `pip` is correctly linked to Python 2.7 by checking its version:\n   ```bash\n   python2.7 -m pip --version\n   ```\n\n4. **Using pip for Python 2.7:**\n   You can now use `pip` with Python 2.7 by explicitly calling it as follows:\n   ```bash\n   python2.7 -m pip install <package-name>\n   ```\n\n5. **Update Alternatives (Optional):**\n   If you want to make Python 2.7 the default version for `python` and `pip`, you can update the alternatives system (if applicable on your system):\n   ```bash\n   sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python2.7 1\n   sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/pip pip /usr/local/bin/pip2 1\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should have `pip` installed and working for Python 2.7, independent of any Python 3 versions that may also be installed on your system."
