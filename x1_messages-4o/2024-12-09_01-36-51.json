        "content": "In Python, I have a function definition that takes parameters. These parameters can be called in any order as long as they're named. However, as the functions in our codebase grow, people might be adding parameters between two parameters and it leads to the problem of wrong values being assigned to parameters that aren't named. In order to avoid this, I am looking for a way to force people to name certain parameters. This is not just about adopting a coding standard, but I am ideally looking for a flag or a PyDev plugin. For instance, in the following code, only the last function call should pass the check as all the parameters are named. Is implementing such a mechanism possible? Any suggestions on how to implement this would be appreciated.\n\n```python\ndef info(object, spacing=10, collapse=1)\n\n# Function calls\ninfo(odbchelper)                    \ninfo(odbchelper, 12)                \ninfo(odbchelper, collapse=0)        \ninfo(spacing=15, object=odbchelper)\n```"

        "content": "To enforce naming certain parameters in Python, you can leverage a few techniques that are built into the language itself, specifically using the keyword-only arguments feature. This feature allows you to specify that certain arguments must be provided as keyword arguments, preventing them from being passed positionally. However, note that this feature is available only in Python 3.\n\nHere's how you can modify your function to enforce naming of parameters:\n\n```python\ndef info(object, *, spacing=10, collapse=1):\n    # Function implementation here\n    print(f\"Object: {object}, Spacing: {spacing}, Collapse: {collapse}\")\n\n# Function calls\ninfo(odbchelper)                     # This will work\ninfo(odbchelper, 12)                 # This will raise a TypeError\ninfo(odbchelper, collapse=0)         # This will raise a TypeError\ninfo(spacing=15, object=odbchelper)  # This will work\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- The asterisk (`*`) in the function signature indicates that all parameters following it must be specified as keyword arguments. This means `spacing` and `collapse` cannot be given positionally anymore.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n1. **Coding Standards:** Even though Python doesn't have a built-in feature to enforce naming for arbitrary parameters, adopting a coding standard wherein all parameters are always named when called can be enforced through code reviews or static analysis tools.\n\n2. **Static Analysis Tools:** There are tools like `pylint` or `flake8` with custom plugins that can be configured to enforce the rule of naming arguments. While they might not provide this feature out of the box, you can create a custom plugin to check for this condition.\n\n3. **IDE Support:** Some IDEs, such as PyCharm, can provide warnings or suggestions when parameters are not named. Although this is more about providing guidance than enforcing rules, it can be helpful in maintaining consistency.\n\nBy using these techniques, you can help ensure that parameters are named appropriately, reducing the risk of errors caused by positional arguments."
