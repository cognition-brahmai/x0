The Lambda function is called, however, the CloudWatch logs indicate that my \"event\" object is None. The boto3 documentation suggests using the kwarg MessageStructure='json', but this results in a ClientError. How can I correctly publish a message to an SNS topic which can then notify a Lambda function and an SQS queue? Below is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport boto3\n\nmessage = {\"foo\": \"bar\"}\nclient = boto3.client('sns')\nresponse = client.publish(\n    TargetArn=arn,\n    Message=json.dumps(message)\n)\n```"

        "content": "To successfully publish a message to an SNS topic that notifies both a Lambda function and an SQS queue, ensuring that the Lambda function receives the correct event object, you should structure your message properly. If you're using the `MessageStructure='json'` parameter, you have to format the message as a JSON object with \"default\" and other protocol-specific keys.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport boto3\n\n# Define your message\nmessage = {\n    \"default\": json.dumps({\"foo\": \"bar\"}),\n    # Add other protocols here if needed, e.g., \"email\": \"Your email message\"\n}\n\n# Initialize the SNS client\nclient = boto3.client('sns')\n\n# Publish the message with MessageStructure='json'\ntry:\n    response = client.publish(\n        TargetArn=arn,\n        Message=json.dumps(message),\n        MessageStructure='json'\n    )\n    print(\"Message published successfully:\", response)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(\"Error publishing message:\", e)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **JSON Message Structure**: When using `MessageStructure='json'`, SNS expects the `Message` parameter to be a JSON object containing \"default\" and potentially other protocol-specific keys. The \"default\" key is used for all endpoints that do not have a protocol-specific message.\n\n2. **Lambda Event**: Make sure your Lambda function is correctly set up to receive events from the SNS topic. The event should not be `None` if the message is structured and sent correctly.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: Wrap your publish call in a try-except block to catch and handle any exceptions that might occur during the publish operation, such as `ClientError`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to publish a message that is correctly processed by both your Lambda function and any SQS queues subscribed to the SNS topic."
