        "content": "In Python, the `in` operator for string matching is implemented using the `PyUnicode_Find` function in CPython. This function is part of the Unicode object implementation and is responsible for searching for a substring within another string.\n\nThe `in` operator checks if the substring exists within the main string and returns `True` if it does, or `False` otherwise. Internally, this operation is typically implemented using a search algorithm such as the Boyer-Moore or a similar efficient substring search algorithm.\n\nRegarding the time complexity of the `in` operation for strings in CPython, it is generally O(n * m) in the worst case, where `n` is the length of the main string and `m` is the length of the substring. However, in practice, it can be faster due to optimizations in the search algorithm, especially when the substring is small or when early termination is possible.\n\nAs for the official documentation or wiki discussing this implementation, the CPython source code would be the primary resource. You can find the relevant implementation details in the CPython repository on GitHub, particularly in the `Objects/unicodeobject.c` file. This file contains the implementation of various string operations, including substring searches.\n\nWhile there might not be an explicit wiki or page dedicated solely to explaining the `in` operator for strings, the Python documentation provides general information about string operations and the behavior of sequence types. For a deeper dive, reviewing the CPython source code and comments within it would be beneficial for understanding the specific implementation details."
