The error message reads \"len(left_on) must equal the number of levels in the index of right\". My join statement is:\n```python\nmerged = DataFrameA.join(DataFrameB, on=['Code','Date'])\n```\nI'm unsure if column order matters, but for reference, DataFrameA and DataFrameB are structured as follows:\n```python\nDataFrameA:  Code, Date, ColA, ColB, ColC, ..., ColG, ColH (shape: 80514, 8 - no index)\nDataFrameB:  Date, Code, Col1, Col2, Col3, ..., Col15, Col16 (shape: 859, 16 - no index)\n```\nDo I need to correct my join statement or is there another, more optimal way to achieve the intersection (or inner join) of these two DataFrames?"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering suggests that there's a mismatch between how you're specifying the keys for the join and the structure of your DataFrames. When using the `.join()` method in Pandas, it expects one of the DataFrames to have a MultiIndex that matches the keys specified. However, in your case, neither DataFrame has a MultiIndex, which is why you're seeing this error.\n\nTo perform an inner join on two DataFrames using specific columns, you should use the `.merge()` method instead of `.join()`. The `.merge()` method is more versatile and explicitly designed for joining DataFrames on specified columns. Here's how you can modify your join statement:\n\n```python\nmerged = DataFrameA.merge(DataFrameB, on=['Code', 'Date'], how='inner')\n```\n\nThis statement will perform an inner join on the 'Code' and 'Date' columns across both DataFrames. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the arguments:\n\n- `on=['Code', 'Date']`: Specifies the columns on which to join the two DataFrames.\n- `how='inner'`: Specifies that the join should be an inner join, meaning only the rows with matching keys in both DataFrames will be included in the result.\n\nThis should resolve the error and produce the desired result of merging the two DataFrames based on the 'Code' and 'Date' columns."
