How can I use the Python map function to achieve this? For instance, I have a list as follows:\n\n```python\na = ['2011-12-22 46:31:11','2011-12-20 20:19:17', '2011-12-20 01:09:21']\n```\n\nI want to split the strings by space (using `split(\" \")`) and the end result should look like this:\n\n```python\n[['2011-12-22', '46:31:11'], ['2011-12-20', '20:19:17'], ['2011-12-20', '01:09:21']]\n```"

        "content": "Certainly! You can use Python's `map` function along with the `split` method to achieve this. The `map` function applies a specified function to each item of an iterable (like a list) and returns a map object (which is an iterator). You can then convert this map object to a list. Here's how you can do it with your list of strings:\n\n```python\na = ['2011-12-22 46:31:11', '2011-12-20 20:19:17', '2011-12-20 01:09:21']\n\n# Use map to apply the split function to each element in the list\nresult = list(map(lambda x: x.split(\" \"), a))\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, `result` will be:\n\n```python\n[['2011-12-22', '46:31:11'], ['2011-12-20', '20:19:17'], ['2011-12-20', '01:09:21']]\n```\n\nThis code uses a lambda function to split each string by a space. The `map` function applies this lambda function to each element of the list `a`, and `list()` converts the resulting map object into a list of lists."
