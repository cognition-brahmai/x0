Here\u2019s a simple method to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {'A': [1, 2, 3],\n        'B': [4, 5, 6],\n        'C': [7, 8, 9]}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Calculate the sum of each column\nsum_row = df.sum()\n\n# Append the sum as a new row with a specific index\ndf.loc['Sum'] = sum_row\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nIn this example, a new row with the index 'Sum' is added to the DataFrame, containing the sum of each column. Adjust the index value in `df.loc['Sum']` to whatever specific index you require for your context."
