I've tried using the following code:\n\n```python\npylab.xlabel('metres 10^1')\n```\n\nHowever, I don't want the '^' symbol to be included. So, I tried this code:\n\n```python\npylab.xlabel('metres 10$^{one}$')\n```\n\nThis works well for superscripting letters, but doesn't seem to function correctly for numbers. For example, when I tried:\n\n```python\npylab.xlabel('metres 10$^1$')\n```\n\nIt superscripts the letter 'N' instead of the number '1'. Can anyone help me superscript numbers in Python plots?"

        "content": "To superscript numbers in Python plots using Matplotlib, you can use LaTeX-style formatting. It seems like you encountered an issue in your attempt, possibly due to a syntax error or misunderstanding of how to properly use LaTeX syntax in Matplotlib.\n\nHere's how you can label your x-axis with a superscripted number:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Example plot\nplt.plot([1, 2, 3], [1, 4, 9])\n\n# Correct way to use LaTeX formatting for superscripting numbers\nplt.xlabel(r'metres 10$^1$')\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n1. **Raw Strings**: Notice the `r` before the string in `xlabel`. This indicates that the string is a raw string, which tells Python not to treat backslashes as escape characters. It's especially useful when using LaTeX-style formatting.\n   \n2. **LaTeX Syntax**: Use `$` signs to denote a LaTeX math expression. Inside the math mode, `^` is used for superscripts. So `10^1` within `$` signs will render `10` with a superscript `1`.\n\n3. **Ensure Matplotlib Can Render LaTeX**: In some configurations, you might need to ensure that your environment is set up to render LaTeX properly. However, for basic superscripting like this, it usually works out of the box.\n\nIf you continue to run into issues, ensure your Matplotlib installation is up to date, and try using a different backend if necessary."
