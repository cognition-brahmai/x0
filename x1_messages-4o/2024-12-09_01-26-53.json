I have a need where I want to add or update only a single package without altering the versions of the remaining packages. I've tried using both `pipenv update --selective-upgrade requests` and `pipenv update --keep-outdated requests`, but the versions of all packages are still updated during locking. How can I add or update a single package without updating the versions of the rest of the packages?"

        "content": "To update or add a single package without affecting the other packages in your `Pipfile`, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Update the Package**: Use the `pipenv install` command with the specific package name. This will update or add the package without affecting others. For example, to update the `requests` package, run:\n\n   ```bash\n   pipenv install requests\n   ```\n\n   This command updates `requests` to the latest version that satisfies the constraints in your `Pipfile.lock`, or it adds it if it\u2019s not present.\n\n2. **Pin a Specific Version** (if needed): If you want to pin a specific version of the package, you can specify it during installation:\n\n   ```bash\n   pipenv install requests==2.25.1\n   ```\n\n3. **Manual Edit** (if necessary): If the above does not meet your needs due to some constraints in your `Pipfile.lock` that force other updates, you might need to manually edit your `Pipfile.lock`. However, be cautious with this approach as it may lead to inconsistencies.\n\n4. **Use `--skip-lock` Option**: If you are sure about your changes and want to avoid locking during the installation, you can use:\n\n   ```bash\n   pipenv install requests --skip-lock\n   ```\n\n   Then, you can lock the dependencies manually later with:\n\n   ```bash\n   pipenv lock\n   ```\n\n5. **Ensure Compatibility**: Sometimes, a package update might require updates to other dependencies due to compatibility issues. Ensure that the specific package version you want to install is compatible with the versions of other packages in your environment.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to update or add a package without significantly altering the versions of other packages in your project."
