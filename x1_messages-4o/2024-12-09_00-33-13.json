        "content": "Is there a way to control which plot is on top of other plots in Matplotlib if one makes multiple plots on one axis? For instance, in my current plot, the green series is on top of the blue series, and both series are on top of the black dots which I made with a scatter plot. I want the black dots to be on top of both series. I have tried several ways but no matter where I put the scatter function, the lines are on top of the dots. Here is what I've tried so far:\n\n```python\nplt.plot(series1_x, series1_y)\nplt.plot(series2_x, series2_y)\nplt.scatter(series2_x, series2_y)\n```\n\nThen I tried:\n\n```python\nfig = plt.figure()\nax1 = fig.add_subplot(111)\nax1.plot(series1_x, series1_y)\n\nax2 = fig.add_subplot(111)\nax2.plot(series2_x, series2_y)\n\nax3 = fig.add_subplot(111)\nax3.scatter(series2_x, series2_y)\n```\n\nI am using Python 3.5 on Windows 10 for this example, but mostly Python 3.4 on Ubuntu. It's important for my readers to clearly see which dots are what color, hence the need for the dots to be on top."

        "content": "In Matplotlib, you can control the order in which plots are drawn using the `zorder` parameter. By default, plots are drawn in the order that they are called, but you can override this behavior by specifying `zorder` values. Higher `zorder` values correspond to plots being drawn on top of those with lower values.\n\nTo make sure the black dots are on top of the series, you can set a higher `zorder` for the scatter plot. Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# First set of series with default zorder\nplt.plot(series1_x, series1_y, label='Series 1', zorder=1)\n\n# Second set of series with default zorder\nplt.plot(series2_x, series2_y, label='Series 2', zorder=2)\n\n# Scatter plot with higher zorder so it appears on top\nplt.scatter(series2_x, series2_y, color='black', label='Points', zorder=3)\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this example, the `zorder` values are set such that the scatter plot (`zorder=3`) is on top of both line plots (`zorder=1` and `zorder=2`). You can adjust these `zorder` values as needed to control the layering of different plot elements. If you have more elements to add, make sure to assign appropriate `zorder` values to control their ordering."
