I am using it to build a simple linear model with the following code:\n\n```python\nfire = load_data()\nregr = linear_model.LinearRegression()\nscores = cross_validation.cross_val_score(regr, fire.data, fire.target, cv=10, scoring='r2')\nprint scores\n```\n\nThe output I am getting is:\n\n```python\n[  0.00000000e+00   0.00000000e+00  -8.27299054e+02  -5.80431382e+00\n  -1.04444147e-01  -1.19367785e+00  -1.24843536e+00  -3.39950443e-01\n   1.95018287e-02  -9.73940970e-02]\n```\n\nI am puzzled as to how this is possible. When I use the built-in diabetes data, the code works perfectly fine. However, for my data, it returns these seemingly absurd results. Have I made some mistake in my code or data processing?"

        "content": "The issue of obtaining R\u00b2 values less than -1 indicates that your model is performing poorly on some of the cross-validation folds compared to a simple baseline model that predicts the mean of the target variable. Let's address a few points that could potentially lead to such results:\n\n1. **Data Quality and Preprocessing**: \n    - Ensure that your data is preprocessed correctly. Check for missing values, outliers, or incorrect data types. These issues can negatively impact model performance.\n    - Standardize or normalize your features, especially if they are on different scales. This can help the linear regression model converge more effectively.\n\n2. **Model Complexity and Data Suitability**:\n    - Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable. If this assumption doesn't hold for your data, consider using a more complex model or performing feature engineering.\n    - Review feature selection and ensure that the features you're using are relevant and contribute to the prediction of the target variable.\n\n3. **Cross-validation Setup**:\n    - The folds generated in cross-validation might be highly imbalanced or not representative of the overall dataset. Inspect the distribution of your data across folds.\n    - Consider using different cross-validation strategies, such as `StratifiedKFold`, if your data has imbalanced classes or specific characteristics.\n\n4. **Outliers and Influential Points**:\n    - Outliers or influential data points can disproportionately affect the performance of a linear regression model. Check for such points and consider using robust regression techniques if needed.\n\n5. **Scoring Function**:\n    - Double-check the scoring function. It should correctly reflect your model's performance metric. In this case, you are correctly using R\u00b2, but ensure there are no errors in how the `cross_val_score` function is invoked.\n\nTo debug further, you can start by visualizing your data to understand its distribution and relationships. Additionally, try evaluating your model on a single train-test split to see if the issue persists and to gain more insight into specific folds that might be causing problems. If necessary, perform feature selection or transformation to improve the model's performance."
