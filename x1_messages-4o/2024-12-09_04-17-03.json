I tried reinstalling the imports individually, reinstalling requirements.txt, configuring VSCode Workspace with an extra path to my project folder, and updating my venv path settings in VSCode. However, none of these steps have resolved my imports issue, and my routes are still not working. My file structure is as follows:\n\n```\n- > .vscode\n- > client *(React front end)*\n- > data\n- > server *(Python/Flask back end)*\n    - > app\n    - > venv\n    - config.py\n    - README.md\n    - requirements.txt *(this contains the 3 unresolved, along with several that are resolving)*\n- .env\n- .flaskenv\n- .gitignore\n- requirements.txt\n```\nCan you provide any suggestions or solutions for this?"

        "content": "Certainly! Import issues in a Flask app, especially when using VS Code, can be tricky. Here are some steps and suggestions to help you resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Virtual Environment Activation**:\n   - Ensure that your virtual environment is activated before running your server. In the terminal, navigate to your `server` directory and activate the virtual environment:\n     ```\n     cd server\n     .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate\n     ```\n   - After activation, run your Flask app again.\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Interpreter in VS Code**:\n   - Open the Command Palette in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+P), and type `Python: Select Interpreter`.\n   - Make sure to select the interpreter from your virtual environment (`venv`).\n\n3. **Verify Installed Packages**:\n   - Run the following command in your activated virtual environment to list installed packages:\n     ```\n     pip list\n     ```\n   - Ensure that the packages you're trying to import are listed. If not, reinstall them using:\n     ```\n     pip install -r requirements.txt\n     ```\n\n4. **Check Package Names**:\n   - Double-check the package names in your `requirements.txt` file. Sometimes, the import name in Python might differ slightly from the package name.\n\n5. **Update PYTHONPATH**:\n   - You can add the server path to your PYTHONPATH in your `.env` file or `launch.json` in VS Code:\n     ```json\n     \"env\": {\n         \"PYTHONPATH\": \"${workspaceFolder}/server\"\n     }\n     ```\n\n6. **Review Import Statements**:\n   - Ensure your import statements match the directory structure. If you're trying to import from `app`, make sure your imports reflect the correct path, e.g., `from app.module_name import class_name`.\n\n7. **Check for __init__.py Files**:\n   - Make sure each directory you want to import from has an `__init__.py` file. This file can be empty but is necessary for Python to recognize the directory as a package.\n\n8. **Use Absolute Imports**:\n   - Prefer using absolute imports over relative ones to avoid confusion. This means specifying the full path of the module from the root of the package.\n\n9. **Linting and Syntax Check**:\n   - Use a linter like `flake8` to check for any syntax errors or unresolved imports. Sometimes, VS Code might not flag everything.\n\n10. **Check VS Code Settings**:\n    - Ensure that your `settings.json` within `.vscode` folder does not have conflicting paths or settings.\n\nIf these steps don't resolve the issue, please provide more information about the specific import errors you're encountering for a more targeted solution."
