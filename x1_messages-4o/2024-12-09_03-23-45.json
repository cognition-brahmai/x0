However, you can create a custom template filter to perform division.\n\nHere's how you can create a custom divide filter:\n\n1. **Create a `templatetags` directory** in one of your Django apps (if it doesn\u2019t already exist) and add an `__init__.py` file to make it a Python package.\n\n2. **Create a new Python file** within the `templatetags` directory, for example, `math_filters.py`.\n\n3. **Define the custom filter** in `math_filters.py`:\n\n   ```python\n   from django import template\n\n   register = template.Library()\n\n   @register.filter\n   def divide(value, arg):\n       try:\n           return float(value) / float(arg)\n       except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError):\n           return None\n   ```\n\n4. **Load the custom filter** in your template and use it:\n\n   ```html\n   {% load math_filters %}\n\n   {% with result=value|divide:arg %}\n       The result is: {{ result }}\n   {% endwith %}\n   ```\n\nMake sure that you handle division by zero or invalid values gracefully, as shown in the example above. This custom filter will allow you to perform division in your Django templates just like the built-in filters."
