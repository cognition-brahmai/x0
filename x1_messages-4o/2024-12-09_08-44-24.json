Here's a simple way to achieve that using the `isupper()` method and a list comprehension to filter out non-alphabetic characters:\n\n```python\ndef is_all_uppercase(s):\n    # Remove non-alphabetic characters\n    filtered_chars = [char for char in s if char.isalpha()]\n    # Check if the filtered string is not empty and all characters are uppercase\n    return filtered_chars and all(char.isupper() for char in filtered_chars)\n\n# Example usage\ntest_string = \"UPPER\u00a3CASe\"\nresult = is_all_uppercase(test_string)\nprint(result)  # Output: False\n```\n\nThis function first filters out any non-alphabetic characters from the string, then checks if all remaining characters are uppercase. If the filtered string is not empty and all characters are uppercase, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. In your case, with the string \"UPPER\u00a3CASe\", the function will return `False` because there is a lowercase 'e'."
