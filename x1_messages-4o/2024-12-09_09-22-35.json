        "content": "Certainly! Here's a basic example of how to create a neural network model using TensorFlow with two hidden layers and sigmoid activation functions:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense\n\n# Define the model\nmodel = Sequential()\n\n# Input layer and first hidden layer\nmodel.add(Dense(units=64, activation='sigmoid', input_shape=(input_dim,)))\n\n# Second hidden layer\nmodel.add(Dense(units=32, activation='sigmoid'))\n\n# Output layer\nmodel.add(Dense(units=output_dim, activation='sigmoid'))\n\n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam',\n              loss='binary_crossentropy',  # Use 'categorical_crossentropy' for multi-class classification\n              metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Summary of the model\nmodel.summary()\n\n# Note: Replace `input_dim` with the number of features in your input data,\n# and `output_dim` with the number of output classes.\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Sequential Model**: We use `Sequential()` to build a linear stack of layers.\n\n2. **Dense Layers**: \n   - The first layer (`Dense`) has 64 units and expects an input shape defined by `input_dim`. The `sigmoid` activation function is used.\n   - The second hidden layer has 32 units and also uses the `sigmoid` activation function.\n   - The output layer's `units` should match the number of classes you are predicting. For binary classification, it is typically 1 unit, and for multi-class classification, it should match the number of categories.\n\n3. **Compilation**:\n   - The `optimizer` is set to `adam`, which is a popular choice for optimization.\n   - The `loss` function is set to `binary_crossentropy` for binary classification. For multi-class classification, you would typically use `categorical_crossentropy`.\n   - The model will track `accuracy` as a metric during training.\n\n4. **Model Summary**: `model.summary()` gives an overview of the model's architecture, including the number of parameters and the shape of each layer.\n\nMake sure you replace `input_dim` and `output_dim` with the appropriate dimensions for your specific problem. The values for the number of units in each layer can also be adjusted based on your particular needs and experimentation."
