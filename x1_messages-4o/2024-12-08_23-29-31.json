        "content": "Certainly! In Excel, the standard deviation can be calculated using the `STDEV` function for a sample of data. If you have a range of values for which you want to calculate the standard deviation, you can use this formula:\n\n```excel\n=STDEV(range)\n```\n\nHere\u2019s how you can apply it:\n\n1. **Identify the Range**: Determine the range of cells that contain the data for which you want to calculate the standard deviation. For example, if your data is in cells A1 through A10, your range would be A1:A10.\n\n2. **Enter the Formula**:\n   - Click on the cell where you want the standard deviation result to appear.\n   - Type the formula `=STDEV(`.\n   - Enter the range of cells. For example, `=STDEV(A1:A10)`.\n   - Close the parenthesis and press Enter.\n\nThis will calculate the standard deviation of the values within the specified range. Note that `STDEV` is used for calculating the standard deviation of a sample. If you're working with the entire population, you should use `STDEVP` (or `STDEV.P` in more recent versions of Excel) instead."
