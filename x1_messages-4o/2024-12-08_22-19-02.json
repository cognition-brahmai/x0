In order to accomplish this, we'll need to use two tables within the database: \"labels\", which has columns for \"text\" and \"label\", and \"sentiment\", which has columns for \"text\" and \"sentiment\". Please generate a multi-step SQL query that selects the label and sentiment values from both tables, utilizing an inner join to ensure accurate matching of \"text\" values, with a conditional statement that specifies the text input \"My pet guinea pig is so cuddly and cute.\""

        "content": "To achieve the task of combining the sentiment and label for a given text using two tables (\"labels\" and \"sentiment\"), you can construct an SQL query that utilizes an inner join to match the text entries in both tables. The query will filter the results based on the specific text input \"My pet guinea pig is so cuddly and cute.\" Below is a step-by-step SQL query to accomplish this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    l.label, \n    s.sentiment\nFROM \n    labels l\nINNER JOIN \n    sentiment s \nON \n    l.text = s.text\nWHERE \n    l.text = 'My pet guinea pig is so cuddly and cute.';\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **SELECT Clause**: This part of the query specifies the columns you want to retrieve. Here, we are selecting `label` from the `labels` table and `sentiment` from the `sentiment` table.\n\n2. **FROM Clause**: This specifies the primary table (`labels`) from which to retrieve data.\n\n3. **INNER JOIN Clause**: This joins the `labels` table with the `sentiment` table on the condition that the `text` fields in both tables match. This ensures that only entries with the same `text` value in both tables are combined.\n\n4. **ON Condition**: This is the condition used in the JOIN to match rows from both tables based on the `text` column.\n\n5. **WHERE Clause**: This filters the results to only include rows where the `text` column matches the specific input \"My pet guinea pig is so cuddly and cute.\"\n\nThis query will return the label and sentiment associated with the given text, ensuring that both are derived from entries with matching text in both the `labels` and `sentiment` tables."
