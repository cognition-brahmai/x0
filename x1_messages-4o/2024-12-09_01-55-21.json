I don't want to convert my entire application to be timezone unaware just for this one legacy case. Here is the code that I have tried:\n\n```python\nPython 2.6.1 (r261:67515, Jun 24 2010, 21:47:49) \n[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5646)] on darwin\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> import datetime\n>>> import pytz\n>>> unaware = datetime.datetime(2011,8,15,8,15,12,0)\n>>> unaware\ndatetime.datetime(2011, 8, 15, 8, 15, 12)\n>>> aware = datetime.datetime(2011,8,15,8,15,12,0,pytz.UTC)\n>>> aware\ndatetime.datetime(2011, 8, 15, 8, 15, 12, tzinfo=<UTC>)\n>>> aware == unaware\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nTypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes\n```\n\nFirst, I tried astimezone:\n\n```python\n>>> unaware.astimezone(pytz.UTC)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nValueError: astimezone() cannot be applied to a naive datetime\n>>>\n```\n\nThen, I tried replace:\n\n```python\n>>> unaware.replace(tzinfo=pytz.UTC)\ndatetime.datetime(2011, 8, 15, 8, 15, 12, tzinfo=<UTC>)\n>>> unaware == aware\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nTypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes\n>>> \n```\n\nBut as you can see, replace seems to set the tzinfo, but not make the object aware. I'm using dateutil for parsing, if that matters. I've tried this in both Python 2.6 and Python 2.7, with the same results. \n\nI am writing a parser for some data files where the date string does not have a timezone indicator. I've already fixed the data source, but I still need to support the legacy data format. A one time conversion of the legacy data is not an option for various business reasons. I know with reasonable confidence that all the legacy data in question is in UTC."

        "content": "To make a timezone-unaware (`naive`) datetime object timezone-aware, you need to explicitly associate it with a timezone. The `replace()` method can be used to set the `tzinfo` attribute, but it does not convert the datetime object to a different timezone; it simply attaches the timezone information to the naive datetime object.\n\nHere's how you can make your naive datetime object timezone-aware using `pytz`:\n\n```python\nimport datetime\nimport pytz\n\n# Naive datetime object\nunaware = datetime.datetime(2011, 8, 15, 8, 15, 12)\n\n# Make it aware by setting the timezone to UTC\naware = unaware.replace(tzinfo=pytz.UTC)\n\n# Now you can compare it with other aware datetime objects\nprint(aware == datetime.datetime(2011, 8, 15, 8, 15, 12, tzinfo=pytz.UTC))  # True\n```\n\nIn this approach, you are not converting the time but merely indicating that the naive time you have is indeed in UTC. This makes the datetime object timezone-aware, and now you can safely compare it with other timezone-aware datetime objects.\n\nIf you need to convert this UTC-aware datetime to another timezone, you can use the `astimezone()` method:\n\n```python\n# Convert to another timezone, for example, US/Eastern\neastern = aware.astimezone(pytz.timezone('US/Eastern'))\nprint(eastern)\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that you are correctly handling the naive datetime as UTC and then making it comparable or convertible to other timezones."
