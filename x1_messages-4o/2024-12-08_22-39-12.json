        "content": "To compare the semantic similarity of two sentences using Natural Language Processing in Python, you can use pre-trained language models like BERT or use simpler models like word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) combined with cosine similarity. Here, I'll demonstrate a solution using the BERT model from the `transformers` library by Hugging Face to calculate the similarity score between the two sentences.\n\nFirst, ensure you have the required libraries installed:\n\n```bash\npip install transformers\npip install torch\npip install sentence-transformers\n```\n\nNow, use the following Python code to compare the semantic similarity of the sentences:\n\n```python\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util\n\n# Load a pre-trained BERT model\nmodel = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')\n\n# Define the sentences\nsentence1 = \"I want to buy a car\"\nsentence2 = \"I bought a bicycle\"\n\n# Encode the sentences into embeddings\nembedding1 = model.encode(sentence1)\nembedding2 = model.encode(sentence2)\n\n# Compute the cosine similarity\nsimilarity = util.cos_sim(embedding1, embedding2).item()\n\n# Define a threshold for semantic similarity\nthreshold = 0.5\n\n# Output True if sentences are semantically similar, False otherwise\nare_similar = similarity > threshold\nprint(are_similar)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **SentenceTransformer**: Uses a pre-trained model to get sentence embeddings.\n2. **Encoding**: Converts each sentence into a numerical vector (embedding).\n3. **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors, providing a similarity score between -1 and 1.\n4. **Threshold**: A predefined similarity score above which sentences are considered similar. In this example, a threshold of `0.5` is chosen, but you can adjust it based on your requirements.\n\nThis code will output `False` because the sentences \"I want to buy a car\" and \"I bought a bicycle\" have different semantic meanings, even though they are related to purchasing vehicles."
