Initially, I tried executing the following code: \n```javascript\n%%javascript\nIPython.OutputArea.prototype._should_scroll = function(lines) {\n    return false;\n}\n\n%run rl_base.py\n```\nHowever, I received an error stating that the 'rl_base.py' file was not found. I have already uploaded the file to Google Drive and am trying to run my '.ipynb' file, which contains the above code, from the same folder. How can I correctly run this Python script in my notebook?"
