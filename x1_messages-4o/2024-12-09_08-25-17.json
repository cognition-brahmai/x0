For example, I want to be able to do the following:\n\n```python\nmyList = [10, 20, 30]\nyourList = myList.append(40)\n```\nUnfortunately, the append() method does not return the modified list by default. Is there a way I can get this functionality?"

        "content": "In Python, the `append()` method is designed to modify the list in place and returns `None`. Therefore, it doesn't return the updated list itself. However, you can create a custom function to achieve this functionality. Here's an example of how you can define such a function:\n\n```python\ndef append_and_return(lst, item):\n    lst.append(item)\n    return lst\n\nmyList = [10, 20, 30]\nyourList = append_and_return(myList, 40)\n\nprint(yourList)  # Output: [10, 20, 30, 40]\n```\n\nIn this function, `append_and_return`, you pass the list and the item you want to append. The list is updated in place, and then the modified list is returned. This allows you to achieve the behavior you're looking for, where the updated list is assigned to `yourList`."
