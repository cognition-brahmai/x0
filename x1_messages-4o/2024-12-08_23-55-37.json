        "content": "Software development is a structured process that involves several stages to ensure the creation of high-quality software products. Here are the key stages typically involved in software development:\n\n1. **Requirement Analysis**:\n   - This initial stage involves gathering and analyzing requirements from stakeholders to understand what the software should achieve. It includes identifying user needs, defining the scope, and documenting functional and non-functional requirements.\n\n2. **Planning**:\n   - In the planning phase, the project scope is defined, resources are allocated, timelines are set, and a project plan is created. This stage helps in setting clear goals and expectations for the development process.\n\n3. **Design**:\n   - The design phase involves creating the architecture of the software. This includes defining the system\u2019s components, interfaces, and data structures. Both high-level design (system architecture) and low-level design (detailed design of components) are prepared.\n\n4. **Implementation (Coding)**:\n   - During implementation, developers write the actual code based on the design documents. This is where the software takes shape, with programmers using various programming languages and tools to build the software.\n\n5. **Testing**:\n   - Testing is crucial to ensure that the software is functioning as intended. It involves various types of testing, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing, to identify and fix defects.\n\n6. **Deployment**:\n   - Once the software has been thoroughly tested and is deemed ready, it is deployed to a production environment. This stage may involve installation, configuration, and making the software available to users.\n\n7. **Maintenance**:\n   - After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is monitored for bugs and performance issues. Updates, patches, and enhancements are made as needed to keep the software functional and up-to-date.\n\n8. **Review and Feedback**:\n   - Gathering feedback from users and stakeholders is essential for future improvements. This feedback can lead to new requirements and the beginning of a new development cycle.\n\nEach of these stages may involve iteration and feedback loops, especially in agile and iterative development methodologies, where flexibility and continuous improvement are emphasized."
