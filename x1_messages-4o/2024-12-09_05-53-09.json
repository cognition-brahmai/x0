I want to be able to call a function that does not exist in a module's statically defined attributes. And when this happens, I want to create an instance of a class in that module, and invoke the method on it with the same name as the one that failed in the attribute lookup on the module. Here's an example of what I'm trying to do:\n\n```python\nclass A(object):\n    def salutation(self, accusative):\n        print \"hello\", accusative\n\n# note this function is intentionally on the module, and not the class above\ndef __getattr__(mod, name):\n    return getattr(A(), name)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # i hope here to have my __getattr__ function above invoked, since\n    # salutation does not exist in the current namespace\n    salutation(\"world\")\n```\nBut when I run this code I get the following error:\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"getattrmod.py\", line 9, in &lt;module&gt;\n    salutation(\"world\")\nNameError: name 'salutation' is not defined\n```"

        "content": "In Python, the `__getattr__` function works for classes, but if you want similar functionality for modules, you'll need to use a slightly different approach because modules don't naturally support this mechanism.\n\nHowever, you can achieve this functionality by leveraging Python's import system and using the `sys.modules` dictionary to override the module's behavior after it's been imported. Here's a way to achieve your goal:\n\n1. Create a custom module loader that overrides the behavior of the module after it has been imported.\n2. Use this custom loader to dynamically handle attribute access.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport types\n\nclass A(object):\n    def salutation(self, accusative):\n        print(\"hello\", accusative)\n\n# Custom module class that overrides attribute access\nclass CustomModule(types.ModuleType):\n    def __getattr__(self, name):\n        # Return the method from an instance of A if it exists\n        try:\n            return getattr(A(), name)\n        except AttributeError:\n            raise AttributeError(f\"Module '{self.__name__}' has no attribute '{name}'\")\n\n# Get the current module\ncurrent_module = sys.modules[__name__]\n\n# Replace the current module in sys.modules with an instance of CustomModule\nsys.modules[__name__] = CustomModule(current_module.__name__)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Now this will invoke the dynamic __getattr__ in the CustomModule\n    salutation(\"world\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **CustomModule Class**: This class inherits from `types.ModuleType` and overrides the `__getattr__` method to provide dynamic attribute access. It tries to return a method from an instance of class `A` if the method exists.\n\n- **Replacing the Current Module**: We replace the current module in `sys.modules` with an instance of `CustomModule`, passing in the module's name. This makes Python use our custom logic for attribute access.\n\nBy doing this, when you try to access an attribute that doesn't exist directly on the module, Python will fall back to your `__getattr__` logic, allowing you to instantiate `A` and call the method on it."
