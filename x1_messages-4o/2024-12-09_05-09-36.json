For consistency, the desired format is '2011-11-03 11:07:04'. However, when I try to print the current time using `datetime.datetime.now()`, it includes the microsecond component as shown below:\n\n```python\nimport datetime\nprint(unicode(datetime.datetime.now()))\n# Output: 2011-11-03 11:13:39.278026\n```\nHow can I remove this microsecond component? Note that I'm not necessarily printing the current time, so the solution should not assume that any `datetime` instances it receives will include microsecond components."

        "content": "To convert a Python `datetime` object to a string format without the microsecond component, you can use the `strftime` method to format the `datetime` object as a string. This method allows you to specify the exact format you want, and you can omit the microsecond component by not including it in the format string.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\n# Example datetime object\ndt = datetime.datetime.now()\n\n# Formatting the datetime object to exclude microseconds\nformatted_dt = dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')\n\nprint(formatted_dt)\n```\n\nThis code will output the current time in the format `'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'`, excluding the microseconds, like `'2011-11-03 11:07:04'`.\n\nIf you have a `datetime` object with microseconds and you want to ensure that the microseconds are not included in the formatting, you can use this method regardless of whether the microsecond component is present or not. The `strftime` method will only include the components that you specify in the format string."
