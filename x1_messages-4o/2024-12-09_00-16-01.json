For reference, I am looking for the equivalent functionality provided in this normalization function:\n\n```python\ndef normalize(v):\n    norm = np.linalg.norm(v)\n    if norm == 0: \n       return v\n    return v / norm\n```\n\nThis function handles the situation where the vector `v` has the norm value of 0. Are there any similar functions provided in libraries like `sklearn` or `numpy`?"

        "content": "Certainly! Normalizing a NumPy array into a unit vector is a common operation, and the function you provided is a good way to handle it manually. However, if you are looking for built-in functions in libraries like `scikit-learn` or `numpy`, you have a few options.\n\n### Using NumPy\n\nAlthough NumPy doesn't have a direct function for normalizing vectors to unit length, your custom function is a perfect way to do this. However, if you prefer using a built-in approach, you can use `numpy` for the same as follows:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef normalize(v):\n    norm = np.linalg.norm(v)\n    if norm == 0: \n       return v\n    return v / norm\n```\n\n### Using Scikit-learn\n\nScikit-learn does provide functionalities for normalization, but it's more oriented towards feature scaling in datasets rather than individual vector normalization. However, you can use `sklearn.preprocessing.normalize` for a similar effect on 2D arrays (treating them as datasets):\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import normalize\n\n# For a single vector, reshape it to 2D\nv = np.array([1, 2, 3])\nv_normalized = normalize(v.reshape(1, -1), norm='l2')[0]\n```\n\nIn this case, `normalize` acts on rows, so reshaping the vector to 2D is necessary. The `'l2'` norm parameter ensures it normalizes to a unit vector.\n\n### Summary\n\nYour custom function is concise and effectively handles the zero-norm case. If you prefer using a library function, `sklearn.preprocessing.normalize` is useful, especially for batch processing in 2D arrays. For single vectors, using your custom implementation or adapting it to use `numpy` directly, as shown, is a good approach."
