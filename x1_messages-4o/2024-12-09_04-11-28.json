Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:\n\n1. **Install the Jupyter Notebook extensions:** \n   You'll need to install Jupyter Notebook extensions if you haven't already. You can do this using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions\n   jupyter contrib nbextension install --user\n   ```\n\n2. **Enable the Hinterland extension:**\n   After installing the extensions, you need to enable the Hinterland extension, which provides live autocompletion.\n\n   - Open a terminal and run:\n\n     ```bash\n     jupyter nbextension enable hinterland/hinterland\n     ```\n\n   - Alternatively, you can enable it via the Jupyter Notebook dashboard:\n     - Start Jupyter Notebook by running `jupyter notebook` in the terminal.\n     - Go to the Nbextensions tab.\n     - Find and check the box for \"Hinterland - Enable code autocompletion in the notebook cells\".\n\n3. **Restart Jupyter Notebook:**\n   Once you've enabled the Hinterland extension, restart your Jupyter Notebook server to apply the changes.\n\nAfter completing these steps, you should see autocompletion suggestions automatically as you type, without the need to press the Tab key. If it doesn't work immediately, make sure to refresh your browser or clear the cache."
