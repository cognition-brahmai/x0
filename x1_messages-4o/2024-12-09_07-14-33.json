When I run the code, I get a warning stating \"SyntaxWarning: name 'ret_code' is assigned to before global declaration global ret_code\". What is the cause of this warning? Here is the code snippet:\n\n```python\nret_code = 0\n\ndef some_func():\n  global ret_code\n  ...\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n  global ret_code\n  ...\n```\n\nI understand that I can avoid this warning by assigning the value 0 to 'ret_code' after the global declaration like so:\n\n```python\ndef some_func():\n  global ret_code\n  ...\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n  global ret_code\n  ret_code = 0\n  ...\n```\n\nHowever, I am interested in understanding what exactly was wrong with the original code."

        "content": "The warning you are encountering is due to the order of operations in your code regarding the global variable declaration. In Python, when you declare a variable as `global` inside a function or a block, it tells the interpreter that the variable is defined outside the local scope, and you plan to use or modify it.\n\nIn your original code snippet:\n\n```python\nret_code = 0\n\ndef some_func():\n  global ret_code\n  ...\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n  global ret_code\n  ...\n```\n\nThe variable `ret_code` is assigned a value before you explicitly declare it as `global` within the `main` block. The `global` statement is meant to indicate that the variable `ret_code` is defined outside the local scope and that any operations on it should refer to the global variable. However, since you have already assigned a value to `ret_code` before declaring it as `global`, this causes the interpreter to give a warning because it expects the global declaration to occur before any assignments in the local scope.\n\nHere's what the warning is essentially saying: \"You are assigning a value to `ret_code` before you've told me that it's supposed to be a global variable within this scope.\" This can lead to confusion and potentially unexpected behavior in more complex scripts, as it might not be clear at first glance whether `ret_code` was intended to be a global variable from the start.\n\nBy moving the `global ret_code` declaration before any assignment in a function or a block, you clarify to the interpreter and anyone reading the code that `ret_code` is a global variable, and you intend to operate on the global instance of it.\n\nSo, when you adjust your code to assign a value to `ret_code` after declaring it as `global`, you are aligning with the expected practice and avoiding potential issues or misunderstandings:\n\n```python\ndef some_func():\n  global ret_code\n  ...\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n  global ret_code\n  ret_code = 0\n  ...\n```\n\nThis way, the interpreter knows right from the top of each scope that `ret_code` is a global variable, and it will handle it accordingly."
