The error message states: \"type object 'datetime.datetime' has no attribute 'datetime'\". This error occurs when I try to execute the following line of code: `date = datetime.datetime(int(year), int(month), 1)`. For additional context, I am importing datetime using `from datetime import datetime`. What could be the reason for this error?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the way you're importing the `datetime` module. When you use the line `from datetime import datetime`, you're importing the `datetime` class directly from the `datetime` module. This means that you should directly use `datetime` to create a date, rather than `datetime.datetime`.\n\nHere is how you should modify your code:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Assuming year and month are defined\ndate = datetime(int(year), int(month), 1)\n```\n\nBy importing `datetime` this way, you have direct access to the `datetime` class and can instantiate it without having to prefix it with `datetime.`. \n\nIf you prefer to import the entire `datetime` module, you could do it like this:\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\n# Then you would use the full path\ndate = datetime.datetime(int(year), int(month), 1)\n```\n\nMake sure to choose one of these import styles and stick with it throughout your code to avoid any confusion."
