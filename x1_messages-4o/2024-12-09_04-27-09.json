However, I would like to change the figure size to exactly 4 by 3 inches and the format to TIFF. How can I modify my current code to achieve this?\n\nHere is the code I am currently using:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nlist1 = [3,4,5,6,9,12]\nlist2 = [8,12,14,15,17,20]\n\nplt.plot(list1, list2)\nplt.savefig('fig1.png', dpi = 300)\nplt.close()\n```"

        "content": "To modify your matplotlib figure to have a specific size of 4 by 3 inches and save it in TIFF format, you can use the `figsize` parameter in the `plt.figure()` function and change the format in the `savefig()` method. Here\u2019s how you can adjust your code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nlist1 = [3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12]\nlist2 = [8, 12, 14, 15, 17, 20]\n\n# Set the figure size\nplt.figure(figsize=(4, 3))\n\n# Plot the data\nplt.plot(list1, list2)\n\n# Save the figure as a TIFF with a dpi of 300\nplt.savefig('fig1.tiff', dpi=300, format='tiff')\n\n# Close the plot\nplt.close()\n```\n\nThis code will create a plot with a figure size of 4 by 3 inches and save it as a TIFF file named 'fig1.tiff' with a DPI of 300."
