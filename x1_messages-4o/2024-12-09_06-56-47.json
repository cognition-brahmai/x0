        "content": "The issue you're encountering with `pip` is likely due to `pip` not using the same certificate store or configuration as `curl`. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Upgrade `pip`**: The version 1.4.1 is quite old. Consider upgrading to a more recent version of `pip` which may have improved SSL handling. You can upgrade `pip` using:\n   ```bash\n   python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Certificates**:\n   - Make sure the root certificate is installed in a location where Python's `ssl` module can access it. This is often `/etc/ssl/certs/` on Linux systems, but it may vary.\n\n3. **Set `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` Environment Variable**:\n   - Set the `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` environment variable to point to your root certificate file. You can do this by adding the following line to your shell configuration file (like `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`):\n     ```bash\n     export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/path/to/root-certificate.crt\n     ```\n   - Reload the shell configuration by running `source ~/.bashrc` or restarting the terminal.\n\n4. **Use `--cert` Option**:\n   - You can specify the certificate directly when using `pip` by providing the `--cert` option:\n     ```bash\n     pip install --cert /path/to/root-certificate.crt <package-name>\n     ```\n\n5. **Verify Python SSL Configuration**:\n   - Make sure that your Python installation is configured to use OpenSSL and has access to the correct certificate store.\n\n6. **Check Python Version**:\n   - Ensure that your Python version is up-to-date as older versions might have limitations or bugs in SSL handling.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the certificate verification issue with `pip`. If the issue persists, consider checking if there are specific configuration settings or network policies that might be affecting `pip` differently than `curl`."
