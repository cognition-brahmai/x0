I want to create this legend \"from scratch\", without any associated data, and the color is a significant attribute for each marker. I have tried using the 'MarkerStyle' class and the 'legend' function, but I am encountering issues. The 'MarkerStyle' class does not support color information and I receive a warning that the legend does not support 'MarkerStyle' instances, suggesting that a proxy artist may be used instead. How can I define a proxy artist based on a marker?\n\nCode:\n```python\nimport matplotlib.markers as mmark\nlist_mak = [mmark.MarkerStyle('.'),mmark.MarkerStyle(','),mmark.MarkerStyle('o')]\nlist_lab = ['Marker 1','Marker 2','Marker 3']\n\nplt.legend(list_mak,list_lab)\n```\nWarnings:\n```python\nUserWarning: Legend does not support <matplotlib.markers.MarkerStyle object at 0x7fca640c44d0> instances.\nA proxy artist may be used instead.\n```"

        "content": "To create a custom legend with colored markers without any associated data in Matplotlib, you can use proxy artists. Proxy artists are dummy artists that are used solely for creating custom legends. Here's how you can define proxy artists using `Line2D` from the `matplotlib.lines` module:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib.lines import Line2D\n\n# Define your markers, labels, and colors\nlist_mak = ['.', ',', 'o']\nlist_lab = ['Marker 1', 'Marker 2', 'Marker 3']\nlist_col = ['red', 'green', 'blue']\n\n# Create proxy artists for each marker\nproxy_artists = [Line2D([0], [0], marker=marker, color='w', markerfacecolor=color, markersize=10, linestyle='None') \n                 for marker, color in zip(list_mak, list_col)]\n\n# Create the legend using these proxy artists\nplt.legend(proxy_artists, list_lab)\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Line2D Proxy:** `Line2D` is used to create a proxy artist for each marker. \n- **Properties:** Set the `marker` to the desired shape, `color` to `'w'` (white or any background color) to ensure the line doesn't show, `markerfacecolor` to the color you want, and `linestyle` to `'None'` to avoid any lines connecting the markers.\n- **Legend:** Use `plt.legend()` to create the legend with the proxy artists.\n\nThis approach allows you to create a legend with colored markers that don't require any data to be plotted first."
