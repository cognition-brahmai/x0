I am trying to get the same result as the command line: 'scrapy crawl linkedin_anonymous -a first=James -a last=Bond -o output.json'. However, it seems that process.crawl() in my script is creating another LinkedInAnonymousSpider where \"first\" and \"last\" are None. Is there a way to pass these arguments to process.crawl()?\n\nHere is the script I am using:\n\n```python\nimport scrapy\nfrom linkedin_anonymous_spider import LinkedInAnonymousSpider\nfrom scrapy.crawler import CrawlerProcess\nfrom scrapy.utils.project import get_project_settings\n\nspider = LinkedInAnonymousSpider(None, \"James\", \"Bond\")\nprocess = CrawlerProcess(get_project_settings())\nprocess.crawl(spider) # <--- (1)\nprocess.start()\n```\n\nAnd here is the LinkedInAnonymousSpider class I am using:\n\n```python\nfrom logging import INFO\n\nimport scrapy\n\nclass LinkedInAnonymousSpider(scrapy.Spider):\n    name = \"linkedin_anonymous\"\n    allowed_domains = [\"linkedin.com\"]\n    start_urls = []\n\n    base_url = \"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/dir/?first=%s&last=%s&search=Search\"\n\n    def __init__(self, input = None, first= None, last=None):\n        self.input = input  # source file name\n        self.first = first\n        self.last = last\n\n    def start_requests(self):\n        print self.first # <--- (2)\n        if self.first and self.last: # taking input from command line parameters\n                url = self.base_url % (self.first, self.last)\n                yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)\n\n    def parse(self, response): . . .\n```"

        "content": "To pass arguments to `process.crawl()` in Scrapy, you should pass the spider class along with the arguments in a dictionary, rather than creating an instance of the spider yourself. This ensures that Scrapy can properly handle the spider's lifecycle and pass in the arguments as expected. \n\nHere's how you can adjust your script to achieve the same result as the command line:\n\n```python\nimport scrapy\nfrom scrapy.crawler import CrawlerProcess\nfrom scrapy.utils.project import get_project_settings\nfrom linkedin_anonymous_spider import LinkedInAnonymousSpider\n\n# Create the CrawlerProcess with the project settings\nprocess = CrawlerProcess(get_project_settings())\n\n# Pass the spider class and the arguments to process.crawl()\nprocess.crawl(LinkedInAnonymousSpider, first=\"James\", last=\"Bond\")\n\n# Start the crawling process\nprocess.start()\n```\n\nWith this change, Scrapy will create an instance of `LinkedInAnonymousSpider` and pass the `first` and `last` arguments to its `__init__` method, similar to how it works with command-line arguments. \n\nAlso, ensure that the `__init__` method in your `LinkedInAnonymousSpider` class can accept these arguments, which you have already done correctly:\n\n```python\ndef __init__(self, input=None, first=None, last=None):\n    self.input = input  # source file name\n    self.first = first\n    self.last = last\n```\n\nThis should correctly print `James` and `Bond` when the `start_requests` method is called, and generate the URLs as expected."
