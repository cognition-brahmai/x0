I have a `print_message(msg)` method in module `a.py` which is imported into module `b.py` using `from a import print_message`. I then execute the function in module `b.py` from a third module, `c.py`. I would like to override the `print_message(msg)` method without changing the code in `a.py` or `b.py` modules. When I use `import a` and `a.print_message`, my changes are reflected but when I use `from...import`, the original method is imported. How can I overcome this problem? I've tried using the following code:\n```python\n# c.py module\nimport b\nimport a\nimport sys\ndef new_print_message(msg):\n    print(\"New content\")\nmodule = sys.modules[\"a\"]\nmodule.print_message = new_print_message\nsys.module[\"a\"] = module\n```\nThis works when I use `import a` but not when I use the `from...import` statement. I want to avoid changing the code in `b.py` and `a.py` modules."

        "content": "When using `from a import print_message`, the `print_message` function is directly imported into the namespace of `b.py`. This means that any subsequent changes to `a.print_message` will not affect the reference to `print_message` in `b.py`. \n\nTo override the function without changing the code in `a.py` or `b.py`, you can patch the function after the import in `c.py` using the `unittest.mock` module, which allows you to temporarily replace parts of your system for testing purposes. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# c.py module\nimport b\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\n\ndef new_print_message(msg):\n    print(\"New content\")\n\n# Patch the 'print_message' function in module 'b'\nwith patch('b.print_message', new_print_message):\n    b.print_message(\"Test message\")\n\n# If you want to maintain the override for further calls without a context manager, you can use:\npatcher = patch('b.print_message', new_print_message)\npatcher.start()\n\n# Call the function\nb.print_message(\"Another test message\")\n\n# Stop the patcher when done\npatcher.stop()\n```\n\nThis code uses `unittest.mock.patch` to temporarily replace `print_message` in `b.py` with `new_print_message`. The `patch` function can be used as a context manager or started/stopped manually to control the duration of the monkey patch.\n\nIf you need the override to persist for the entire runtime of your `c.py` script, you can use the `patcher.start()` and `patcher.stop()` approach. This ensures that the `new_print_message` function is used whenever `b.print_message()` is called."
