For instance, `timestamp=\"(date +\"%T\")\"` just prints out `(date +\"%T\")` and `timestamp=\"$(date +\"%T\")\"` only prints the time when the variable was initialized."

This way, it will execute the `date` command each time you use it. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```bash\ntimestamp() {\n    date +\"%T\"\n}\n\n# Usage\necho $(timestamp)\n```\n\nIn this example, `timestamp` is a function that calls `date +\"%T\"` to get the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds. Every time you call `$(timestamp)`, it will execute the `date` command and provide the current time."
