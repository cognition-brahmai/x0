        "content": "To avoid the HTTP Error 429 (Too Many Requests) when accessing a website, you need to implement a few strategies to ensure that you are not overwhelming the server with requests. Here are some approaches you can take:\n\n1. **Use Exponential Backoff**: Instead of a fixed `time.sleep()`, use an exponential backoff strategy where you increase the wait time after each request. This is more adaptive and can help you manage requests more effectively.\n\n2. **Respect Rate Limits**: Check the website's terms of service or API documentation to understand their rate limits. This will give you an idea of how frequently you can make requests without triggering a 429 error.\n\n3. **Add Random Delays**: Introduce random sleep intervals between requests to mimic human-like behavior and reduce the chance of hitting rate limits.\n\n4. **Use Proxies**: If the website allows it and it aligns with their terms of service, you can use proxy servers to distribute requests, reducing the load from a single IP address.\n\n5. **Check for Retry-After Header**: When you receive a 429 error, check if the response includes a `Retry-After` header. This header tells you how long to wait before making the next request.\n\nHere's how you can implement these strategies in your code:\n\n```python\nimport mechanize\nimport cookielib\nimport re\nimport time\nimport random\n\nurls_list = [\n    \"example.com/page1\",\n    \"example.com/page2\",\n    \"example.com/page3\",\n    \"example.com/page4\"\n]\n\nbr = mechanize.Browser()\ncj = cookielib.LWPCookieJar()\nbr.set_cookiejar(cj)\n\nbr.set_handle_equiv(True)\nbr.set_handle_redirect(True)\nbr.set_handle_referer(True)\nbr.set_handle_robots(False)\n\nbr.open(\"example.com\")\nbr.select_form(nr=0)\nbr[\"username\"] = \"username\"\nbr[\"password\"] = \"password\"\nbr.submit()\n\ndef request_with_backoff(url):\n    backoff_time = 1\n    max_backoff = 60  # Max wait time in seconds\n    while True:\n        try:\n            response = br.open(url)\n            content = response.read()\n            print(re.findall(\"Some String\", content))\n            break  # Exit loop after successful request\n        except mechanize.HTTPError as e:\n            if e.code == 429:\n                print(f\"Received 429, retrying after {backoff_time} seconds...\")\n                time.sleep(backoff_time)\n                backoff_time = min(max_backoff, backoff_time * 2)  # Exponential backoff\n            else:\n                raise  # Re-raise the error if it's not 429\n        # Add random delay to avoid pattern detection\n        time.sleep(random.uniform(1, 3))\n\nfor url in urls_list:\n    request_with_backoff(url)\n```\n\nThis code uses exponential backoff and a random delay to reduce the likelihood of triggering rate limits. Make sure you adjust the parameters based on the specific website's requirements and policies."
