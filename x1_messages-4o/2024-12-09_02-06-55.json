I assumed that the hash() function should work consistently across all Python interpreters, but observed a difference when running it on my mobile using Python for Android. I found that while the hash values for strings and numbers were consistent, the hash value for built-in data types differed. For example, on my PC Python Interpreter (version 2.7.3), the hash value for int was 31585118, but on my Mobile Python Interpreter (version 2.6.2) the hash value for int was -2146549248. Is this a bug, or have I misunderstood something about how the hash function works?"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is not a bug but rather an expected result due to the differences in Python implementations and versions. Here are a few reasons why hash values might differ across platforms and Python versions:\n\n1. **Python Version Differences**: You're comparing hash values between Python 2.7.3 and 2.6.2. Different Python versions may have changes in the hash function implementations for certain data types, which can result in different hash values.\n\n2. **Platform Differences**: Hash functions can be platform-dependent, especially when it comes to native data types like integers. Different platforms (e.g., different operating systems or architectures) might handle integer representation and arithmetic differently, leading to different hash values.\n\n3. **Hash Randomization**: Starting with Python 3.3, hash randomization is enabled by default to improve security, particularly against certain types of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. However, since you're using Python 2, this should not be a factor, but it's worth mentioning for completeness.\n\n4. **Implementation Details**: The internal implementation details of Python can vary between different distributions and builds, potentially affecting how the hash function behaves.\n\nIn summary, it is important to remember that hash values are not guaranteed to be consistent across different versions and platforms. If you need a consistent hash value across different environments, consider using a custom hash function or a third-party library specifically designed to provide consistent hashing, such as hashlib with a specific algorithm (e.g., SHA256)."
