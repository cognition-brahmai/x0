        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to the Keras `ProgbarLogger` callback, which is used to display progress during training. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `log_values` attribute, which is not being set correctly.\n\nThere are a few possible reasons for this error, and potential solutions you can try:\n\n1. **Validation Split Issue**: \n   ```plaintext\n   Train on 0 samples, validate on 1 samples\n   ```\n   This suggests that the `validation_split=0.7` is causing all of your data to be used for validation and none for training. Since your dataset is very small (only 1 sample), using a validation split of 0.7 is not feasible. Try using a smaller validation split or use more data for training:\n\n   ```python\n   history = model.fit(X, y, batch_size=1, epochs=25, validation_split=0.0)\n   ```\n\n2. **Data Shape Mismatch**:\n   Ensure that your input data shapes are correct. The input shape of the model should match the shape of `X`. Also, make sure that `y` has the correct shape for your loss function. If you're using `sparse_categorical_crossentropy`, `y` should be a 1D array of integers (class labels).\n\n3. **Keras Version**:\n   If you're using an older version of Keras, try updating it to the latest version. There could be a bug in the version you're using. You can update Keras using:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade keras\n   ```\n\n4. **Handling Small Datasets**:\n   With such a small dataset, training a deep learning model may not be feasible. Consider using data augmentation or acquiring more data to make the model training meaningful.\n\nAfter making these changes, try running your code again and see if the error persists. If it does, consider checking the compatibility of the Keras version with your TensorFlow backend, as mismatches can sometimes cause unexpected errors."
