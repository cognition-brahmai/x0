I am trying to write a method `detType` that checks if `self.a`, `self.b`, and `self.c` are greater than 0. If the conditions are met, it would mean that I have Angle, Angle, Angle. I am currently facing an issue with using the AND and NOT operators in Python. I have tried checking for `self.a` and `self.b` with the expression `self.a != 0 & self.b != 0` but it doesn't produce the expected results. When I use just `self.a != 0`, it works fine. I am not sure if I am using the AND operator correctly. Any suggestions on how to correct this? I am calling the function with the command `print myTri.detType()`."

        "content": "It looks like you are encountering an issue with the use of the bitwise AND operator (`&`) instead of the logical AND operator (`and`) in Python. In Python, the logical operators `and`, `or`, and `not` are used to combine conditional statements. The bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `~`) are used for bit-level operations on integers, and they won't work as expected for logical comparisons.\n\nHere's how you can write your `detType` method using the correct logical operators:\n\n```python\nclass Triangle:\n    def __init__(self, a, b, c, d, e, f):\n        self.a = a\n        self.b = b\n        self.c = c\n        self.d = d\n        self.e = e\n        self.f = f\n\n    def detType(self):\n        if self.a > 0 and self.b > 0 and self.c > 0:\n            return \"Angle, Angle, Angle\"\n        else:\n            return \"Not a valid triangle type\"\n\n# Example usage\nmyTri = Triangle(30, 60, 90, 0, 0, 0)\nprint(myTri.detType())\n```\n\nIn this corrected code, the `detType` method uses the `and` operator to ensure that all conditions (`self.a > 0`, `self.b > 0`, and `self.c > 0`) are true. If all conditions are met, it returns \"Angle, Angle, Angle\". Otherwise, it returns \"Not a valid triangle type\".\n\nMake sure you replace your bitwise operator `&` with the logical operator `and` to achieve the intended functionality."
