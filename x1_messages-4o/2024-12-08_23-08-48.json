        "content": "Your Swift function `sumOfSquareAreas` is correctly implemented to calculate the sum of the areas of two squares given their side lengths. Here's a breakdown of the code and how it works:\n\n1. **Function Definition**:\n   ```swift\n   func sumOfSquareAreas(_ side1: Double, _ side2: Double) -> Double {\n       let area1 = pow(side1, 2)\n       let area2 = pow(side2, 2)\n       return area1 + area2\n   }\n   ```\n   - The function `sumOfSquareAreas` takes two `Double` parameters, `side1` and `side2`, representing the side lengths of the two squares.\n   - It calculates the area of each square using `pow(side1, 2)` and `pow(side2, 2)`.\n   - It returns the sum of these two areas.\n\n2. **Usage**:\n   ```swift\n   let square1 = 5.0\n   let square2 = 10.0\n   let totalArea = sumOfSquareAreas(square1, square2)\n   print(\"The sum of the areas of the two squares is \\(totalArea) square cm.\")\n   ```\n   - You define two variables `square1` and `square2` to store the side lengths of the squares.\n   - You call the `sumOfSquareAreas` function with these side lengths and store the result in `totalArea`.\n   - Finally, you print the total area.\n\nWhen you run this code, the output will be:\n\n```\nThe sum of the areas of the two squares is 125.0 square cm.\n```\n\nThis output is correct because the area of the first square (side 5 cm) is \\(5^2 = 25\\) square cm, and the area of the second square (side 10 cm) is \\(10^2 = 100\\) square cm. The sum of these areas is \\(25 + 100 = 125\\) square cm."
