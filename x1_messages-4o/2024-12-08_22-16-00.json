        "content": "How can I divide a rectangular-shaped cake measuring 10 inches by 6 inches into two pieces of equal shape and size, but with one piece weighing twice as much as the other using a single cut? \n[formula] One way to achieve this is by cutting the cake along a line that passes through the center of the shorter side of the rectangle (i.e., along the 6-inch side), dividing the cake into two 6x5 inch pieces. Then, weigh each piece using the scale. If one piece weighs x ounces, the other piece will weigh 2x ounces."

        "content": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of density distribution. We assume that the cake has varying density along its length, such that one side is denser than the other. \n\nTo achieve the desired division with a single cut, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Determine the Density Gradient:** Assume that the density of the cake varies linearly from one side to the other along its length. For instance, one side (let's say the left side of the 10-inch edge) has a density of 3 units per square inch, and the other side (right side) has a density of 1 unit per square inch.\n\n2. **Identify the Line of Division:** The line should be parallel to the shorter edge (6-inch side) of the rectangle. Let's call the position of the cut from the denser side \\( x \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Weight of Each Piece:**\n   - The weight of a piece is the integral of its density over its area.\n   - To find the position \\( x \\) where one piece weighs twice as much as the other, set up the equation based on the density function.\n\n4. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   Since we want one piece to weigh twice as much as the other, integrate the density function over the length of the rectangle and solve for \\( x \\) such that the area under the curve from 0 to \\( x \\) results in one piece weighing twice as much as from \\( x \\) to 10.\n\nFor simplicity, this involves solving the integral equation:\n\\[ \\int_{0}^{x} (3 - (3 - 1)\\frac{y}{10}) \\, dy = 2 \\times \\int_{x}^{10} (3 - (3 - 1)\\frac{y}{10}) \\, dy \\]\n\nSolving this will give you the exact position \\( x \\) where you need to make the cut to achieve the desired weight distribution while keeping the shape identical."
