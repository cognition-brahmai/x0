My code is contained in a single, lengthy `main.py` file and I would like to split it up. What is the standard way Python programmers organize multiple source files? Should each class be in a separate file? How should I organize unit tests relative to source code? Where should I put doc comments, especially those for command-line operation? If I use multiple directories, how do I import classes between them?"

        "content": "Organizing a Python project effectively involves several considerations. Here's a standard approach to structuring your Python project, especially when dealing with multiple threads and command-line operations:\n\n1. **Project Directory Structure**: \n   - Create a root directory for your project. Inside this, create separate directories for your source code, tests, and other resources like documentation.\n   - A typical project structure might look like this:\n     ```\n     my_project/\n     \u251c\u2500\u2500 my_package/\n     \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n     \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 module1.py\n     \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 module2.py\n     \u251c\u2500\u2500 tests/\n     \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n     \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 test_module1.py\n     \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 test_module2.py\n     \u251c\u2500\u2500 docs/\n     \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 usage.md\n     \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.py\n     \u251c\u2500\u2500 requirements.txt\n     \u2514\u2500\u2500 README.md\n     ```\n\n2. **Splitting Code Into Modules**:\n   - Group related classes and functions into modules (i.e., `.py` files) within the `my_package` directory. \n   - If a module becomes too large, consider splitting it into submodules or packages (subdirectories with an `__init__.py` file).\n\n3. **Organizing Classes and Functions**:\n   - There\u2019s no strict rule that each class must be in a separate file, but it's common to group related classes and functions together. For example, classes and functions related to a specific functionality or component can be in one module.\n\n4. **Unit Tests**:\n   - Place your tests in a separate `tests` directory. Use a similar structure to your source code for easy navigation. Each source file should have a corresponding test file, e.g., `module1.py` would be tested by `test_module1.py`.\n\n5. **Doc Comments and Documentation**:\n   - Use docstrings in your Python code for documentation. This is typically placed at the beginning of modules, classes, and functions.\n   - For command-line usage documentation, you might include this in a `docs/` directory as separate markdown files or in the `README.md`.\n\n6. **Imports**:\n   - Use relative imports within your package. For example, if `module1.py` needs to import a class from `module2.py`, you would use:\n     ```python\n     from .module2 import SomeClass\n     ```\n   - When running scripts, ensure the top-level directory is in your `PYTHONPATH` or use absolute imports. You can also use the following structure in your `main.py`:\n     ```python\n     from my_package.module1 import SomeClass\n     ```\n   - To run the package as a script, you might use:\n     ```bash\n     python -m my_package.main\n     ```\n\n7. **Thread Management**:\n   - Ensure that your code is thread-safe and properly manages resources. Consider using threading-specific libraries like `concurrent.futures` or `threading`.\n\nBy organizing your project in this way, you improve readability, maintainability, and scalability, making it easier for others (and yourself) to understand and contribute to your project over time."
