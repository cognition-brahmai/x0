        "content": "Certainly! To solve this problem, let's suppose we have a SQL database with the following tables:\n\n1. **Products**: Contains product information.\n   - `product_id`\n   - `product_name` (either 'iPhone' or 'Samsung Galaxy')\n   - `base_price`\n\n2. **Sales**: Contains sales information.\n   - `sale_id`\n   - `product_id`\n   - `quantity_sold`\n\n3. **Companies**: Contains company information.\n   - `company_id`\n   - `company_name` (either 'Apple' or 'Samsung')\n\n4. **Product_Company**: Maps products to their respective companies.\n   - `product_id`\n   - `company_id`\n\nGiven that the iPhone is sold at a price twice that of the Samsung Galaxy, we'll assume the `base_price` in the `Products` table reflects the price of the Samsung Galaxy, while the price for the iPhone is twice that `base_price`.\n\nHere's a multi-step SQL query to calculate the revenue generated by each company and the difference in revenue between them:\n\n```sql\n-- Step 1: Calculate the total revenue for each product\nWITH ProductRevenue AS (\n    SELECT \n        p.product_id,\n        p.product_name,\n        SUM(CASE \n            WHEN p.product_name = 'iPhone' THEN s.quantity_sold * (p.base_price * 2)\n            WHEN p.product_name = 'Samsung Galaxy' THEN s.quantity_sold * p.base_price\n            ELSE 0\n        END) AS total_revenue\n    FROM \n        Products p\n    JOIN \n        Sales s ON p.product_id = s.product_id\n    GROUP BY \n        p.product_id, p.product_name\n),\n\n-- Step 2: Calculate the total revenue for each company\nCompanyRevenue AS (\n    SELECT \n        c.company_id,\n        c.company_name,\n        SUM(pr.total_revenue) AS company_revenue\n    FROM \n        ProductRevenue pr\n    JOIN \n        Product_Company pc ON pr.product_id = pc.product_id\n    JOIN \n        Companies c ON pc.company_id = c.company_id\n    GROUP BY \n        c.company_id, c.company_name\n)\n\n-- Step 3: Calculate the difference in revenue between the companies\nSELECT \n    cr1.company_name AS company_1,\n    cr1.company_revenue AS revenue_1,\n    cr2.company_name AS company_2,\n    cr2.company_revenue AS revenue_2,\n    ABS(cr1.company_revenue - cr2.company_revenue) AS revenue_difference\nFROM \n    CompanyRevenue cr1\nJOIN \n    CompanyRevenue cr2 ON cr1.company_id < cr2.company_id;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Step 1**: The `ProductRevenue` CTE calculates the total revenue for each product. It uses the `base_price` directly for Samsung Galaxy and twice the `base_price` for iPhone.\n\n- **Step 2**: The `CompanyRevenue` CTE aggregates the product revenues to the company level by joining with `Product_Company` and `Companies` tables.\n\n- **Step 3**: The final query calculates the difference in revenue between the two companies by self-joining the `CompanyRevenue` table and computing the absolute difference in their revenues.\n\nThis solution assumes that there are only two companies: Apple and Samsung, corresponding to iPhone and Samsung Galaxy, respectively. Adjust the query if there are additional complexities or more companies involved."
