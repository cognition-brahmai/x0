Each type of clothing has a different base price, and your brand offers discounts based on the number of items purchased.\nHere are some facts about your brand's sales:\n- 30% of the total sales come from selling shirts, with an average discount of 10% for buying 2 or more shirts\n- 20% of the total sales come from selling pants, with an average discount of 15% for buying 3 or more pants\n- 15% of the total sales come from selling dresses, with an average discount of 20% for buying 2 or more dresses\n- 35% of the total sales come from selling jackets, with an average discount of 25% for buying 4 or more jackets\n- The total revenue generated from selling 2 shirts, 1 pair of pants, 1 dress, and 1 jacket is $400.\nCan you use your math skills to determine the base price of each type of clothing and the total revenue generated from selling 3 shirts, 2 pants, 2 dresses, and 3 jackets with applicable discounts?"

        "content": "Certainly! To determine the base price of each type of clothing, we need to set up some equations based on the information provided.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( S \\) as the base price of a shirt,\n- \\( P \\) as the base price of a pair of pants,\n- \\( D \\) as the base price of a dress,\n- \\( J \\) as the base price of a jacket.\n\nGiven that the total revenue from selling 2 shirts, 1 pair of pants, 1 dress, and 1 jacket is $400, we can set up the following equation considering the discounts:\n\n1. The revenue from 2 shirts with a 10% discount is: \\( 2 \\times S \\times (1 - 0.10) = 1.8S \\)\n2. Revenue from 1 pair of pants (no discount) is: \\( P \\)\n3. Revenue from 1 dress (no discount) is: \\( D \\)\n4. Revenue from 1 jacket (no discount) is: \\( J \\)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\[ 1.8S + P + D + J = 400 \\]\n\nNow, using the percentage of total sales for each clothing type, we can set up the following relations:\n- \\( 0.30 \\times \\text{Total Sales} = \\text{Sales from shirts} = \\text{Quantity of shirts sold} \\times \\text{Price per shirt} \\)\n- \\( 0.20 \\times \\text{Total Sales} = \\text{Sales from pants} = \\text{Quantity of pants sold} \\times \\text{Price per pant} \\)\n- \\( 0.15 \\times \\text{Total Sales} = \\text{Sales from dresses} = \\text{Quantity of dresses sold} \\times \\text{Price per dress} \\)\n- \\( 0.35 \\times \\text{Total Sales} = \\text{Sales from jackets} = \\text{Quantity of jackets sold} \\times \\text{Price per jacket} \\)\n\nUnfortunately, we do not have the exact quantities sold for each type, but we know how the discounts apply. To find the base prices, let's try solving the equations by assuming the percentage contributions directly relate to the sales value:\n\nLet's solve this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Base Revenue without Discounts:**\n   - Shirts: \\( 0.30 \\times \\text{Total Sales} = 1.8S \\)\n   - Pants: \\( 0.20 \\times \\text{Total Sales} = P \\)\n   - Dresses: \\( 0.15 \\times \\text{Total Sales} = D \\)\n   - Jackets: \\( 0.35 \\times \\text{Total Sales} = J \\)\n\n2. **Solving the Equation:**\n   - Since the equation \\( 1.8S + P + D + J = 400 \\) is balanced by the revenue proportions, we can assume that the actual price contributions are aligned with these proportions.\n\n3. **Find Total Sales:**\n   - Total Sales = \\( 1.8S + P + D + J = 400 \\)\n\nNow, let's calculate the total revenue generated from selling 3 shirts, 2 pants, 2 dresses, and 3 jackets with applicable discounts:\n\n1. Revenue from 3 shirts with a 10% discount: \\( 3 \\times S \\times (1 - 0.10) = 2.7S \\)\n2. Revenue from 2 pants with a 15% discount: \\( 2 \\times P \\times (1 - 0.15) = 1.7P \\)\n3. Revenue from 2 dresses with a 20% discount: \\( 2 \\times D \\times (1 - 0.20) = 1.6D \\)\n4. Revenue from 3 jackets with a 25% discount: \\( 3 \\times J \\times (1 - 0.25) = 2.25J \\)\n\nBringing it all together:\n\\[ \\text{Total Revenue} = 2.7S + 1.7P + 1.6D + 2.25J \\]\n\nFinally, since these values need precise quantities and interrelations, which are not directly calculable from the provided percentages alone without additional data, this approach provides a framework to determine the revenue if more specific values or constraints are included."
