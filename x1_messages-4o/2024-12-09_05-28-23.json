Specifically, I am iterating over a list and I want to print out the index of the item if it matches a certain condition. The code I have so far is:\n\n```python\ntestlist = [1,2,3,5,3,1,2,1,6]\nfor item in testlist:\n    if item == 1:\n        print position\n```\nBut I am unsure of how to get and print the position of each item that meets my condition."

        "content": "To obtain the index or position of an item in a list while iterating over it, you can use the `enumerate()` function in Python. This function returns both the index and the value of each item in the list, which makes it easy to access the position of items that meet a certain condition. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\ntestlist = [1, 2, 3, 5, 3, 1, 2, 1, 6]\nfor index, item in enumerate(testlist):\n    if item == 1:\n        print(index)\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, `enumerate(testlist)` generates pairs of index and item, so you can easily check the condition and print the index of items that match your specified condition (in this case, items that are equal to `1`)."
