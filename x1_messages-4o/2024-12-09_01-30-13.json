I have a loop that sleeps for a few seconds and then fetches all unhandled data from the database. However, I am experiencing a problem where the process doesn't seem to see any new data after the first fetch, which suggests that Django is caching results. This is despite me creating new QuerySets each time. I tested this theory in a Python shell and confirmed it. I was able to resolve the issue by calling the manager's update() method, but I'm not sure what else this might affect, and there seems to be no documentation on this method. According to Django documentation, this caching behavior should not be happening. How can I prevent this caching from occurring, and why is it happening in the first place?"

        "content": "Django's ORM is designed to provide efficient database access, and it typically does not cache query results between different QuerySets. However, there are a few things to consider that might be causing the behavior you're observing:\n\n1. **Database Transaction Management**: If you are within a transaction, the data you see is determined by the isolation level of your database. By default, most databases use the \"Read Committed\" isolation level, which might not show uncommitted changes made by other transactions. Make sure you're not inadvertently starting a transaction that affects your data visibility.\n\n2. **QuerySet Reusability**: When you create a new QuerySet, it should not cache results across different instances. Ensure that you are indeed creating new QuerySets and not inadvertently reusing the same one.\n\n3. **Database Connection Issues**: If you're using a long-running process, sometimes database connections can become stale. Ensure that your database connection is being properly maintained. You might want to consider using Django's `close_old_connections()` in long-running processes to ensure the connection remains fresh.\n\n4. **QuerySet Evaluation**: Sometimes, QuerySets are evaluated and cached unexpectedly if they are being stored or passed around. Make sure you're not inadvertently evaluating a QuerySet by converting it to a list or similar operation.\n\n5. **Model Methods**: If you're calling custom model methods that internally cache results, this could lead to unexpected behavior. Ensure that any custom methods are not storing state that affects future queries.\n\n6. **Caching Middleware**: Ensure that no middleware or external caching layer is affecting your queries. Although this is less likely in a standalone process, it\u2019s worth checking your configuration.\n\nTo prevent caching or ensure fresh data on every query, you can:\n\n- Use `iterator()` on the QuerySet if you're fetching large datasets, which ensures that Django does not cache the results in memory.\n- Explicitly clear any cache you suspect might be interfering, though this is not typically needed for database query results.\n- Consider setting your database's transaction isolation level to \"Read Uncommitted\" for this specific process if it suits your use case, but be aware of the potential for reading uncommitted data (dirty reads).\n\nIf the `update()` method is resolving your issue, it might be causing a database-level refresh or re-evaluation that is not documented in Django's ORM behavior. However, it should be used with caution as it might affect data integrity or performance depending on its implementation.\n\nLastly, if none of these suggestions help, try simplifying your setup to isolate the problem. Start with a simple script outside of Django's context and gradually build up to your current setup to identify when the caching behavior begins."
