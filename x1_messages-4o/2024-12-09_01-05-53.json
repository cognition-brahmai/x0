        "content": "To check if a given string is single- or double-quoted and convert it from single-quoted to double-quoted if necessary, you can use a simple function in Python. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Check the first and last characters of the string to determine if it is single-quoted or double-quoted.\n2. If the string is single-quoted, replace the single quotes with double quotes.\n\nHere is an example function that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\ndef convert_to_double_quoted(s):\n    # Trim whitespace from the ends to ensure only the quotes are checked\n    s = s.strip()\n\n    # Check if the string is single-quoted\n    if len(s) >= 2 and s[0] == \"'\" and s[-1] == \"'\":\n        # Convert single quotes to double quotes\n        s = '\"' + s[1:-1].replace('\"', '\\\\\"') + '\"'\n    \n    return s\n\n# Example usage\nsingle_quoted_string = \"'Hello, World!'\"\ndouble_quoted_string = convert_to_double_quoted(single_quoted_string)\nprint(double_quoted_string)  # Output: \"Hello, World!\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function first trims any whitespace from the beginning and end of the string.\n- It checks if the string is at least two characters long and starts and ends with a single quote (`'`).\n- If the conditions are met, it constructs a new string starting and ending with double quotes (`\"`), replacing any internal double quotes with escaped double quotes (`\\\"`).\n- The function returns the converted string if it was single-quoted or the original string if it was already double-quoted.\n\nThis approach assumes the input string does not contain mismatched quotes and is properly formatted. If dealing with potentially malformed strings, additional checks and error handling might be necessary."
