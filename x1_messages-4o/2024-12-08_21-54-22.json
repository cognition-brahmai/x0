        "content": "To utilize an API in Swift to fetch data related to pop culture media involving animals, you can follow these steps. This example will demonstrate how to use the provided formula to retrieve data about \"The Lion King\" and \"BoJack Horseman\" using a URL session in Swift. Note that you'll need to replace `\"https://api.example.com/media\"` with the actual API endpoint you intend to use.\n\n### Step-by-step Guide\n\n1. **Create the URL:**\n\n   Combine the base URL with the query parameters to form the complete request URL.\n\n2. **Make the Network Request:**\n\n   Use `URLSession` to make an HTTP GET request to the API endpoint.\n\n3. **Parse the Response:**\n\n   Decode the JSON response into Swift structures.\n\n### Swift Code Example\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\n// Define the API URL and Query Parameters\nlet apiUrl = \"https://api.example.com/media\"\nlet queryParams = \"animals=true&media_type=movies,tv_shows&titles=The%20Lion%20King,BoJack%20Horseman\"\nlet requestUrl = \"\\(apiUrl)?\\(queryParams)\"\n\n// Function to fetch data from the API\nfunc fetchData(from url: String) {\n    guard let url = URL(string: url) else {\n        print(\"Invalid URL\")\n        return\n    }\n\n    // Create a URL session data task\n    let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { (data, response, error) in\n        // Handle error cases\n        if let error = error {\n            print(\"Error fetching data: \\(error.localizedDescription)\")\n            return\n        }\n        \n        // Ensure the data is not nil\n        guard let data = data else {\n            print(\"No data found\")\n            return\n        }\n\n        // Parse JSON data\n        do {\n            if let mediaData = try JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data, options: []) as? [String: Any] {\n                print(\"Media Data: \\(mediaData)\")\n                // Parse your specific data structure here\n            }\n        } catch {\n            print(\"Error parsing JSON: \\(error.localizedDescription)\")\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Start the task\n    task.resume()\n}\n\n// Call the function with the constructed URL\nfetchData(from: requestUrl)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **URL Construction:** The `requestUrl` is constructed by concatenating the base `apiUrl` and `queryParams`. The titles in `queryParams` are URL-encoded (e.g., spaces are replaced with `%20`).\n\n- **URLSession:** This is used to perform network operations. A data task is created to fetch data from the constructed URL.\n\n- **Error Handling:** The code checks for errors in the network request and ensures that data is received before parsing.\n\n- **JSON Parsing:** The received data is parsed into a dictionary or any other desired structure, depending on the API's response format.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **API Documentation:** Always refer to the API's documentation for specific details on how to authenticate requests, handle pagination, and understand the response format.\n\n- **Error Handling:** Enhance error handling based on your needs, such as handling HTTP status codes or specific error messages from the API.\n\n- **Concurrency:** Consider using async/await if you are targeting Swift 5.5 and above to handle asynchronous code more elegantly.\n\nBy following these steps, you can fetch and handle media data related to animals using a specified API in Swift."
