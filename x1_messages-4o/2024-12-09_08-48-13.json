        "content": "Certainly! Here's a simple Java method that determines whether a given integer is even or odd:\n\n```java\npublic class EvenOddChecker {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int number = 5; // You can change this number to test with other values\n        if (isEven(number)) {\n            System.out.println(number + \" is even.\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(number + \" is odd.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static boolean isEven(int number) {\n        return number % 2 == 0;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- The `isEven` method takes an integer `number` as its parameter.\n- It uses the modulus operator `%` to determine the remainder when `number` is divided by 2.\n- If the remainder is 0 (`number % 2 == 0`), then the number is even, and the method returns `true`.\n- If the remainder is not 0, the number is odd, and the method returns `false`.\n\nYou can test this method by changing the value of `number` in the `main` method and running the program to see the results."
