My string is 74 characters long and looks like this: \"/gifs/epic-fail-photos-there-i-fixed-it-aww-man-the-tire-pressures-low.gif\". My database only has a single column of TEXT value. I have a function where I loop through an array and try to insert each element into the database. However, I am encountering an error: \"sqlite3.ProgrammingError: Incorrect number of bindings supplied. The current statement uses 1, and there are 74 supplied\". I've tried to convert the element to a string before inserting it, but the same issue persists. Here is my code:\n\n```python\ndef insert(array):\n    connection=sqlite3.connect('images.db')\n    cursor=connection.cursor()\n    cnt=0\n    while cnt != len(array):\n        img = array[cnt]\n        print(array[cnt])\n        cursor.execute('INSERT INTO images VALUES(?)', (img))\n        cnt+= 1\n    connection.commit()\n    connection.close()\n```\n\nWhat am I doing wrong and how can I fix it?"

        "content": "The error you are encountering is due to the way you are passing the string to the `execute` method. The `execute` method expects a tuple as the second argument, but you are passing a single string without the necessary comma to convert it into a tuple.\n\nIn Python, when passing a single element to create a tuple, you need to include a trailing comma. Otherwise, it is interpreted as a sequence of characters rather than a single element tuple. Here's how you can modify your code to fix the issue:\n\n```python\ndef insert(array):\n    connection = sqlite3.connect('images.db')\n    cursor = connection.cursor()\n    cnt = 0\n    while cnt != len(array):\n        img = array[cnt]\n        print(array[cnt])\n        # Add a comma after img to create a single-element tuple\n        cursor.execute('INSERT INTO images VALUES(?)', (img,))\n        cnt += 1\n    connection.commit()\n    connection.close()\n```\n\nNotice the comma after `img` in the `execute` call: `(img,)`. This ensures that `img` is treated as a single-element tuple, which is what the `execute` method expects for placeholders in the query. This should resolve the \"Incorrect number of bindings supplied\" error you are experiencing."
