Your task must consist of at least 50 sentences, including a balanced number of each sentence type. Moreover, your task should demand not only identifying the type of sentence but also understanding the context to do so accurately. Additionally, can you include a code snippet that generates a table indicating the frequency of each sentence type and the total number of sentences in the given text? This puzzle will require multiple reasoning steps and meticulous attention to detail. Best of luck!"
