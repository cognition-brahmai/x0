However, all the files extracted from the ZIP file are read-only and not writable. I understand that I need to set the `ZipInfo.external_attr` property for each file, but I couldn't find any documentation on this. How can I set permissions or attributes on a file in a ZIP file using Python's zipfile module?"

        "content": "When you're working with the `zipfile` module in Python, the file permissions are not handled automatically as you might expect. However, you can set the file permissions using the `ZipInfo.external_attr` attribute. This attribute is a 32-bit integer, and the higher-order bits are used to store the file permissions.\n\nHere's how you can set the permissions:\n\n1. **Extracting Files:**\n   When extracting files, you might want to manually change the permissions after extraction since the `zipfile` module doesn't automatically apply the original file permissions.\n\n2. **Creating ZIP Files with Custom Permissions:**\n   When adding files to a ZIP archive, you can set the `external_attr` attribute to define the permissions.\n\nHere's an example of how you can set the permissions when adding files to a ZIP archive:\n\n```python\nimport zipfile\nimport os\n\ndef add_file_with_permissions(zip_file, file_path, arcname=None, permissions=0o755):\n    # Create a ZipInfo object\n    file_info = zipfile.ZipInfo(arcname or file_path)\n    \n    # Set the external attributes (permissions) for the file\n    file_info.external_attr = (permissions & 0xFFFF) << 16  # Shift permissions into the correct position\n    \n    # Open the file and write it to the zip\n    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:\n        zip_file.writestr(file_info, file.read())\n\n# Usage\nwith zipfile.ZipFile('example.zip', 'w') as myzip:\n    add_file_with_permissions(myzip, 'yourfile.txt', permissions=0o644)\n\n# Extracting files and setting permissions manually\nwith zipfile.ZipFile('example.zip', 'r') as myzip:\n    myzip.extractall()\n    for file in myzip.namelist():\n        os.chmod(file, 0o644)  # Adjust the permissions as needed\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`external_attr`:** The `external_attr` attribute in `ZipInfo` is where you can set the file permissions. The permissions are stored in the upper 16 bits of this attribute.\n- **Permissions Masking:** The permissions are typically set using a Unix-style permission mask, e.g., `0o755` for read, write, and execute for the owner, and read and execute for the group and others.\n- **Extracting Files:** When extracting, you might need to manually set the permissions using `os.chmod()`, as shown.\n\nThis should allow you to control the permissions of files within your ZIP archives both when creating and extracting them."
