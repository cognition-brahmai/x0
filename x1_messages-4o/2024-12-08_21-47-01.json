Since this is a complex task, I will provide you with a basic framework for each component, which you can further customize based on specific needs and preferences.\n\n### 1. Excel Table of Recommended Foods\n\nHere\u2019s a basic list of foods with their nutritional values that you can enter into Excel:\n\n| Food          | Calories (kcal) | Protein (g) | Carbs (g) | Fats (g) | Fiber (g) |\n|---------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|----------|-----------|\n| Chicken Breast| 165             | 31          | 0         | 3.6      | 0         |\n| Brown Rice    | 216             | 5           | 45        | 1.8      | 3.5       |\n| Broccoli      | 55              | 3.7         | 11        | 0.6      | 5.1       |\n| Almonds       | 576             | 21          | 22        | 49       | 12.5      |\n| Apple         | 52              | 0.3         | 14        | 0.2      | 2.4       |\n| Salmon        | 208             | 22          | 0         | 13       | 0         |\n\n### 2.
