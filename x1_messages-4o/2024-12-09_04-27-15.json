        "content": "Renaming a Django app involves several steps, and it seems like you might have missed one or more crucial parts. Here's a comprehensive guide to ensure you've covered everything:\n\n1. **Change the App Directory Name:**\n   - You've already done this, but ensure the new directory name is correct.\n\n2. **Update `INSTALLED_APPS`:**\n   - Open your `settings.py` file and update the `INSTALLED_APPS` list with the new app name.\n\n3. **Update Imports:**\n   - Ensure all import statements in your project use the new app name. This includes views, models, forms, and any other files where the app is imported.\n\n4. **Check `urls.py` Files:**\n   - If your app has a `urls.py` file, make sure that any references to the old app name are updated.\n\n5. **Update Template Paths:**\n   - If you\u2019re using the `{% extends %}`, `{% include %}`, or `{% url %}` template tags, ensure any paths or references to the old app name are updated.\n\n6. **Database Migrations:**\n   - If your app has migrations, they may contain references to the old app name. You might need to regenerate migrations after renaming the app.\n   - Alternatively, you can manually edit migration files, but proceed with caution.\n\n7. **Update `wsgi.py` and `asgi.py`:**\n   - Check these files for any references to your app and update accordingly.\n\n8. **Django Admin:**\n   - If you have registered models in the Django admin, ensure that the registration code references the new app name.\n\n9. **Static and Media Files:**\n   - If you have static or media files organized by app name, update any paths or references as necessary.\n\n10. **Check for Cached Files:**\n    - Clear any `.pyc` files or cached files that might be causing the error. You can do this by running:\n      ```bash\n      find . -name \"*.pyc\" -exec rm -f {} \\;\n      ```\n\n11. **Update any Custom Management Commands:**\n    - If you have custom management commands, check them for any hardcoded references to the old app name.\n\n12. **Virtual Environment and Path Settings:**\n    - Ensure your virtual environment is activated and that there are no issues with your Python path settings.\n\nOnce you've verified these steps, try running the server again. If the error persists:\n\n- Double-check the traceback provided by the error message to locate any missed references.\n- Use a text editor or IDE with global search functionality to find any lingering instances of the old app name throughout your project.\n\nBy systematically going through these steps, you should be able to resolve the error and successfully rename your Django app."
