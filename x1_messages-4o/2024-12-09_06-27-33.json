        "content": "I am currently developing a computer vision algorithm and I want to interactively show how a numpy array changes with each step. At the moment, when I use `imshow(array)` at the end of my code, the window displays and shows the final image. However, I want to update and display the imshow window as the image changes in each iteration. Using the provided code, the Matplotlib window doesn't activate until the entire computation is completed. I have tried both native matplotlib and pyplot with the same results. I learned about an `.ion()` switch for plotting commands but it doesn't seem to work here. What is the best way to continuously display updates to a numpy array (specifically a uint8 greyscale image)? Additionally, is it possible to do this with an animation function, like in the dynamic image example? I would like to call a function within a loop, and I'm unsure how to do this with an animation function.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport time\n\narray = np.zeros((100, 100), np.uint8)\n\nfor i in xrange(0, 100):\n    for j in xrange(0, 50):\n        array[j, i] = 1\n\n        #_show_updated_window_briefly_\n        plt.imshow(array)\n        time.sleep(0.1)\n```"

        "content": "To achieve interactive updates of your image using Matplotlib, you can utilize the interactive mode of Matplotlib along with some additional functions to ensure the plot updates correctly. The interactive mode can be activated using `plt.ion()`, and you can use `plt.pause()` to insert a short delay between updates. This way, the window will refresh and display the array as it changes in each iteration. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport time\n\n# Initialize the array\narray = np.zeros((100, 100), np.uint8)\n\n# Enable interactive mode\nplt.ion()\n\n# Create a figure and axis\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nim = ax.imshow(array, cmap='gray', vmin=0, vmax=1)\n\nfor i in range(0, 100):\n    for j in range(0, 50):\n        array[j, i] = 1\n        \n        # Update the image data\n        im.set_data(array)\n        \n        # Redraw the canvas\n        fig.canvas.draw()\n        \n        # Pause for a brief moment to update the display\n        plt.pause(0.1)\n\n# Disable interactive mode\nplt.ioff()\n\n# Keep the final plot displayed\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Interactive Mode:** `plt.ion()` enables interactive mode, which allows plots to be updated dynamically.\n2. **Creating a Figure and Axis:** `subplots()` is used to create a figure and axis object, which is necessary for updating the plot.\n3. **Updating the Image:** `im.set_data(array)` updates the data of the image displayed.\n4. **Redrawing the Canvas:** `fig.canvas.draw()` is needed to render the updated plot.\n5. **Pause:** `plt.pause(0.1)` ensures that the plot updates by introducing a small delay, allowing the GUI event loop to process.\n\nThis setup will show the numpy array updating interactively in the Matplotlib window. You can adjust the `pause` duration for faster or slower updates based on your needs."
