        "content": "The `PYTHONPATH` environment variable is used to specify additional directories where Python should look for modules and packages. When you modify `sys.path` using `sys.path.insert()` or similar methods, you are altering the module search path for the current Python runtime session, but this does not affect the environment variable `PYTHONPATH` directly.\n\nIf you encounter a `KeyError` when trying to access `os.environ['PYTHONPATH']`, it means that `PYTHONPATH` is not set in your environment variables. This is not unusual, as `PYTHONPATH` is optional and not always necessary to set explicitly.\n\nHere's how you can check and print the contents of the `sys.path`, which represents the current search path for modules in your Python session (including any modifications you've made):\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Print the current sys.path\nfor path in sys.path:\n    print(path)\n```\n\nThis will print all directories in the current Python module search path, including any you have added using `sys.path.insert()`.\n\nIf you specifically want to see if `PYTHONPATH` is set in your environment before starting Python, you can check it using a terminal or command prompt with the following command:\n\n- On macOS/Linux:\n  ```sh\n  echo $PYTHONPATH\n  ```\n\n- On Windows:\n  ```cmd\n  echo %PYTHONPATH%\n  ```\n\nIf `PYTHONPATH` is not set, these commands will return an empty line. You can set `PYTHONPATH` in your environment if desired, but remember that `sys.path` modifications are session-specific and do not influence the environment variable directly."
