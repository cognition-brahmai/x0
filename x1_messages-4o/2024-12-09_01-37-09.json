I have a dataframe like this:\n\n```python\ndf = pandas.DataFrame([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]], columns=['a','b','c'])\n```\nIt looks like this:\n```python\n   a  b  c\n0  1  2  3\n1  4  5  6\n```\nI have a function that accesses elements with a given row:\n```python\ndef rowFunc(row):\n    return row['a'] + row['b'] * row['c']\n```\nI can apply it like this:\n```python\ndf['d'] = df.apply(rowFunc, axis=1)\n```\nAnd the DataFrame looks like this after adding column 'd':\n```python\n   a  b  c   d\n0  1  2  3   7\n1  4  5  6  34\n```\nNow, I want to incorporate the index into my function. The index of any given row in this DataFrame before adding 'd' would be Index([u'a', u'b', u'c', u'd'], dtype='object'), but I want the 0 and 1. So, I can't just access row.index. I know I could create a temporary column in the table where I store the index, but I'm wondering if it is stored in the row object somewhere?"

        "content": "To access the index of a row within a function applied to a DataFrame in Pandas, you can use the `name` attribute of the row. This attribute holds the index label for the row, which is what you're looking for.\n\nHere's how you can modify your function to incorporate the index:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Your DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], columns=['a', 'b', 'c'])\n\n# Define the function that uses the row index\ndef rowFunc(row):\n    # Access the index of the row using row.name\n    index = row.name\n    return row['a'] + row['b'] * row['c'] + index  # Example usage of index\n\n# Apply the function to the DataFrame\ndf['d'] = df.apply(rowFunc, axis=1)\n\n# Display the DataFrame\nprint(df)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `rowFunc` function now includes the row index in its calculation. The `row.name` attribute provides the index of the row, allowing you to use it as needed in your computations. The resulting DataFrame will look like this:\n\n```\n   a  b  c   d\n0  1  2  3   7\n1  4  5  6  35\n```\n\nNote that in this example, I've added the index to the calculation just to demonstrate its use. You can adjust the function to use the index in any way that suits your needs."
