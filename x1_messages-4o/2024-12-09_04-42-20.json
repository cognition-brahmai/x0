According to the Torch documentation, I should use the following command to install the latest version of PyTorch: \n```pip install torch==1.4.0+cpu torchvision==0.5.0+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html```\nThis command works when I execute it manually, but when I add it to my requirements.txt file and try to install it using the command `pip install -r req.txt`, I encounter an error that says `ERROR: No matching distribution`. Here is the line from my requirements.txt file and the error:\n```\ntorch==1.4.0+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html\ntorchvision==0.5.0+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.htmltorch==1.4.0+cpu\n```\nAnd the error message:\n```\nERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement torch==1.4.0+cpu (from -r requirements.txt (line 1)) (from versions: 0.1.2, 0.1.2.post1, 0.1.2.post2, 0.3.1, 0.4.0, 0.4.1, 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.1.post2, 1.1.0, 1.2.0, 1.3.0, 1.3.1, 1.4.0)\nERROR: No matching distribution found for torch==1.4.0+cpu (from -r requirements.txt (line 1))\n```\nHow can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "To resolve the issue of installing PyTorch from a `requirements.txt` file, you need to correctly format the file to ensure that the additional URL for the package index is applied. The `-f` flag for specifying a package index URL should be placed outside of the package specification. Here's how you can structure your `requirements.txt` file to fix the error:\n\n1. Place the `-f` option on a separate line before the package specifications, as it applies to all subsequent packages in the file.\n\n2. Remove any duplicate or incorrect package specifications.\n\nYour `requirements.txt` file should look like this:\n\n```\n-f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html\ntorch==1.4.0+cpu\ntorchvision==0.5.0+cpu\n```\n\nNow, when you run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, it should correctly use the additional package index URL to find and install the specified versions of PyTorch and torchvision.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what each line does:\n\n- The `-f` line specifies the URL where `pip` should look for the wheel files.\n- The lines for `torch` and `torchvision` specify the exact versions to install, using the additional index URL defined above.\n\nBy structuring your `requirements.txt` file this way, you ensure that `pip` can find the special builds of PyTorch and torchvision that you need."
