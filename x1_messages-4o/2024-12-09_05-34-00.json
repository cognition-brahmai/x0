I understand that this process needs to be chunked and looped through but I am unsure how to set the batches to start where the previous left off. Is there a method to filter my scan? I have read that filtering occurs after loading and the loading stops at 1mb so I wouldn't actually be able to scan in new objects. Here is my current code:\n\n```python\nimport boto3\ndynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb',\n    aws_session_token = aws_session_token,\n    aws_access_key_id = aws_access_key_id,\n    aws_secret_access_key = aws_secret_access_key,\n    region_name = region\n    )\n\ntable = dynamodb.Table('widgetsTableName')\n\ndata = table.scan()\n```\n\nAny guidance on how to accomplish this would be appreciated."

        "content": "To efficiently pull all the data from a DynamoDB table using Boto3, you'll want to handle pagination, as DynamoDB's `scan` operation returns a maximum of 1 MB of data per request. If the data exceeds this limit, you'll need to continue scanning until all data is retrieved. Here's how you can modify your code to handle pagination using the `ExclusiveStartKey` parameter:\n\n```python\nimport boto3\n\n# Initialize the DynamoDB resource\ndynamodb = boto3.resource(\n    'dynamodb',\n    aws_session_token=aws_session_token,\n    aws_access_key_id=aws_access_key_id,\n    aws_secret_access_key=aws_secret_access_key,\n    region_name=region\n)\n\n# Define the table\ntable = dynamodb.Table('widgetsTableName')\n\n# Initialize variables for pagination\nresponse = None\ndata = []\n\n# Loop through paginated results\nwhile True:\n    if response:\n        # Use the ExclusiveStartKey to continue where the previous scan left off\n        response = table.scan(ExclusiveStartKey=response['LastEvaluatedKey'])\n    else:\n        # Initial scan\n        response = table.scan()\n    \n    # Add the items from this scan to the data list\n    data.extend(response['Items'])\n    \n    # Check if there's more data to fetch\n    if 'LastEvaluatedKey' not in response:\n        break\n\n# Now `data` contains all the items from the table\nprint(f\"Retrieved {len(data)} items.\")\n\n# Process the data as needed\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Pagination**: The `scan()` method can return up to 1 MB of data, so you need to continue scanning until all items are retrieved. This is done using the `LastEvaluatedKey` to keep track of the last scanned item.\n\n2. **ExclusiveStartKey**: This parameter tells DynamoDB where to start the next scan operation. It uses the key of the last evaluated item from the previous scan.\n\n3. **Efficient Scanning**: The scan operation can be resource-intensive, as it examines every item in the table. If possible, consider using queries with a primary key or using filters to narrow down the dataset.\n\nRemember that scanning large tables can be costly and slow, especially with large datasets. Optimize your data retrieval strategy to suit your needs and consider using parallel scans or data partitioning if applicable."
