I was wondering if I need to manually close the connection once I am done with reading the data. Or is there a need to use a \"with\" statement in this context? Here is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\nimport pandas as pd\n\nsql = \"\"\"\n    SELECT * FROM Table_Name;\n    \"\"\"\nengine = create_engine('blah')\n\ndf = pd.read_sql_query(sql, engine)\n\nprint df.head()\n```"

        "content": "When using SQLAlchemy's `create_engine` with Pandas' `read_sql_query`, it's generally a good practice to manage the connection lifecycle to ensure that resources are properly released. SQLAlchemy's `create_engine` function returns an `Engine` object, which is a factory for connections to the database. However, it does not inherently manage the connections for you beyond creating them.\n\nIn your current setup, the connection is automatically established when you execute `pd.read_sql_query`, and it's usually automatically closed after the query execution. However, if you want to ensure that the connection is explicitly closed, you can use a context manager (`with` statement) to handle it more gracefully. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\nimport pandas as pd\n\nsql = \"\"\"\n    SELECT * FROM Table_Name;\n    \"\"\"\nengine = create_engine('blah')\n\n# Use the engine to create a connection with a context manager\nwith engine.connect() as connection:\n    df = pd.read_sql_query(sql, connection)\n\nprint(df.head())\n```\n\nUsing a `with` statement ensures that the connection is closed as soon as the block of code is exited, even if an error occurs. This is a cleaner and more robust approach to managing database connections, especially in applications that maintain long-running processes or when dealing with multiple queries."
