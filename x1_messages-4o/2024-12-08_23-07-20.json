Here are five questions that could be effective in assessing candidates for a customer service position:\n\n1. **Can you describe a time when you turned an unhappy customer into a satisfied one? What steps did you take to resolve their issue?**\n\n2. **How do you prioritize tasks when dealing with multiple customer queries at once?**\n\n3. **What strategies do you use to handle a difficult or irate customer? Can you give an example of a particularly challenging situation and how you managed it?**\n\n4. **How do you ensure you stay informed about the products or services you're supporting, and how do you use this knowledge to benefit customer interactions?**\n\n5. **Tell us about a time you went above and beyond for a customer. What was the situation, and what was the outcome?**\n\nThese questions are designed to gauge the candidate\u2019s problem-solving skills, ability to prioritize, emotional intelligence, product knowledge, and dedication to customer satisfaction."
