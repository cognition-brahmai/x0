Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Import the Module**: You need to import the module whose path you want to retrieve.\n\n2. **Access the `__file__` Attribute**: Once the module is imported, you can access the `__file__` attribute to get the path.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport some_module  # replace 'some_module' with the actual module name\n\n# Get the path of the module\nmodule_path = os.path.abspath(some_module.__file__)\n\nprint(\"Module path:\", module_path)\n```\n\nThis script will output the absolute path to the module file. You can then use this path to set up inotify to monitor changes in this directory.\n\n**Note**: If the module is a built-in module (written in C and compiled into the Python interpreter), it may not have a `__file__` attribute. In such cases, you will need to use other methods to track changes, as these modules are not represented as files on the filesystem."
