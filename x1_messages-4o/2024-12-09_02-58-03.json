I have a pipeline that includes the procedures 'enn' and 'renn' and I want to make sure these are not executed when predicting. I understand that over-, under-, and mixed-sampling procedures are only applied to the training set. I have looked over the imblearn Pipeline code, but I couldn't find the 'predict' method. Also, I want to be certain that the correct behavior is maintained when the pipeline is inside a GridSearchCV. Can anyone confirm this behavior in imblearn.Pipeline? \n\nAdditionally, I would like to understand why one should use the imblearn.Pipeline for imbalanced pre-processing and not sklearn.Pipeline. I could not find an explanation for this in the imblearn documentation.\n\nMy code is as follows:\n\n```\n# Instanciate a PCA object for the sake of easy visualisation\npca = PCA(n_components=2)\n\n# Create the samplers\nenn = EditedNearestNeighbours()\nrenn = RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours()\n\n# Create the classifier\nknn = KNN(1)\n\n# Make the splits\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = tts(X, y, random_state=42)\n\n# Add one transformers and two samplers in the pipeline object\npipeline = make_pipeline(pca, enn, renn, knn)\n\npipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)\ny_hat = pipeline.predict(X_test)\n```"

        "content": "Yes, the `imblearn.Pipeline` is designed to behave as you described. When you use an `imblearn.Pipeline`, the sampling steps such as Edited Nearest Neighbors (ENN) and Repeated Edited Nearest Neighbors (RENN) are only applied during the `fit` process on the training data. They are not applied during the `predict` stage on the test data. This behavior ensures that the test data remains unbiased and is evaluated against the model built from the resampled training data.\n\n### Explanation of Behavior:\n\n1. **Training (`fit` method)**: \n   - During the `fit` call, the pipeline executes the defined sampling strategies like `enn` and `renn` on the training data to handle class imbalances. This step adjusts the training data to improve model performance on imbalanced datasets.\n\n2. **Prediction (`predict` method)**:\n   - The `predict` method does not apply any sampling methods. It simply uses the model trained on the resampled data to make predictions on the test set.\n\n### GridSearchCV Compatibility:\n\nWhen using `GridSearchCV` with an `imblearn.Pipeline`, the resampling techniques are also only applied during the fitting of each fold in the cross-validation process. This ensures that each fold is appropriately balanced, but the test set remains untouched by these samplers.\n\n### Why Use `imblearn.Pipeline` over `sklearn.Pipeline`:\n\n`imblearn.Pipeline` is specifically designed to handle situations where resampling methods are part of the pipeline. While `sklearn.Pipeline` can handle standard preprocessing and modeling steps, it does not natively support resampling methods as part of the pipeline, which are crucial for dealing with imbalanced datasets. `imblearn.Pipeline` extends `sklearn.Pipeline` capabilities to include these imbalanced learn techniques, thereby providing a more integrated and efficient workflow for imbalance handling.\n\n### Code Explanation:\n\nYour code snippet is correctly using `imblearn.make_pipeline` to combine PCA, ENN, RENN, and KNN into one pipeline. This setup ensures that the resampling strategies are applied only during training, while the PCA transformation and the KNN classifier are applied during both training and prediction.\n\n```python\n# Instantiate a PCA object for easy visualization\npca = PCA(n_components=2)\n\n# Create the samplers\nenn = EditedNearestNeighbours()\nrenn = RepeatedEditedNearestNeighbours()\n\n# Create the classifier\nknn = KNN(1)\n\n# Make the splits\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = tts(X, y, random_state=42)\n\n# Add one transformer and two samplers in the pipeline object\npipeline = make_pipeline(pca, enn, renn, knn)\n\npipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)\ny_hat = pipeline.predict(X_test)\n```\n\nThis pipeline efficiently handles class imbalances during training while keeping the prediction phase straightforward and unbiased."
