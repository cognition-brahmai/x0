According to the <a href=\"http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">SciPy documentation</a>, it is possible to minimize functions with multiple variables but I am unsure how to implement this. Here's the code snippet I am working with:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\nfrom math import *\n\ndef f(c):\n  return sqrt((sin(pi/2) + sin(0) + sin(c) - 2)**2 + (cos(pi/2) + cos(0) + cos(c) - 1)**2)\n\nprint(minimize(f, 3.14/2 + 3.14/7))\n```\n\nThis code minimizes the function `f` with respect to one variable. However, I need to minimize it with respect to three variables. Simply introducing a second argument and adjusting `minimize` accordingly yields an error (`TypeError: f() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)`). How does `minimize` work when minimizing with multiple variables?"

        "content": "To use `scipy.optimize.minimize` for a function with multiple variables, you'll need to modify your function to accept a single argument that is a list or array containing all the variables. The `minimize` function will then pass this list/array to your function. Let's go through how you can adjust your code to handle multiple variables.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify your code to minimize a function with respect to three variables:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\nfrom math import sqrt, sin, cos, pi\n\n# Define the function to minimize with a single parameter that is an array of variables\ndef f(c):\n    # c is an array-like structure containing [c1, c2, c3]\n    c1, c2, c3 = c\n    return sqrt((sin(pi/2) + sin(c1) + sin(c2) + sin(c3) - 2)**2 + \n                (cos(pi/2) + cos(c1) + cos(c2) + cos(c3) - 1)**2)\n\n# Initial guesses for the variables\ninitial_guess = [pi/2 + pi/7, pi/3, pi/4]\n\n# Call the minimize function with the initial guess\nresult = minimize(f, initial_guess)\n\n# Print the optimization result\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Key points:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `f` should take a single argument `c`, which is a list or array of all the variables involved in your optimization problem. In this case, `c` is `[c1, c2, c3]`.\n\n2. **Initial Guess**: Provide an initial guess for each of the variables. This should match the number of variables in your problem. Here, `initial_guess` is set to a list `[pi/2 + pi/7, pi/3, pi/4]`.\n\n3. **Calling `minimize`**: Pass the function `f` and the initial guess to `minimize`. The function returns an optimization `result` object, which contains information about the solution, including the optimized variables, success status, and more.\n\nThis setup allows `scipy.optimize.minimize` to adjust all variables simultaneously to find the minimum of the function. Adjust the initial guesses and function definition as needed for your specific problem."
