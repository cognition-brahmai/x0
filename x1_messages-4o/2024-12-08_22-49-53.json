Can you provide a Scala code that not only removes the specific elements from the List but also arranges the remaining elements in descending order? And to make it even more interesting, can you implement this in a way that only uses higher-order functions such as map, filter, and reduce? Let's see if you can crack this puzzle!"

        "content": "Sure! Here's a Scala code snippet that solves your puzzle by using higher-order functions such as `filter`, `map`, and `sortWith` to remove specific elements from a list and then arrange the remaining elements in descending order:\n\n```scala\nobject ListPuzzle extends App {\n  def processLists(originalList: List[Int], toRemoveList: List[Int]): List[Int] = {\n    // Step 1: Remove elements present in the toRemoveList\n    val filteredList = originalList.filterNot(toRemoveList.contains)\n\n    // Step 2: Sort the filtered list in descending order\n    val sortedList = filteredList.sortWith(_ > _)\n\n    sortedList\n  }\n\n  val originalList = List(10, 3, 5, 7, 2, 8, 1, 9)\n  val toRemoveList = List(3, 7, 2)\n\n  val result = processLists(originalList, toRemoveList)\n  println(result) // Output will be: List(10, 9, 8, 5, 1)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **filterNot**: This higher-order function is used to create a new list that excludes elements present in `toRemoveList`.\n\n2. **sortWith**: This function sorts the remaining elements in descending order by comparing them with the `> operator`.\n\nThis code effectively uses only higher-order functions to achieve the desired outcome. You can run this code in a Scala environment to see the results. Enjoy solving the puzzle!"
