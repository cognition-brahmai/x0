I can't find anything about this in the Python documentation. Do I have to use `number = number + 1`? Don't people use the `++` / `--` notation in Python?"

Instead, to increment an integer value, you indeed use the expression `number = number + 1` or the shorthand `number += 1`.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\nnumber = 5\nnumber += 1  # This increments the value of number by 1\nprint(number)  # Output will be 6\n```\n\nPython's design philosophy emphasizes readability and simplicity, and as such, it doesn't include these operators. The `+=` operator is a more idiomatic way to increment a number in Python. Similarly, to decrement a number, you would use `number -= 1`."
