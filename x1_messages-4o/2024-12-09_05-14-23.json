        "content": "The error message you're encountering is related to the fact that the NumPy array you're trying to pass as a context variable in Django is not directly serializable to JSON. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a format commonly used for data interchange, and it can only serialize standard Python data types like lists, dictionaries, strings, numbers, etc.\n\nNumPy arrays, however, are not one of these standard types, which is why you're seeing this error. To resolve this, you need to convert the NumPy array into a data type that is JSON serializable, such as a Python list.\n\nHere's how you can do that:\n\n1. **Convert the NumPy Array to a List**:\n   Before passing your NumPy array to the Django context, convert it to a list.\n\n   ```python\n   import numpy as np\n\n   # Your original NumPy array\n   numpy_array = np.array([0, 239, 479, 717, 952, 1192, 1432, 1667], dtype=np.int64)\n\n   # Convert the NumPy array to a list\n   array_as_list = numpy_array.tolist()\n   ```\n\n2. **Pass the List to the Django Context**:\n   Now you can pass the `array_as_list` to the Django context, and it should be JSON serializable.\n\n   ```python\n   # In your Django view\n   context = {\n       'my_array': array_as_list,\n   }\n\n   return render(request, 'your_template.html', context)\n   ```\n\nBy converting the NumPy array into a list using the `.tolist()` method, you ensure that the data can be properly serialized to JSON and passed to your webpage without errors."
