I tried using the code below:\n\n```python\ndf_all = df_all.dropna()\ndf_all.reset_index(drop=True)\n```\nHowever, after dropping rows, the index skips numbers. For example it would jump from 0, 1, 2 to 4."

        "content": "When you use the `reset_index` method on a pandas DataFrame, it returns a new DataFrame with the index reset. If you don't assign this back to your DataFrame, the original DataFrame will remain unchanged. In your case, you should assign the result back to `df_all` like this:\n\n```python\ndf_all = df_all.dropna()\ndf_all = df_all.reset_index(drop=True)\n```\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. `df_all.dropna()` removes the rows with missing values but doesn't modify the original DataFrame in place. It returns a new DataFrame with the rows dropped.\n\n2. `df_all.reset_index(drop=True)` creates a new DataFrame with the index reset, but again, it doesn't modify the original DataFrame in place unless you assign the result back to `df_all`.\n\nBy reassigning the result of `reset_index` back to `df_all`, you'll have a DataFrame with a continuous index starting from 0."
