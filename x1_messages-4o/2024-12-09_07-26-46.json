According to the reportlab documentation, I should be able to use the following code to set the color:\n```\nself.canvas.setFillColorRGB(255,0,0)\nself.canvas.drawCentredString(...)\n```\nHowever, this doesn't seem to work. The text color remains black regardless of the RGB values I provide to the `setFillColorRGB` method. How can I successfully change the text color?"

        "content": "It looks like you're on the right track, but there's a small issue with the way you're using the `setFillColorRGB` method. The `setFillColorRGB` method in ReportLab expects the color values to be in the range of 0 to 1, not 0 to 255. So instead of using `255, 0, 0` for red, you should use `1, 0, 0`.\n\nHere's how you can adjust your code:\n\n```python\nself.canvas.setFillColorRGB(1, 0, 0)  # Set the color to red\nself.canvas.drawCentredString(...)\n```\n\nIf you want to convert from the typical 0-255 RGB values to the 0-1 range that ReportLab uses, you can divide each component by 255:\n\n```python\nred = 255 / 255.0\ngreen = 0 / 255.0\nblue = 0 / 255.0\n\nself.canvas.setFillColorRGB(red, green, blue)\nself.canvas.drawCentredString(...)\n```\n\nThis should work to change the text color in your PDF. If you continue to encounter issues, make sure that there are no other parts of the code that might be resetting the color after you set it."
