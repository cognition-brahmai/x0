Can you provide examples of useful imports or definitions that can make Python 2.x look and behave more like Python 3.x? Assume that we are using the latest Python 2.x version (2.7.2)."

        "content": "Making your Python 2.x code compatible with Python 3.x involves several steps. Here are some strategies and resources you can use to ease the transition:\n\n### 1. Use `__future__` Imports\n\nPython 2.7 provides several `__future__` imports that bring some Python 3.x features into Python 2.x. Here are some commonly used ones:\n\n- **`print_function`**: Makes the `print` statement a function.\n  ```python\n  from __future__ import print_function\n  print(\"Hello, world!\")\n  ```\n\n- **`division`**: Changes the division operator to perform true division (like Python 3).\n  ```python\n  from __future__ import division\n  print(5 / 2)  # Outputs 2.5\n  ```\n\n- **`unicode_literals`**: Makes string literals Unicode by default.\n  ```python\n  from __future__ import unicode_literals\n  print(type('hello'))  # Outputs <type 'unicode'>\n  ```\n\n- **`absolute_import`**: Changes the import behavior to be absolute by default.\n  ```python\n  from __future__ import absolute_import\n  ```\n\n### 2. Use `six` or `future` Libraries\n\nThese libraries provide compatibility layers for writing code that works on both Python 2 and 3.\n\n- **`six`**: A lightweight library that provides utilities for writing code compatible with both Python 2 and 3.\n  ```python\n  import six\n  if six.PY3:\n      pass  # Python 3 specific code\n  else:\n      pass  # Python 2 specific code\n  ```\n\n- **`future`**: Allows you to use Python 3.x style code in Python 2.x.\n  ```bash\n  pip install future\n  ```\n  Example usage:\n  ```python\n  from future import standard_library\n  standard_library.install_aliases()\n  ```\n\n### 3. Use the `2to3` Tool\n\n`2to3` is a tool that can automatically convert Python 2 code to Python 3. While it may not handle every case, it\u2019s a good starting point.\n\n```bash\n2to3 -w your_script.py\n```\n\n### 4. Write Code in a Python 3 Style\n\n- Use `new-style` classes by inheriting from `object`.\n  ```python\n  class MyClass(object):\n      pass\n  ```\n\n- Use dictionary and set comprehensions where appropriate.\n\n- Prefer `format()` method for string formatting.\n\n### 5. Be Mindful of Changes in Built-in Functions and Libraries\n\n- **Iterators**: In Python 3, functions like `range()` and `map()` return iterators. Use `list()` to convert them if necessary.\n  ```python\n  for i in list(range(10)):\n      print(i)\n  ```\n\n- **Relative Imports**: Use explicit relative imports.\n\n### Resources\n\n- **Python's Official Porting Guide**: [Python Porting Guide](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html)\n- **Six Documentation**: [Six Documentation](https://six.readthedocs.io/)\n- **Future Documentation**: [Future Documentation](http://python-future.org/)\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can make your Python 2.x code more compatible with Python 3.x and ensure a smoother transition when you decide to upgrade."
