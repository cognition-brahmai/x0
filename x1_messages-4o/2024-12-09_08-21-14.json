The error trace is as follows:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gevent-1.0b2-py2.7-linux-x86_64.egg/gevent/greenlet.py\", line 328, in run\n    result = self._run(*self.args, **self.kwargs)\n  File \"/home/ubuntu/workspace/bitmagister-api/mab.py\", line 117, in mabLoop\n    output = json.dump(fu)\nTypeError: dump() takes at least 2 arguments (1 given)\n&lt;Greenlet at 0x7f4f3d6eec30: mabLoop&gt; failed with TypeError\n```\n\nWhat am I missing here?"

        "content": "In Python 2.7, the `json.dump()` function is used to serialize a Python object and write it directly to a file-like object (e.g., a file). It requires at least two arguments: the object to serialize and the file-like object where the serialized data will be written.\n\nIf you want to convert a dictionary to a JSON string, you should use `json.dumps()` (with an \"s\" at the end), which returns the JSON string representation of the dictionary. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport json\nfu = {'a': 'b'}\noutput = json.dumps(fu)\nprint(output)  # This will output: {\"a\": \"b\"}\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, `json.dumps()` takes only one argument, which is the Python object you want to serialize into a JSON string."
