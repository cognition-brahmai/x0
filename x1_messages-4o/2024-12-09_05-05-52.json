Currently, in my Django project, I am using the following code:\n\n```python\nif not 'thing_for_purpose' in request.session:\n    request.session['thing_for_purpose'] = 5\n```\nHowever, I find this method quite awkward. In Ruby, it would simply be:\n```ruby\nrequest.session['thing_for_purpose'] ||= 5\n```\nIs there a more succinct way to achieve this in Python?"

This method sets a default value if the key is not already in the dictionary, which is exactly what you want in this case. Here is how you can refactor your code using `setdefault`:\n\n```python\nrequest.session.setdefault('thing_for_purpose', 5)\n```\n\nThis single line of code checks if `'thing_for_purpose'` is a key in `request.session`. If it is not, it sets the key to the value `5`. If the key already exists, it leaves the current value unchanged. This approach is clean and idiomatic in Python, similar to the Ruby `||=` operator."
