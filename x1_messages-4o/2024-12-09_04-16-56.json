I'm looking for a mature Python library that can provide an interface similar to the os.* modules for working with these remote files. I've done some research and found several options for WebDAV in Python, but I'm unsure which ones are more popular currently. Can anyone recommend a widely used Python client library for WebDAV?"

        "content": "For implementing WebDAV functionality in your application using Python, there are a few libraries that you might find useful. Here are some of the more popular and mature options:\n\n1. **requests-toolbelt**: While not specifically a WebDAV client, `requests-toolbelt` can be used in conjunction with the popular `requests` library to handle HTTP-based protocols, including WebDAV. You can manually construct WebDAV requests using this combination.\n\n2. **wsgidav**: This library provides a WSGI middleware for integrating WebDAV into Python web applications. It's more focused on being a WebDAV server, but it can be adapted for client-side operations as well.\n\n3. **webdavclient3**: This is a Python library that provides a simple interface for interacting with WebDAV servers. It is actively maintained and offers functionalities similar to file operations you might perform with the `os` module.\n\n4. **easywebdav**: This is another simple WebDAV client for Python. It aims to provide a straightforward interface for common operations like uploading, downloading, and deleting files.\n\n5. **PyWebDAV3**: This is a fork of the original PyWebDAV, updated for Python 3. It provides both client and server implementations, allowing you to interact with WebDAV resources.\n\nAmong these, `webdavclient3` and `easywebdav` are quite popular for client-side operations. They are relatively easy to use and provide methods similar to those found in the `os` module, making them suitable for your needs.\n\nWhen choosing a library, consider the specific features you need, such as authentication methods, support for large files, and ease of integration with your existing codebase. It's also a good idea to check the documentation and community support for the library you choose."
