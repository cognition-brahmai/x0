        "content": "Certainly! To perform multi-class classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM) in MATLAB, you can follow this example. MATLAB has a built-in `fitcecoc` function which is used for multi-class SVM classification, as it automatically handles the multi-class problem by using the Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) model.\n\nHere's an example using your provided dataset format:\n\n```matlab\n% Sample data\ndata = [\n    1 2 3 4 0;\n    1 2 3 5 0;\n    0 2 6 4 1;\n    0 3 3 8 1;\n    7 2 6 4 2;\n    9 1 7 10 3\n];\n\n% Separate features and labels\nX = data(:, 1:4); % Attributes (features)\nY = data(:, 5);   % Classes (labels)\n\n% Train the SVM model using ECOC (Error-Correcting Output Codes)\nSVMModel = fitcecoc(X, Y);\n\n% Predict using the trained model\n% For demonstration, let's predict the classes of the training data\npredictedLabels = predict(SVMModel, X);\n\n% Display the predicted labels\ndisp('Predicted Labels:');\ndisp(predictedLabels);\n\n% Evaluate the accuracy\naccuracy = sum(predictedLabels == Y) / length(Y) * 100;\nfprintf('Training Accuracy: %.2f%%\\n', accuracy);\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Data Preparation**: First, the data is separated into features (`X`) and labels (`Y`).\n- **Model Training**: We use `fitcecoc` to train an ECOC model with SVM learners, which is suitable for multi-class classification problems.\n- **Prediction**: Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict the classes of new data or the same training data as shown.\n- **Accuracy Evaluation**: The example calculates the accuracy of the predictions on the training data.\n\nThis script should give you a basic framework to perform multi-class classification using SVM in MATLAB. You can expand it by splitting your data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data, or by tuning the SVM parameters to improve performance."
