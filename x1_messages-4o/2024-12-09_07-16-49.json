I know that widgets like Button, Entry, and Text can have borders. However, when I try to add the border to the Label widget by setting `highlightthickness=4`, `highlightcolor=\"black\"`, `highlightbackground=\"black\"`, `borderwidth=4` within the widget, it doesn't work. Is it possible to add a border to a Label widget in tkinter? Here's my current code:\n\n```python\nfrom tkinter import *\n\nroot = Tk()\n\nL1 = Label(root, text=\"This\")\nL2 = Label(root, text=\"That\")\n\nL1.pack()\nL2.pack()\n```"

        "content": "In Tkinter, the `Label` widget does not support the `highlightthickness`, `highlightcolor`, or `highlightbackground` options like some other widgets. However, you can achieve a similar effect by using the `borderwidth` and `relief` options. Here's how you can add a border to a `Label` widget:\n\n```python\nfrom tkinter import *\n\nroot = Tk()\n\nL1 = Label(root, text=\"This\", borderwidth=4, relief=\"solid\")\nL2 = Label(root, text=\"That\", borderwidth=4, relief=\"solid\")\n\nL1.pack(pady=10, padx=10)  # Added padding for better visibility\nL2.pack(pady=10, padx=10)\n\nroot.mainloop()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`borderwidth=4`:** This sets the width of the border around the Label.\n- **`relief=\"solid\"`:** This sets the style of the border. Other options for `relief` include `flat`, `raised`, `sunken`, `ridge`, and `groove`.\n\nBy setting `relief` to `\"solid\"`, you get a simple solid border around the label, which should enhance its appearance. You can adjust `borderwidth` and `relief` to achieve the desired look for your calendar project."
