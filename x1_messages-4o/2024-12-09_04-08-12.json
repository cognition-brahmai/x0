The same issue also occurs when I attempt to set other parameters like 'random_state'. I'm currently using the latest version of xgboost (0.6a2) that I installed using pip. Here's the code I'm using to reproduce the error:\n\n<pre><code>\nfrom xgboost import XGBClassifier \nestimator_xGBM = XGBClassifier(max_depth = 5, learning_rate = 0.05, n_estimators = 400, n_jobs = -1).fit(x_train)\n</code></pre>\n\nI'm not sure what the problem might be. Any ideas on how to resolve this issue?"

        "content": "It looks like you're using an older version of XGBoost. The version `0.6a2` is quite outdated, and the `n_jobs` parameter was not available in that version. The `n_jobs` parameter, along with other enhancements, was introduced in later versions of XGBoost.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Update XGBoost**: You need to update your XGBoost package to a newer version where the `n_jobs` parameter is supported. You can do this via pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade xgboost\n   ```\n\n   This will install the latest stable version of XGBoost where parameters like `n_jobs` and `random_state` are available in the `XGBClassifier`.\n\n2. **Verify Installation**: After upgrading, you can verify the installation and check the version:\n\n   ```python\n   import xgboost as xgb\n   print(xgb.__version__)\n   ```\n\n   Ensure it prints a version that is greater than `0.6a2`.\n\n3. **Modify Your Code**: Once you have upgraded, your code should work without any issues:\n\n   ```python\n   from xgboost import XGBClassifier \n   estimator_xGBM = XGBClassifier(max_depth=5, learning_rate=0.05, n_estimators=400, n_jobs=-1, random_state=42)\n   estimator_xGBM.fit(x_train, y_train)\n   ```\n\n   Ensure that you include both `x_train` and `y_train` in the `fit` method as `fit` requires both features and target variables.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to use the `n_jobs` parameter for parallel threading and other modern features of XGBoost."
