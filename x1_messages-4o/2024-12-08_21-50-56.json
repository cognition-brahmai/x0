The sequence given is a Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n- 2 and 3 are the first two numbers.\n- 5 is 2 + 3.\n- 8 is 3 + 5.\n- 13 is 5 + 8.\n\nThe next number should be the sum of 8 and 13, which is 21.\n\nNow, let's ensure that the sum of all the numbers before this missing number (21) is odd:\n\n- Sum of numbers before 21: 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 + 13 = 31\n\n31 is indeed an odd number.\n\nTherefore, the missing number in the sequence is 21."
