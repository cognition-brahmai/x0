        "content": "Implementing AES encryption in C# is a great way to secure sensitive data at rest. Here's a simple example of how you can implement AES encryption:\n\n### AES Encryption in C#\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.IO;\nusing System.Security.Cryptography;\nusing System.Text;\n\npublic class AesEncryption\n{\n    public static (byte[], byte[], byte[]) Encrypt(string plainText, byte[] key, byte[] iv)\n    {\n        using (Aes aesAlg = Aes.Create())\n        {\n            aesAlg.Key = key;\n            aesAlg.IV = iv;\n\n            ICryptoTransform encryptor = aesAlg.CreateEncryptor(aesAlg.Key, aesAlg.IV);\n\n            using (MemoryStream msEncrypt = new MemoryStream())\n            {\n                using (CryptoStream csEncrypt = new CryptoStream(msEncrypt, encryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Write))\n                {\n                    using (StreamWriter swEncrypt = new StreamWriter(csEncrypt))\n                    {\n                        swEncrypt.Write(plainText);\n                    }\n                    return (msEncrypt.ToArray(), aesAlg.Key, aesAlg.IV);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static string Decrypt(byte[] cipherText, byte[] key, byte[] iv)\n    {\n        using (Aes aesAlg = Aes.Create())\n        {\n            aesAlg.Key = key;\n            aesAlg.IV = iv;\n\n            ICryptoTransform decryptor = aesAlg.CreateDecryptor(aesAlg.Key, aesAlg.IV);\n\n            using (MemoryStream msDecrypt = new MemoryStream(cipherText))\n            {\n                using (CryptoStream csDecrypt = new CryptoStream(msDecrypt, decryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Read))\n                {\n                    using (StreamReader srDecrypt = new StreamReader(csDecrypt))\n                    {\n                        return srDecrypt.ReadToEnd();\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void Main()\n    {\n        string original = \"Sensitive data here\";\n        using (Aes aesAlg = Aes.Create())\n        {\n            var encrypted = Encrypt(original, aesAlg.Key, aesAlg.IV);\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Encrypted data: {Convert.ToBase64String(encrypted.Item1)}\");\n\n            string decrypted = Decrypt(encrypted.Item1, aesAlg.Key, aesAlg.IV);\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Decrypted data: {decrypted}\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Enhancing Security with SHA-256\n\nA one-way hash function like SHA-256 enhances security by providing a unique fingerprint for data, which can be used for verification without exposing the original data. It is especially useful for storing passwords securely. By hashing passwords and storing only the hash, even if the database is compromised, the original passwords remain protected.\n\n### Real-World Scenario Using `netstat`\n\n`netstat` is a powerful command-line tool that can be used to identify and troubleshoot network security issues. Here\u2019s how it can be applied:\n\n**Scenario:** Suppose you suspect unauthorized access to your server. By using the `netstat` command, you can list all the active connections and listening ports. For example:\n\n```bash\nnetstat -ano\n```\n\nThis command will display all active connections along with their associated processes. By examining the list, you can identify unusual or suspicious connections, such as unexpected foreign IP addresses or connections that shouldn't be active. You can then use the process ID (PID) to find out which application is responsible and take appropriate action, such as terminating the process or blocking the IP address.\n\nOverall, these tools and techniques can greatly enhance the security of your data and network infrastructure."
