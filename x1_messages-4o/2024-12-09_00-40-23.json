I tried using a `for` loop to iterate through my string, but it iterates character by character, including whitespaces as well. Here's the code I used: \n```python\nstring = \"this is a string\"\nfor word in string:\n    print (word)\n```\nThe output I got is as follows:\n```python\nt\nh\ni\ns\n\ni\ns\n\na\n\ns\nt\nr\ni\nn\ng\n```\nHowever, I am aiming to get the output as:\n```python\nthis\nis\na\nstring\n```"

        "content": "To iterate through a string word by word in Python, you should split the string into a list of words using the `split()` method. This method splits the string at each whitespace by default and returns a list of words. You can then iterate over this list to get each word individually. Here\u2019s how you can modify your code to achieve the desired output:\n\n```python\nstring = \"this is a string\"\nwords = string.split()  # Split the string into words\n\nfor word in words:\n    print(word)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, you'll get the output:\n\n```\nthis\nis\na\nstring\n```\n\nThe `split()` method without any arguments splits the string at any whitespace and removes extra whitespace, which makes it suitable for iterating word by word."
