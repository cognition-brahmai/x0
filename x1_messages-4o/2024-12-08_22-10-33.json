Here are two points of contrast between Mary and Bob based on their personalities:\n\n1. **Social Interaction**:\n   - Mary is outgoing, which means she is likely to enjoy socializing, engaging in conversations, and participating in group activities. She might be comfortable in crowds and enjoy meeting new people.\n   - Bob, being introverted, may prefer solitary activities or spending time with a smaller group of close friends. He might find large social gatherings draining and need some alone time to recharge.\n\n2. **Approach to New Experiences**:\n   - Mary might be more open to trying new things, seeking adventure, and embracing change due to her outgoing nature. She may thrive in dynamic environments and be eager to explore unfamiliar situations.\n   - Bob, on the other hand, might approach new experiences with caution and prefer routines or familiar settings. His introverted nature could lead him to carefully consider new opportunities before engaging with them."
