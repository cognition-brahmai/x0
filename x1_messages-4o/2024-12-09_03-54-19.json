        "content": "Certainly! For parsing non-well-formed HTML using XPath in various programming languages, you have several options:\n\n### Python\n1. **lxml**: This is a powerful library for parsing HTML and XML in Python, and it supports XPath. It's built on top of the C libraries libxml2 and libxslt, which makes it very fast and efficient.\n   ```python\n   from lxml import html\n   tree = html.fromstring(html_content)\n   elements = tree.xpath('//your_xpath_expression')\n   ```\n\n2. **BeautifulSoup**: While BeautifulSoup itself doesn't support XPath directly, it can parse non-well-formed HTML very well. You can combine it with lxml to get the best of both worlds.\n   ```python\n   from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n   soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'lxml')\n   ```\n\n### Ruby\n1. **Nokogiri**: This is a widely used library in Ruby for parsing HTML and XML, and it has robust support for XPath.\n   ```ruby\n   require 'nokogiri'\n   doc = Nokogiri::HTML(html_content)\n   elements = doc.xpath('//your_xpath_expression')\n   ```\n\n### Other Languages\n1. **JavaScript/Node.js**: You can use libraries like **cheerio** for parsing HTML, although it doesn't support XPath directly, it can be used in combination with XPath libraries.\n   ```javascript\n   const cheerio = require('cheerio');\n   const $ = cheerio.load(html_content);\n   // Use CSS selectors, no direct XPath support\n   ```\n\n2. **Java**: You can use **jsoup** for parsing HTML, though it primarily supports CSS selectors. For XPath, you might need to convert to a DOM object or use additional libraries.\n   ```java\n   import org.jsoup.Jsoup;\n   import org.jsoup.nodes.Document;\n   Document doc = Jsoup.parse(htmlContent);\n   ```\n\nThese libraries are well-documented and widely used, so you should find them quite reliable for your projects."
