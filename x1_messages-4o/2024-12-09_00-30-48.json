I am currently using `datetime.datetime.now().strftime(\"%X\")` to display the current time as a string. However, my computer is running in the 'Europe/Berlin' time zone and the offset of +2 to UTC is not accounted for here. Instead of displaying '19:22:26', it should display '21:22:26'. I tried using `datetime.datetime.now().astimezone(timezone('Europe/Berlin'))` but received a ValueError: `astimezone() cannot be applied to a naive datetime`. How can I correctly get the current time in the 'Europe/Berlin' timezone?"

        "content": "To get the current time in the 'Europe/Berlin' timezone using Python, you can use the `pytz` library along with the `datetime` module. The error you're encountering is because `datetime.datetime.now()` returns a naive datetime object that doesn't have timezone information associated with it. You need to make it timezone-aware first before converting it to another timezone.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Install `pytz` if you haven't already. You can do this via pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pytz\n   ```\n\n2. Use the following code to get the current time in the 'Europe/Berlin' timezone:\n\n   ```python\n   from datetime import datetime\n   import pytz\n\n   # Get the current time in UTC\n   utc_now = datetime.now(pytz.utc)\n\n   # Convert it to the 'Europe/Berlin' timezone\n   berlin_tz = pytz.timezone('Europe/Berlin')\n   berlin_time = utc_now.astimezone(berlin_tz)\n\n   # Format the time as desired\n   formatted_time = berlin_time.strftime(\"%X\")\n   print(formatted_time)\n   ```\n\nThis code first gets the current UTC time and then converts it to the 'Europe/Berlin' timezone using `astimezone()`. This makes sure that the time is correctly adjusted for the timezone with daylight saving time accounted for if applicable."
