Even though my code works fine in pure Python, when run in Django, it leads to a RuntimeError: 'tcl_asyncdelete async handler deleted by the wrong thread'. I've minimized my code to just one line 'fig = plt.figure()', but the error still occurs. The relevant part of my code is:\n\n```\n...\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n...\nfig = plt.figure()\n...\nplt.close()\n```\n\nCould this error be related to how I'm closing/cleaning/destroying plots in Python/Django? How can I solve this problem?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, `RuntimeError: 'tcl_asyncdelete async handler deleted by the wrong thread'`, is related to multi-threading issues between the GUI backend of Matplotlib and Django's threading model. This problem usually arises because the default GUI backend that Matplotlib uses is not thread-safe.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n### 1. Use Non-GUI Backends\n\nSince you're running this within a web application (Django), you typically don't need a GUI backend. You can switch Matplotlib to use a non-interactive, non-GUI backend like 'Agg', which is thread-safe and suitable for server-side rendering:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib\nmatplotlib.use('Agg')  # Use the 'Agg' backend for non-GUI rendering\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Your existing code\nfig = plt.figure()\n# ...\nplt.close()\n```\n\n### 2. Thread-Safe Context\n\nEnsure that all Matplotlib-related operations are performed in a single thread. This is important because Django might handle requests in separate threads. If you need to perform Matplotlib operations in a thread-safe manner, you can use a context manager:\n\n```python\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport threading\n\ndef plot_function():\n    with threading.Lock():  # Ensure thread-safe execution\n        fig = plt.figure()\n        # Your plotting code\n        plt.close(fig)\n\n# Call your plot function\nplot_function()\n```\n\n### 3. Check Middleware and Settings\n\nEnsure that your Django settings and middleware configurations do not interfere with threading. For instance, avoid using middleware that might cause the Django application to handle requests in ways that interfere with Matplotlib's backend.\n\n### 4. Debugging and Logs\n\nCheck your server logs for any related warnings or errors that might give you more context about the problem.\n\n### 5. Consider Asynchronous Task Queues\n\nIf your plotting is a resource-intensive task, consider offloading it to a task queue like Celery. This way, the plotting does not interfere with your main application threads.\n\nBy using a non-GUI backend and ensuring that Matplotlib operations are thread-safe, you should be able to resolve the issue. If the problem persists, consider reviewing your Django application\u2019s threading model and any associated middleware or settings that might affect it."
