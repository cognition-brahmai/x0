        "content": "I am trying to send an email from my Office365 corporate account using Python but I'm encountering some difficulties. I previously used my Hotmail account for this task and it worked fine, but now I need to send confidential information through my corporate email. I have confirmed my username and password are correct and I have tried using both Python2 and Python3, but I keep getting the \"535 5.7.3 Authentication unsuccessful\" error. I used the \"mailserver.starttls()\" method when I got this error, then tried to pass a certificate using \"mailserver.starttls(certfile='office365.cer')\". I'm not sure if I'm handling the certificate correctly. I exported the root and the level just below the root from the chain certificate of microsoftonline.com using Chrome browser, but I couldn't export the last level. I'm not sure how to pass both of these files, so I have simply passed the root certificate. However, I'm getting the error: \"ssl.SSLError: [SSL] PEM lib (_ssl.c:3309)\" and I'm not sure how to proceed. Here's the code I have used:\n\n```python\nimport smtplib\n\nmailserver = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.office365.com',587)\nmailserver.ehlo()\nmailserver.starttls(certfile='office365.cer')\nmailserver.ehlo()\nmailserver.login('user@company.co', 'password')\nmailserver.sendmail('user@company.co','user@company.co','python email')\nmailserver.quit()\n```\n\nAny assistance would be appreciated."

        "content": "When dealing with Office 365 and SMTP, the \"535 5.7.3 Authentication unsuccessful\" error generally indicates an issue with authentication. Here are several steps and tips to help you resolve the problem:\n\n1. **App Passwords**: If your organization uses multi-factor authentication (MFA) or has disabled basic authentication, you'll need to create an app password instead of using your standard password. This can typically be done in the security settings of your Office 365 account.\n\n2. **TLS/SSL**: When using `starttls()`, you generally don't need to pass a certificate file. The `starttls()` method initiates an encrypted connection, but the server provides its own certificate. Make sure the Python version you are using supports the latest TLS protocols.\n\n3. **Correct SMTP Server and Port**: Ensure that you are using the correct server and port (`smtp.office365.com` and port `587` for TLS).\n\n4. **Credentials**: Double-check your username and password. The username should be your full email address.\n\n5. **Code Example**: Here's a refined version of your code without the certificate, which should work better:\n\n    ```python\n    import smtplib\n    from email.mime.text import MIMEText\n    from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart\n\n    # Define email parameters\n    sender = 'user@company.co'\n    recipient = 'recipient@company.co'\n    subject = 'Python Email'\n    body = 'This is a test email sent from Python.'\n\n    # Create the email message\n    msg = MIMEMultipart()\n    msg['From'] = sender\n    msg['To'] = recipient\n    msg['Subject'] = subject\n    msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))\n\n    try:\n        # Connect to the server\n        mailserver = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.office365.com', 587)\n        mailserver.ehlo()\n        mailserver.starttls()\n        mailserver.ehlo()\n\n        # Login to the server\n        mailserver.login(sender, 'your_app_password_here')\n\n        # Send the email\n        mailserver.sendmail(sender, recipient, msg.as_string())\n\n        print(\"Email sent successfully!\")\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Failed to send email: {e}\")\n        \n    finally:\n        # Close the connection\n        mailserver.quit()\n    ```\n\n6. **Firewall/Network Restrictions**: Ensure that your network or firewall is not blocking outbound SMTP connections.\n\n7. **Check with IT**: Sometimes, corporate email accounts have specific restrictions or security measures in place. It's a good idea to check with your IT department to ensure that SMTP access is allowed.\n\n8. **Log and Debug**: Use logging to capture detailed information about the SMTP session. This can provide more insights into what's going wrong.\n\nBy ensuring that these configurations are correct, you should be able to successfully send emails using your Office 365 account through Python."
