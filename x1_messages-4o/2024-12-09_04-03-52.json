        "content": "I'm running Python 2.7.3 and I'm experiencing a problem with multiprocessing. When I use a loop over 10,000 or more in my code, my script hangs on `worker.join()`. However, it works fine when the loop only goes to 1,000. Here's the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nfrom multiprocessing import Process, Queue\n\ndef foo(qin, qout):\n    while True:\n        bar = qin.get()\n        if bar is None:\n            break\n        qout.put({'bar': bar})\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    import sys\n\n    qin = Queue()\n    qout = Queue()\n    worker = Process(target=foo,args=(qin,qout))\n    worker.start()\n\n    for i in range(100000):\n        print i\n        sys.stdout.flush()\n        qin.put(i**2)\n\n    qin.put(None)\n    worker.join()\n```\nDoes anyone have any ideas as to why this might be happening?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing with your script hanging on `worker.join()` is likely due to the `Queue` being filled up faster than it can be processed. In Python's `multiprocessing.Queue`, there's a limit to how much data it can hold at any given time. When you put too many items into the queue without processing them, it can block the process because the queue is full and waiting for the consumer to catch up.\n\nHere are a few suggestions to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Increase Queue Size:** You can increase the maximum size of the queue by specifying the `maxsize` parameter when creating the queue. By default, the queue size is unlimited, but this doesn't mean it can handle an infinite amount of data without blocking. Try setting a reasonable size.\n\n   ```python\n   qin = Queue(maxsize=1000)\n   qout = Queue(maxsize=1000)\n   ```\n\n2. **Process Items Faster:** Make sure your consumer process is processing items from the queue at a rate that keeps up with the producer. You might need to optimize the `foo` function or use more worker processes if possible.\n\n3. **Use Multiple Workers:** If your task can be parallelized, you can start multiple worker processes to handle the queue items concurrently.\n\n   ```python\n   workers = []\n   for _ in range(number_of_workers):\n       worker = Process(target=foo, args=(qin, qout))\n       workers.append(worker)\n       worker.start()\n\n   # Join all workers\n   for worker in workers:\n       worker.join()\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for Deadlocks:** Ensure that there are no deadlocks occurring in your code. For example, always ensure that every `put` operation has a corresponding `get` operation and that you are handling the termination of worker processes correctly.\n\n5. **Debugging:** Add some debugging statements or use Python's logging to monitor the flow of data and see where it might be getting stuck. This might give you more insight into the bottleneck.\n\nIf these suggestions do not resolve the issue, consider using a different approach to parallelism, such as Python 3's concurrent futures, which might offer better support and efficiency for your use case."
