        "content": "Certainly! Below is a simple Python program that checks if a user has guessed the secret numerical code correctly. This example uses a predefined secret code and prompts the user to enter their guess. The program then checks if the guess matches the secret code.\n\n```python\ndef check_guess(secret_code, user_guess):\n    if user_guess == secret_code:\n        return \"Congratulations! You've guessed the secret code correctly.\"\n    else:\n        return \"Sorry, that's not the correct code. Try again!\"\n\ndef main():\n    secret_code = 1234  # You can change this to any secret code you want\n    try:\n        user_guess = int(input(\"Enter your guess for the secret code: \"))\n        result = check_guess(secret_code, user_guess)\n        print(result)\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Please enter a valid numerical code.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works:\n1. The `check_guess` function takes two arguments: `secret_code` and `user_guess`, and it compares them.\n2. In the `main` function, the secret code is set, and the user is prompted to input their guess.\n3. The program checks if the user's guess matches the secret code and prints the appropriate message.\n4. There's a simple error handling mechanism to ensure the user inputs a valid number.\n\nYou can modify the `secret_code` variable to any number you prefer as the secret code."
