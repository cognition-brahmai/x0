Can you provide a concise JavaScript code formula that accurately formats the citation for songs? Additionally, could you include guidelines for citing songs in different contexts, such as citing multiple songs from the same artist or album? The song details are stored in a JSON format, including the song title, artist, and release year."

        "content": "To create a properly formatted citation for a song like \"Bad\" by Michael Jackson released in 1987 in APA style, you would generally follow this format:\n\n**APA Citation Format for a Song:**\n\nArtist's Last Name, First Initial. (Year). *Title of the song* [Song]. On *Title of the album*. Record Label.\n\nSince \"Bad\" is a single, it might look like this:\n\n**Example:**\n\nJackson, M. (1987). *Bad* [Song]. On *Bad*. Epic Records.\n\nTo automate this process using JavaScript, you can create a function that takes details from a JSON object and returns a formatted APA citation. Here's a simple code snippet to accomplish this:\n\n```javascript\n// JSON object representing the song details\nconst songDetails = {\n  title: \"Bad\",\n  artist: \"Michael Jackson\",\n  releaseYear: 1987,\n  album: \"Bad\",\n  recordLabel: \"Epic Records\"\n};\n\n// Function to format the song citation in APA style\nfunction formatSongCitation(song) {\n  const artistName = song.artist.split(\" \");\n  const lastName = artistName.pop();\n  const firstInitial = artistName.map(name => name[0]).join(\". \");\n  return `${lastName}, ${firstInitial}. (${song.releaseYear}). *${song.title}* [Song]. On *${song.album}*. ${song.recordLabel}.`;\n}\n\n// Usage\nconst citation = formatSongCitation(songDetails);\nconsole.log(citation);  // Outputs: Jackson, M. (1987). *Bad* [Song]. On *Bad*. Epic Records.\n```\n\n**Guidelines for Citing Songs in Different Contexts:**\n\n1. **Single Song from an Album:**\n   - Use the format above for each song individually.\n\n2. **Multiple Songs from the Same Artist:**\n   - List each song as a separate citation entry.\n\n3. **Multiple Songs from the Same Album:**\n   - You can list them as separate entries or mention the album as a whole if discussing the album's entire context.\n\n4. **Song with Multiple Artists:**\n   - List artists in the order they appear on the track, using an ampersand (&) before the last artist.\n\n5. **Streaming Platforms:**\n   - If accessed from a streaming platform, you might add the platform name at the end: Retrieved from [Streaming Platform].\n\nBy following these guidelines, you'll be able to correctly cite songs in different contexts according to APA style."
