        "content": "To test a function that contains a call to the `input` function in a Python console program using `pytest`, you can use the `unittest.mock` module to replace `input` with a mock object during the test. This allows you to simulate user input without requiring actual manual input.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:\n\n1. Import the necessary modules, including `unittest.mock`.\n2. Use `mock.patch` to replace the `input` function with a mock during the test.\n3. Set the return value of the mocked `input` function to simulate user input.\n4. Call the function you want to test.\n5. Assert the expected outcomes.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nSuppose you have the following function in your program:\n\n```python\ndef ask_question():\n    some_input = input('Answer the question: ')\n    return f'You answered: {some_input}'\n```\n\nYou can write a test for this function as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom unittest import mock\nimport pytest\nfrom your_module import ask_question  # Replace with the actual module name\n\ndef test_ask_question():\n    # Simulate user input\n    with mock.patch('builtins.input', return_value='Yes'):\n        result = ask_question()\n        \n    # Assert the expected outcome\n    assert result == 'You answered: Yes'\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    pytest.main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- `mock.patch('builtins.input', return_value='Yes')`: This line replaces the `input` function with a mock object that always returns `'Yes'`. This simulates the user entering `'Yes'` when prompted.\n- `ask_question()`: Call the function you want to test. The `input` function within this call will be replaced by the mocked version.\n- `assert result == 'You answered: Yes'`: Verify that the function returns the expected output given the simulated input.\n\nBy using this technique, you can automate the testing of functions that rely on user input, making your tests more reliable and easier to run."
