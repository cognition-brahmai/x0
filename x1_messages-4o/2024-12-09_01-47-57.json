I am currently able to suppress these in python 2.7 with etree 1.3 using the `register_namespace` function, but this function was only added in version 1.3. When I tried using the `_namespace_map` in version 1.2.6, the prefixes are still there but are blank, which is not what I want. Is there any way to remove them completely?"

        "content": "In Python 2.6 with the ElementTree library version 1.2.6, you don't have access to the `register_namespace` function, which makes it a bit challenging to suppress XML prefixes completely. However, you can try a workaround to manipulate the XML output and remove the prefixes manually. Here's a strategy you can use:\n\n1. **Serialize the XML to a string**: Convert your ElementTree object to a string using `ElementTree.tostring()`.\n2. **Manipulate the string**: Use regular expressions or string manipulation to remove the unwanted prefixes.\n3. **Parse the modified string back to an ElementTree object**: Once you've cleaned the XML string, you can parse it back into an ElementTree object if needed.\n\nHere's a basic example using string manipulation:\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom xml.etree.ElementTree import ElementTree, Element, tostring, fromstring\n\n# Create an example XML element with namespaces\nroot = Element('{http://example.com}root')\nchild = Element('{http://example.com}child')\nroot.append(child)\n\n# Convert the ElementTree to a string\nxml_string = tostring(root)\n\n# Use a regular expression to remove the namespace prefixes\n# This assumes no other attributes with colons\ncleaned_xml_string = re.sub(r'\\sxmlns(:\\w+)?=\"[^\"]+\"', '', xml_string)\ncleaned_xml_string = re.sub(r'<(/?)(\\w+:)', r'<\\1', cleaned_xml_string)\n\n# Parse back to ElementTree if needed\ncleaned_root = fromstring(cleaned_xml_string)\n\n# Print the cleaned XML\nprint(cleaned_xml_string)\n```\n\n**Caveats**:\n- Be cautious with regular expressions to ensure you don't inadvertently remove or alter other parts of the XML structure.\n- This approach assumes that you're okay with completely removing the namespace information from your XML, which might not be suitable in every case, especially if the namespaces are needed for further processing or validation.\n\nIf you have more complex XML structures or specific requirements, you might need to adjust the regular expression logic accordingly."
