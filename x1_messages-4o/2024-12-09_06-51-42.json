My current code is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport csv\nwith open('my_file.csv', 'r', newline='') as csvfile:\n    lines = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter = ',', quotechar = '|')\n    for line in lines:\n        print(' '.join(line))\n```\n\nHowever, when I run this code, I encounter the following error: \n\n```python\nUnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x96 in position 7386: invalid start byte\n```\n\nUpon reviewing the CSV file, I noticed that removing a single \u00f1 character allows every line to print correctly. Despite searching for solutions to similar problems, I remain uncertain on how to fix this issue or what to decode/encode. Removing the \u00f1 character from the data is not a viable solution for me. How can I resolve this UnicodeDecodeError?"

        "content": "The `UnicodeDecodeError` you're encountering is due to the fact that the CSV file contains characters that are not encoded in UTF-8, which is the default encoding used by Python's `open()` function. The error specifically mentions a byte that cannot be decoded, indicating that the file might be using a different character encoding.\n\nTo fix this issue, you need to determine the correct encoding of your CSV file and explicitly specify it when opening the file. A common encoding that supports characters like \u00f1 is `ISO-8859-1` (also known as `Latin-1`). You might also want to try `cp1252`, which is a Windows encoding that supports such characters.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to specify the encoding:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\n# Try using 'ISO-8859-1' or 'cp1252'\nwith open('my_file.csv', 'r', encoding='ISO-8859-1', newline='') as csvfile:\n    lines = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',', quotechar='|')\n    for line in lines:\n        print(' '.join(line))\n```\n\nIf you're not sure about the encoding, you can try using the `chardet` library to detect it:\n\n1. Install `chardet` using pip:\n   ```\n   pip install chardet\n   ```\n\n2. Use `chardet` to detect the encoding:\n\n```python\nimport chardet\n\n# Detect encoding\nwith open('my_file.csv', 'rb') as f:\n    result = chardet.detect(f.read())\n\n# Use detected encoding\nencoding = result['encoding']\n\nprint(f\"Detected encoding: {encoding}\")\n\nwith open('my_file.csv', 'r', encoding=encoding, newline='') as csvfile:\n    lines = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',', quotechar='|')\n    for line in lines:\n        print(' '.join(line))\n```\n\nThis approach will help you identify the correct encoding and avoid the `UnicodeDecodeError` by ensuring the file is read with the appropriate character set."
