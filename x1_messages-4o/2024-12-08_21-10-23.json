You want to reward employees who have been with the company for more than 10 years by giving them a bonus. However, you only want to give bonuses to employees who work in departments with a total revenue of more than $1 million.\nTo determine which employees should receive the bonus, you need to write a query that returns the names of all eligible employees and their department names. You can use the tables \"employees\", \"departments\", and \"revenues\", which have columns \"employee_id\", \"employee_name\", \"hire_date\", \"department_id\", \"department_name\", and \"revenue\".\nYour query should be optimized for performance, as the company has a large amount of data to process."

        "content": "To achieve this, you can write an SQL query that joins the three tables and applies the necessary filters for employee tenure and department revenue. Here's how you can structure the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT e.employee_name, d.department_name\nFROM employees e\nJOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id\nJOIN revenues r ON d.department_id = r.department_id\nWHERE DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), e.hire_date) > 3650\nAND r.revenue > 1000000;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Table Joins**: We perform joins between the `employees`, `departments`, and `revenues` tables. This allows us to get related data across these tables.\n    - `employees` is joined with `departments` on `department_id`.\n    - `departments` is joined with `revenues` on `department_id`.\n\n2. **Filtering Employees**: We use `DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), e.hire_date) > 3650` to filter employees who have been with the company for more than 10 years. The number 3650 is used because it represents the number of days in 10 years (considering 365 days per year).\n\n3. **Filtering Departments**: We apply the condition `r.revenue > 1000000` to ensure that only departments with revenue over $1 million are considered.\n\n4. **Selecting Output**: The query selects the `employee_name` from the `employees` table and `department_name` from the `departments` table for each eligible employee.\n\nThis query is optimized for performance by using joins and filtering conditions effectively. However, you should ensure that the relevant columns have appropriate indexes for further performance optimization, especially in large datasets."
