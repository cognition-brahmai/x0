Here are the models: \n\n```python\nclass Event(models.Model):\n    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n\nclass Participant(models.Model):\n    event = models.ForeignKey(Event, db_index=True)\n    is_paid = models.BooleanField(default=False, db_index=True)\n```\n\nIt's straightforward to annotate an events query with the total number of participants:\n\n```python\nevents = Event.objects.all().annotate(participants=models.Count('participant'))\n```\n\nHowever, I'm unsure how to annotate with the count of participants filtered by `is_paid=True`. I need to query all events, regardless of the number of participants. So, if there are `0` participants, that's fine, I just need `0` in the annotated value. The example from the documentation doesn't work here because it excludes objects from the query instead of annotating them with `0`. \n\nI noticed that Django 1.8 has a new conditional expressions feature, and Django 2.0 has a new conditional aggregation feature. How can I use these features to solve my problem?"

        "content": "To annotate your `Event` queryset with the count of `Participant` objects where `is_paid=True`, you can use Django's conditional aggregation feature, which was introduced in Django 2.0. This allows you to use the `Count` function with a `filter` argument. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db.models import Count, Q\n\n# Annotate the events with the count of participants where is_paid=True\nevents = Event.objects.annotate(\n    paid_participants_count=Count('participant', filter=Q(participant__is_paid=True))\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`Count('participant')`:** This counts the number of related `Participant` objects for each `Event`.\n\n- **`filter=Q(participant__is_paid=True)`:** This part specifies the condition for counting. It uses the `Q` object to filter participants where `is_paid` is `True`.\n\n- **`paid_participants_count`:** This is the alias for the annotated field that will hold the count of paid participants.\n\nThis will give you an `Event` queryset where each `Event` instance has an additional attribute `paid_participants_count` containing the count of participants who have `is_paid=True`. Events with no participants or no paid participants will correctly have a count of `0`.\n\nThis solution leverages the conditional aggregation feature available from Django 2.0 onwards. If you are using an older version of Django, you would need to upgrade to at least Django 2.0 to use this feature."
