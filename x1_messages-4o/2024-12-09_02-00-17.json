        "content": "Django Rest Framework (DRF) discourages model-level validation within serializers to maintain a clear separation of concerns, which is a fundamental software engineering principle. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the rationale:\n\n1. **Separation of Concerns**: By keeping validation logic within serializers, DRF promotes a cleaner separation between what is considered the \"data representation\" layer and the \"business logic\" or \"domain logic\" layer. This means that serializers are responsible for validating data that is coming into your API (such as format and type checks), while models should focus on the logic and constraints that are directly tied to the database schema.\n\n2. **Decoupling of Layers**: By avoiding model-level validation in serializers, DRF allows the serialization process to be more flexible and decoupled from the database layer. This separation allows for easier testing, maintenance, and evolution of each layer independently. You can change the validation logic in your serializer without necessarily having to alter your database schema or vice versa.\n\n3. **Flexibility in Validation**: Serializers can be used in contexts where the model\u2019s `clean` method might not be appropriate or necessary. For instance, you might want to perform different types of validation depending on whether data is coming from an API, a form, or other sources.\n\n4. **Avoiding Redundancy**: DRF serializers can handle complex validation scenarios that might not be possible or efficient within the `clean` method alone. While model-level validation is still important for ensuring data integrity at the database level, serializers provide a more expressive way to handle validation at the data input level.\n\n5. **Adhering to API Design Principles**: DRF is designed to be used for building RESTful APIs. In this context, the validation logic that applies to the data being transferred over the network (often JSON or XML) can differ from the constraints that apply to data being stored in a relational database.\n\nIn summary, the decision not to call `Model.clean` during serializer validation in DRF is about maintaining a clear boundary between different parts of an application, allowing each to evolve independently, and ensuring that the API layer remains flexible and decoupled from the database logic."
