        "content": "The advent of blockchain technology has revolutionized the way we think about security and transparency in digital transactions. At its core, blockchain works as a decentralized ledger that records transactions across many computers so that the registered data cannot be altered retroactively. Developers initially faced the challenge of ensuring network scalability while maintaining the security of the blockchain, as well as the difficulty of achieving consensus among distributed nodes. To tackle scalability, developers implemented solutions such as the Lightning Network for Bitcoin, which allows for faster transactions by creating off-chain payment channels. Meanwhile, Ethereum developers introduced smart contracts, overcoming the consensus issue by allowing programmable transactions, which are executed automatically when conditions are met. This innovation parallels the historical event of the Netscape IPO in 1995, which marked the beginning of the internet boom and drastically reshaped how businesses operated online. Reflecting on blockchain\u2019s impact, it has not only transformed industries like finance and supply chain management but also holds the potential to redefine trust and governance in future technological advancements."
