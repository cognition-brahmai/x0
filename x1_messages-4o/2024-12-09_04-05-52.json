I've used the `timeit` module to test the time difference and I've noticed that Python 3 is over 1.5 times slower for this common operation. Is this an issue that is operating system or processor dependent?\n\nCode:\n```python\nimport timeit\nt=timeit.timeit('mylist[99]',setup='mylist=list(range(100))',number=10000000)\nprint (t)\nt=timeit.timeit('mylist[-1]',setup='mylist=list(range(100))',number=10000000)\nprint (t)\n```\n\nPython 2.6 output:\n```shell\n$ python2.6 test.py\n0.587687015533\n0.586369991302\n```\n\nPython 3.2 output:\n```shell\n$ python3.2 test.py\n0.9212150573730469\n1.0225799083709717\n```\n\nOperating system: OS-X (10.5.8) -- Intel Core2Duo"

        "content": "The difference in performance when indexing lists with positive versus negative integers between Python 2 and Python 3 can be attributed to several factors. While not specifically tied to operating systems or processors, some of the changes in Python 3 that could contribute to this difference include:\n\n1. **Unicode Strings**: Python 3 made all string handling Unicode by default, which could affect performance in various operations, including list indexing, if there are string operations involved elsewhere in the setup.\n\n2. **Integer Type Changes**: Python 3 unified `int` and `long` into a single `int` type, which may have introduced additional overhead in operations involving integers.\n\n3. **Internal Changes**: Python 3 introduced several internal and architectural changes to improve the language's consistency and behavior, which might have inadvertently affected the performance characteristics of certain operations.\n\n4. **Optimization Differences**: Python 2 and Python 3 have different optimization levels for various operations. Python 3 is designed with future enhancements and readability in mind, which sometimes means sacrificing a bit of performance for clarity.\n\n5. **Implementation Details**: There might be subtle differences in how list indexing is implemented between Python 2 and Python 3, especially with negative indexing, which requires calculating the offset from the end of the list.\n\nTo get a better understanding, you could delve into the CPython source code to see the specific changes between the two versions. However, these differences are generally minor and should not significantly impact most applications. If performance is a critical concern, you might consider using profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and look into alternative data structures or algorithms that better suit your needs."
