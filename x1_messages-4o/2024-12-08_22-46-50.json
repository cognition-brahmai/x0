        "content": "To rearrange a list of integers in ascending order, you can use an efficient sorting algorithm like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, or Heap Sort. Here's how you can do it using Python's built-in sorting function, which typically uses Timsort, a highly efficient sorting algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef sort_list(numbers):\n    return sorted(numbers)\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [34, 7, 23, 32, 5, 62]\nsorted_numbers = sort_list(numbers)\nprint(sorted_numbers)\n```\n\nThis will sort the list `[34, 7, 23, 32, 5, 62]` into `[5, 7, 23, 32, 34, 62]`. The `sorted()` function in Python is both efficient and easy to use."
