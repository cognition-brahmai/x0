I tried changing `SummaryWriter` to `FileWriter`:\n\n```python\nwriter = tf.train.FileWriter('./my_graph', sess.graph)\n```\n\nBut I get the same error: `AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'FileWriter'`. How do I fix this error?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is likely due to the fact that TensorFlow 0.12 is quite old, and there might have been changes or inconsistencies in how certain functionalities, such as logging and writing summaries, were handled back then.\n\nHowever, the typical approach in later versions of TensorFlow for writing summaries to visualize in TensorBoard is using `tf.summary.FileWriter`. Since you're using TensorFlow 0.12, the module path might be different, or the functionality might not exist in the exact form you're trying to use.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to troubleshoot and potentially fix your issue:\n\n1. **Check TensorFlow Version:**\n   Ensure you're indeed using TensorFlow 0.12. You can check your TensorFlow version by running:\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n   print(tf.__version__)\n   ```\n\n2. **Correct Module Path:**\n   In TensorFlow 0.12, the correct import path for `SummaryWriter` should be:\n   ```python\n   writer = tf.summary.FileWriter('./my_graph', sess.graph)\n   ```\n   However, if `tf.summary.FileWriter` isn't available, you may need to verify the exact path or use an alternate approach since older versions might not have had the `tf.summary` module structured the same way.\n\n3. **Upgrade TensorFlow:**\n   If feasible, consider upgrading to a more recent version of TensorFlow that supports Python 3 and has more stable and well-documented APIs. TensorFlow 1.0 and above have significant improvements, and the `tf.summary.FileWriter` was well-supported.\n\n4. **Use Available Documentation:**\n   Review TensorFlow 0.12 documentation, if available, for the exact syntax and available functions. The API might have been different back then.\n\n5. **Alternative Methods:**\n   If you can't resolve the issue with `SummaryWriter` or `FileWriter`, consider updating your code to use other logging mechanisms available in your version, or manually install a compatible version of TensorFlow that supports the needed features.\n\nHere's an updated version of your code assuming you're able to transition to a version where `tf.summary.FileWriter` is available:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\na = tf.constant(5, name=\"input_a\")\nb = tf.constant(3, name=\"input_b\")\nc = tf.multiply(a, b, name=\"mul_c\")  # Use tf.multiply instead of tf.mul\nd = tf.add(a, b, name=\"add_d\")\ne = tf.add(c, d, name=\"add_e\")\n\nsess = tf.Session()\n\n# Initialize variables if any\nsess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())\n\noutput = sess.run(e)\nprint(\"Output:\", output)\n\n# Use tf.summary.FileWriter\nwriter = tf.summary.FileWriter('./my_graph', sess.graph)\n\nwriter.close()\nsess.close()\n```\n\nIf you decide to upgrade, remember to transition to Python 3 as well, since Python 2.7 is no longer officially supported."
