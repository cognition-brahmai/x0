I have two directories 'bar' and 'baz' both containing one or more files, and I want to copy all their contents into another directory 'foo'. I tried using the `shutil.copytree()` function like so:\n\n```python\nimport shutil\nshutil.copytree('bar', 'foo')\nshutil.copytree('baz', 'foo')\n```\n\nHowever, I got an 'OSError: [Errno 17] File exists: 'foo'' error. This is the error that I received:\n\n```python\n$ python copytree_test.py \nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"copytree_test.py\", line 5, in &lt;module&gt;\n    shutil.copytree('baz', 'foo')\n  File \"/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/shutil.py\", line 110, in copytree\n  File \"/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/os.py\", line 172, in makedirs\nOSError: [Errno 17] File exists: 'foo'\n```\n\nI want to achieve the same effect as running the following commands in a terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ mkdir foo\n$ cp bar/* foo/\n$ cp baz/* foo/\n```\n\nDo I need to use `shutil.copy()` to individually copy each file from 'baz' into 'foo' after I've already copied the contents of 'bar' into 'foo' using `shutil.copytree()`? Or is there a simpler or more efficient method?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired effect of copying the contents of multiple directories into an existing directory, `shutil.copytree()` isn't the best choice because it expects the target directory not to exist. Instead, you can use `shutil.copy()` or `shutil.copy2()` in combination with `os.walk()` to copy files individually. Here\u2019s a simple and efficient way to do it:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport shutil\n\ndef copy_directory_contents(src, dest):\n    # Ensure the destination directory exists\n    if not os.path.exists(dest):\n        os.makedirs(dest)\n    \n    # Walk through each file in the source directory\n    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(src):\n        for file in files:\n            # Determine the full path of the source and destination files\n            src_file = os.path.join(root, file)\n            dest_file = os.path.join(dest, file)\n            \n            # Copy each file from the source to the destination directory\n            shutil.copy2(src_file, dest_file)\n            print(f\"Copied {src_file} to {dest_file}\")\n\n# Create the destination directory if it doesn't exist\ndestination_dir = 'foo'\nif not os.path.exists(destination_dir):\n    os.makedirs(destination_dir)\n\n# Copy contents of 'bar' and 'baz' into 'foo'\ncopy_directory_contents('bar', destination_dir)\ncopy_directory_contents('baz', destination_dir)\n```\n\nHere\u2019s what this script does:\n1. It defines a function `copy_directory_contents` that copies all files from a source directory to a destination directory.\n2. It walks through each file in the source directory using `os.walk()`.\n3. For each file, it constructs the source and destination paths and uses `shutil.copy2()` to copy the file. `shutil.copy2()` is similar to `shutil.copy()` but also attempts to preserve metadata.\n4. It ensures the destination directory exists before attempting to copy any files.\n\nThis method mimics the behavior of the terminal commands you mentioned (`cp bar/* foo/` and `cp baz/* foo/`) and should work efficiently for your use case."
