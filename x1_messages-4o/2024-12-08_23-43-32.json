This gem analyzes words based on their morphological features and syntactic distribution.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to use `engtagger` to identify the syntactic category of \"amaze\":\n\n1. **Install the `engtagger` gem**:\n   First, you need to install the gem by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   gem install engtagger\n   ```\n\n2. **Write the Ruby code**:\n   Now, you can write a Ruby script to analyze the word \"amaze\":\n\n   ```ruby\n   require 'engtagger'\n\n   # Initialize the EngTagger\n   tagger = EngTagger.new\n\n   # Sentence or context containing the word 'amaze'\n   sentence = \"The magician's tricks amaze the audience.\"\n\n   # Add part-of-speech tags to the sentence\n   tagged_sentence = tagger.add_tags(sentence)\n\n   # Extract words with their parts of speech\n   words_with_pos = tagger.get_words(tagged_sentence)\n\n   # Find and print the syntactic category of the word \"amaze\"\n   words_with_pos.each do |word, pos|\n     if word == 'amaze'\n       puts \"'#{word}' is identified as a '#{pos}'\"\n     end\n   end\n   ```\n\n3. **Run the script**:\n   Execute the script using the Ruby interpreter:\n\n   ```bash\n   ruby your_script_name.rb\n   ```\n\nThe output will display the syntactic category of the word \"amaze\" based on its context in the sentence. The `engtagger` gem uses a rule-based approach to determine the part of speech, providing a simple way to analyze words in a given context.\n\nRemember, the accuracy of identifying the correct syntactic category can depend on the context in which the word is used, as words can have multiple categories depending on their usage."
