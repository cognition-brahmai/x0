I have RabbitMQ and Celery running locally on my Mac (OS/X 10.13.4), and the following code works locally when I run add.delay(x,y):\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nfrom celery import Celery\nfrom celery.utils.log import get_task_logger\n\nlogger = get_task_logger(__name__)\n\napp = Celery('tasks', \\\n        broker='pyamqp://appuser:xx@c2/appvhost', \\\n        backend='db+mysql://appuser:xx@c2/pigpen')\n\n@app.task(bind=True)\ndef dump_context(self, x, y):\n    print('Executing task id {0.id}, args: {0.args!r} kwargs {0.kwargs!r}'.format(self.request))\n\n@app.task\ndef add(x, y):\n    logger.info('Adding {0} + {1}'.format(x, y))\n    return x + y\n```\n\nHowever, when I try to run the Celery worker on the ODROID-C2, I get the following error when running `celery -A tasks worker --loglevel=info`:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/local/bin/celery\", line 11, in &lt;module&gt;\n    sys.exit(main())\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/celery/__main__.py\", line 14, in main\n    _main()\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/celery/bin/celery.py\", line 326, in main\n    cmd.execute_from_commandline(argv)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/celery/bin/celery.py\", line 488, in execute_from_commandline\n    super(CeleryCommand, self).execute_from_commandline(argv)))\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/celery/bin/base.py\", line 281, in execute_from_commandline\n    return self.handle_argv(self.prog_name, argv[1:])\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/celery/bin/celery.py\", line 480, in handle_argv\n    return self.execute(command, argv)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/celery/bin/celery.py\", line 412, in execute\n    ).run_from_argv(self.prog_name, argv[1:], command=argv[0])\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/celery/bin/worker.py\", line 221, in run_from_argv\n    return self(*args, **options)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/celery/bin/base.py\", line 244, in __call__\n    ret = self.run(*args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/celery/bin/worker.py\", line 255, in run\n    **kwargs)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/celery/worker/worker.py\", line 99, in __init__\n    self.setup_instance(**self.prepare_args(**kwargs))\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/celery/worker/worker.py\", line 122, in setup_instance\n    self.should_use_eventloop() if use_eventloop is None\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/celery/worker/worker.py\", line 241, in should_use_eventloop\n    self._conninfo.transport.implements.async and\n  File \"/home/autossh/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/kombu/transport/base.py\", line 125, in __getattr__\n    raise AttributeError(key)\nAttributeError: async\n```\n\nI am able to connect to the RabbitMQ instance on the host named c2 using a Python Pika script and MySQL from the ODROID device works to the c2 machine as well. I have found similar errors, but none of the solutions have worked for me. The Celery version installed on the ODROID-C2 via pip is 4.1.0. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering indicates that there is a problem with the event loop detection in Celery when using the specific transport. This issue can arise from several factors, including compatibility between the versions of Celery, Kombu (the messaging library used by Celery), and the transport (RabbitMQ in this case). Here's how you can troubleshoot and potentially resolve this:\n\n1. **Upgrade Celery and Kombu:**\n   Ensure that you have the latest versions of Celery and Kombu. Sometimes, bugs are fixed in newer versions. You can upgrade them using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade celery kombu\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Kombu Version:**\n   Verify which version of Kombu is installed. Some versions might have specific issues with event loops. You can check the installed version with:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip show kombu\n   ```\n\n   If you find that the version is outdated or known to have issues, consider upgrading or downgrading to a stable version.\n\n3. **Explicitly Configure Transport Options:**\n   Try explicitly setting the transport options in your configuration:\n\n   ```python\n   app.conf.update(\n       broker_transport_options={'visibility_timeout': 3600}\n   )\n   ```\n\n   This might help if there are specific transport-related configuration requirements.\n\n4. **Check Python Version Compatibility:**\n   Ensure that the Python version on the ODROID-C2 is compatible with the versions of Celery and Kombu you are using. Python 2.7 is quite old, and many libraries have moved on to requiring Python 3.x for their latest versions.\n\n5. **Use a Virtual Environment:**\n   If you're not already using a virtual environment, consider setting one up. This can help manage dependencies more cleanly and avoid conflicts:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install python3-venv\n   python3 -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n   pip install celery[redis]  # or install the specific broker you are using\n   ```\n\n6. **Test with Different Broker:**\n   As a temporary measure to isolate the problem, you could test using a different broker, such as Redis, to see if the issue persists.\n\n7. **Check Network Configuration:**\n   Ensure that there are no network issues between the ODROID-C2 and the RabbitMQ server. Firewalls or network configurations might block necessary ports.\n\n8. **Consult Celery Documentation:**\n   Review the Celery documentation for any specific notes regarding your setup. Sometimes, known issues or specific configurations are documented there.\n\n9. **Enable Debug Logging:**\n   Enable debug logging to get more detailed output, which can help diagnose the issue:\n\n   ```bash\n   celery -A tasks worker --loglevel=DEBUG\n   ```\n\nBy systematically going through these steps, you should be able to identify the root cause of the issue and resolve it. If the problem persists, consider reaching out to the Celery community or support channels with detailed information about your setup and the steps you've taken."
