        "content": "To compare floating point numbers for near-equality in Python, it is generally recommended to use a tolerance-based approach due to the inherent issues with floating-point precision and rounding errors. Python provides a standard library function, `math.isclose()`, which is specifically designed for this purpose.\n\nHere's how you can use `math.isclose()`:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Example usage\na = 0.1 + 0.2\nb = 0.3\n\n# Compare using math.isclose\nare_close = math.isclose(a, b, rel_tol=1e-09, abs_tol=0.0)\nprint(are_close)  # Output: True\n```\n\nThe `math.isclose()` function compares two floating-point numbers and returns `True` if they are close to each other, within a specified tolerance. It takes the following parameters:\n\n- `a`: the first number to compare.\n- `b`: the second number to compare.\n- `rel_tol`: the relative tolerance \u2013 this is the maximum allowed difference between `a` and `b`, relative to the larger of the magnitudes of `a` or `b`. By default, it is set to `1e-09`.\n- `abs_tol`: the absolute tolerance \u2013 this is the minimum absolute difference allowed between `a` and `b`. By default, it is set to `0.0`.\n\nUsing these parameters, you can customize the tolerance levels to suit your specific needs, allowing for an effective comparison of floating-point numbers."
