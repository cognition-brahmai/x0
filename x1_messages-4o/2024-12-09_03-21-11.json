        "content": "In Python, I am trying to understand the concept of class and instance variables. I have created an example code with a class called 'Animal'. I have declared 'energy' and 'skills' as class variables, outside of any method. Within the methods, I modify these variables with 'self' in their declaration. However, I am confused as the results show that 'energy' takes different values for each object (like an instance variable), while 'skills' seems to be shared (like a class variable). Can someone help me understand this behavior?\n\n```python\nclass Animal(object):\n    energy = 10\n    skills = []\n\n    def work(self):\n        print 'I do something'\n        self.energy -= 1\n\n    def new_skill(self, skill):\n        self.skills.append(skill)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n\n    a1 = Animal()\n    a2 = Animal()\n\n    a1.work()\n    print a1.energy  # result:9\n    print a2.energy  # result:10\n\n\n    a1.new_skill('bark')\n    a2.new_skill('sleep')\n    print a1.skills  # result:['bark', 'sleep']\n    print a2.skills  # result:['bark', 'sleep']\n```"

        "content": "In Python, class variables are shared across all instances of the class, whereas instance variables are unique to each instance. The behavior you are observing in your `Animal` class is due to the nature of how mutable and immutable types work in Python.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`energy` (Immutable Type):**\n   - `energy` is a class variable, initially set to `10`. \n   - When you access `self.energy` within an instance method and modify it using `self.energy -= 1`, you are creating a new instance variable `energy` for that particular object (`a1`). This happens because integers are immutable in Python, and modifying them creates a new object rather than changing the existing one.\n   - Therefore, `a1.energy` becomes an instance variable with a value of `9`, while `a2.energy` still refers to the class variable with the value of `10`.\n\n2. **`skills` (Mutable Type):**\n   - `skills` is also a class variable, initialized as an empty list `[]`.\n   - When you use `self.skills.append(skill)`, you're modifying the list object that `skills` refers to. Since lists are mutable, the modification affects the shared class-level list.\n   - As a result, both `a1` and `a2` see the same list, which now contains `['bark', 'sleep']`.\n\n### Solution:\n\nTo achieve the intended behavior where each `Animal` instance has its own `skills` list, you should initialize `skills` as an instance variable within the `__init__` method. Here is how you can modify your class to achieve this separation:\n\n```python\nclass Animal(object):\n    energy = 10\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.skills = []\n\n    def work(self):\n        print('I do something')\n        self.energy -= 1\n\n    def new_skill(self, skill):\n        self.skills.append(skill)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n\n    a1 = Animal()\n    a2 = Animal()\n\n    a1.work()\n    print(a1.energy)  # result:9\n    print(a2.energy)  # result:10\n\n    a1.new_skill('bark')\n    a2.new_skill('sleep')\n    print(a1.skills)  # result:['bark']\n    print(a2.skills)  # result:['sleep']\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Immutable types** (like integers) when modified in an instance method create instance variables.\n- **Mutable types** (like lists) when modified affect the shared class variable unless they are initialized per instance in the constructor (`__init__`)."
