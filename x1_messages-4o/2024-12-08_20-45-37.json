However, you are only allowed to use three colors in your chart to ensure easy interpretation. How can you effectively display the sales data for all 10 products while still adhering to the color restriction and making it visually appealing for non-technical stakeholders? Remember, you want to ensure that the stakeholders can easily understand the data without needing a background in data analysis."

        "content": "To effectively present the sales data for 10 different products across three regions using only three colors, you can implement the following strategy:\n\n1. **Use a Combination of Chart Types**: To break down the complexity of the data, you can use a combination of a stacked bar chart and a line chart. The stacked bar chart can represent the sales data for the 10 products, while the line chart can overlay the total sales per region.\n\n2. **Color Strategy**:\n   - **Color 1**: Assign this color to the baseline of the stacked bar chart, representing the sales for each product. This color will be used in varying shades to differentiate between products.\n   - **Color 2**: Use this for the boundary lines or separators between different products in the stacked bar chart. This will help in distinguishing between individual products within the same bar.\n   - **Color 3**: Use this for the line chart that represents the total sales per region. This will be distinct and allow stakeholders to easily track the overall performance per region.\n\n3. **Shading and Patterns**: Since you are limited to three colors, you can use different shades of the first color for different products. Additionally, use patterns such as stripes or dots within the sections of the stacked bar to differentiate between products further.\n\n4. **Clear Labels and Annotations**: Ensure each segment of the chart is clearly labeled with the product name and its sales figures. Use annotations to highlight key insights or trends, such as the highest selling product or the best-performing region.\n\n5. **Interactive Elements**: If presenting digitally, consider incorporating interactive elements where stakeholders can hover over segments of the chart to see detailed data pop-ups.\n\n6. **Simplified Legend**: Provide a legend that clearly explains the color and pattern scheme used in the chart. The legend should be intuitive and easy to match with the visual elements on the chart.\n\n7. **Emphasize Key Insights**: Use callouts or highlighted sections to draw attention to areas of particular interest, such as where sales exceeded expectations or where there is a noticeable trend.\n\nBy carefully strategizing the use of colors, shades, patterns, and annotations, you can effectively convey complex sales data in a visually appealing and easily interpretable manner for non-technical stakeholders."
