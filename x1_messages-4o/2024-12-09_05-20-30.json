I want to implement a feature where a user can browse the site as an anonymous user and there will be a login link on every page. When the user clicks on the login link, they are taken to the login form. After a successful login, the user should be taken back to the page from where they clicked the login link. I assume I need to pass the URL of the current page to the view that handles the login form, but I'm having trouble implementing this. Here is my current code:\n\nLink on foo.html:\n```\n<a href='/login/?next={{ request.path }}'>Login</a>\n```\nMy custom login view:\n```\ndef login_view(request):\n   redirect_to = request.REQUEST.get('next', '')\n   if request.method=='POST':\n      #create login form...\n      if valid login credentials have been entered:\n         return HttpResponseRedirect(redirect_to)  \n   #...\n   return render_to_response('login.html', locals())\n```\nAnd the important line in login.html:\n```\n<form method=\"post\" action=\"./?next={{ redirect_to }}\">\n```"

        "content": "To implement the feature where a user is redirected back to the page they were on after a successful login, you need to ensure that the `next` parameter is correctly passed and handled throughout the login process. Your approach is mostly correct, but there are a few improvements and best practices you can follow:\n\n1. **Use `request.GET` Instead of `request.REQUEST`:** In Django, `request.REQUEST` is deprecated. You should use `request.GET` for retrieving query parameters.\n\n2. **Handle `next` Parameter Appropriately:** Make sure to safely handle the `next` parameter to avoid open redirect vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Correct Form Action:** Ensure that the form action correctly includes the `next` parameter.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n### Updated `foo.html`\n\nMake sure the login link correctly passes the current path:\n\n```html\n<a href=\"{% url 'login' %}?next={{ request.path }}\">Login</a>\n```\n\n### Updated `login_view`\n\nHere's an updated version of your `login_view` function:\n\n```python\nfrom django.shortcuts import render, redirect\nfrom django.contrib.auth import authenticate, login\nfrom django.http import HttpResponseRedirect\n\ndef login_view(request):\n    redirect_to = request.GET.get('next', '/')\n    \n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        username = request.POST['username']\n        password = request.POST['password']\n        user = authenticate(request, username=username, password=password)\n\n        if user is not None:\n            login(request, user)\n            # Ensure the redirect isn't to a malicious site\n            if redirect_to and not redirect_to.startswith('/'):\n                redirect_to = '/'\n            return HttpResponseRedirect(redirect_to)\n        else:\n            # Handle invalid login\n            error_message = \"Invalid login credentials\"\n    \n    return render(request, 'login.html', {'redirect_to': redirect_to})\n```\n\n### Updated `login.html`\n\nEnsure the form action correctly includes the `next` parameter:\n\n```html\n<form method=\"post\" action=\"?next={{ redirect_to }}\">\n    {% csrf_token %}\n    <!-- Your form fields here -->\n    <input type=\"text\" name=\"username\" required>\n    <input type=\"password\" name=\"password\" required>\n    <button type=\"submit\">Login</button>\n</form>\n```\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- **CSRF Protection:** Make sure your form includes `{% csrf_token %}` to protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.\n  \n- **Default Redirect:** If there is no `next` parameter, or if it's invalid, redirect the user to a default page (e.g., home page).\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to redirect users back to the page they were on before logging in. Make sure to test thoroughly to ensure the `next` parameter is correctly handled and validated."
