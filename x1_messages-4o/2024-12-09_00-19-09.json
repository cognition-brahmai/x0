For normalising the y-axis, I have applied a logarithmic scale using plt.yscale('log'). However, I am encountering an error stating \"Image size of 1005x132589 pixels is too large. It must be less than 2^16 in each direction\". If I do not use plt.yscale('log'), the code works perfectly fine. I have tried restarting my kernel as recommended but the issue persists. Could someone offer a solution to this problem? Here is my code:\n\n```python\n# data collected to list. \nlist_alarms = df_region.alarmName\n# list_east = df_region.EAST\nlist_west = df_region.WEST\nlist_north = df_region.NORTH\nlist_south = df_region.SOUTH\n\n# X-ticks customization\nN = len(list_alarms)\nxpos = np.arange(N)\n\n# this json file is used to update the style of the plot. \ns = json.load(open('style.json'))    \nrcParams.update(s)\n\n# Graph customize\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (15,8)\nplt.xlabel('AlarmNames at different Regions')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency for alarms in MNG-PAN devices')\nplt.title('Alarm Generated by MNG-PAN Device at different Regions')\nplt.xticks(xpos, list_alarms, rotation = 280)\n\n# bar1 = plt.bar(xpos - 0.3,list_east, width = 0.2, label = 'EAST', color = '#3154C8')\nbar2 = plt.bar(xpos - 0.1, list_west, label = 'WEST', color = '#FF9633')\nbar3 = plt.bar(xpos + 0.1, list_north, label = 'NORTH', color ='#12B794')\nbar4 = plt.bar(xpos + 0.3, list_south, label = 'SOUTH', color ='#EF6FE3')\nplt.yscale('log')\nplt.legend()\n\ndef autolabel(rects):\n    for rect in rects:\n        height = rect.get_height()\n        if height < 10000:\n            plt.text(rect.get_x() + rect.get_width()/2., 1.05*height, \n                 '%d'%int(height),\n                 ha = 'center', va = 'bottom', rotation = 90, \n    fontsize=9)\n\n# # autolabel(bar1)\nautolabel(bar2)\nautolabel(bar3)\nautolabel(bar4)\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nI am using Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, and Python3."

        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to the size of the image being generated when using `plt.yscale('log')`. This error occurs because the logarithmic scale causes the plotting library to attempt to render an image with dimensions that exceed the allowable limits.\n\nHere are some steps to try and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Limit the Y-axis Range**: You can try setting a limit to the y-axis to prevent it from trying to plot extremely large values, which might reduce the size of the image being generated.\n\n    ```python\n    plt.ylim(1, max(list_west + list_north + list_south) * 1.1)\n    ```\n\n2. **Filter Out Zero or Very Small Values**: Logarithmic scales cannot handle zero or negative values. Ensure that your data does not contain zeros or try replacing them with a small positive value (e.g., 0.1).\n\n3. **Check Data for Outliers**: Large outliers can cause issues with a log scale. Check your data for any such values and decide if they should be handled differently.\n\n4. **Adjust Figure Size**: Although you have already set the figure size, you might want to try different sizes to see if it helps.\n\n    ```python\n    plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (12, 6)\n    ```\n\n5. **Use a Different Backend**: Sometimes the backend used by Matplotlib can cause issues. Try switching to a different one, such as `Agg` which is a non-GUI backend.\n\n    ```python\n    import matplotlib\n    matplotlib.use('Agg')\n    ```\n\n6. **Check Your Data Range**: Ensure that the range of data you are plotting is appropriate for a log scale. Extremely large ranges can result in large images.\n\n7. **Simplify the Plot**: If the above steps don't work, you might need to simplify your plot, either by reducing the number of bars or by plotting only a subset of your data.\n\n8. **Use Alternative Plotting Libraries**: If Matplotlib continues to give issues, you may consider other plotting libraries like `seaborn` or `plotly` which might handle large data differently.\n\nIf none of these suggestions resolve the issue, it might be helpful to further investigate the data to understand why the logarithmic scaling is causing such large image dimensions."
