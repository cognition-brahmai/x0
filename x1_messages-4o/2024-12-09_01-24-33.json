        "content": "It seems like you're encountering a persistent issue with your CUDA Toolkit version. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the problem:\n\n1. **Uninstall Older CUDA Versions:**\n   - Ensure that any older versions of the CUDA Toolkit are completely uninstalled. You can do this via the Control Panel on Windows or using package managers on Linux.\n   - After uninstalling, make sure to remove any leftover files or directories related to older CUDA installations.\n\n2. **Check Environment Variables:**\n   - Verify that your system's environment variables (like `CUDA_HOME` or `PATH`) are pointing to the correct installation directory for CUDA 6.5. You might also want to check `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` on Linux.\n\n3. **Update GPU Drivers:**\n   - Make sure your GPU drivers are up-to-date and compatible with CUDA 6.5. Sometimes, outdated drivers can cause version mismatches.\n\n4. **Reinstall CUDA 6.5:**\n   - Download the CUDA 6.5 installer from the NVIDIA website and reinstall it. Make sure to select the correct options during installation.\n\n5. **Verify Installation:**\n   - After reinstalling, verify the installation by checking the CUDA version with the `nvcc --version` command in the terminal or command prompt.\n\n6. **Matlab Configuration:**\n   - If you are using MATLAB, ensure MATLAB is configured to use the correct CUDA version. Sometimes MATLAB might be pointing to an older version if it was configured at a previous time.\n\n7. **Clear Cache/Temporary Files:**\n   - Clear any cached or temporary files that might be causing the system to read an older configuration.\n\n8. **Consult Documentation/Forums:**\n   - Refer to the official NVIDIA documentation or community forums for any specific instructions or known issues related to your GPU model and CUDA version.\n\nIf you've tried all these steps and the issue persists, it might be helpful to check for any specific logs or error messages during installation and seek further assistance from NVIDIA support or user forums."
