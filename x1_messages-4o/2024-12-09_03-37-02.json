I am not sure what the colon (:) inside the parameter means. When I try to run this code in Python 2.7, it results in a syntax error. Is this syntax specific to Python 3? If so, how can I adapt this code to be compatible with Python 2.7?\n\n```python\nclass TextToSpeech:\n    CHUNK = 1024\n\n    def __init__(self, words_pron_dict:str = 'cmudict-0.7b.txt'):\n        self._l = {}\n        self._load_words(words_pron_dict)\n```"

        "content": "The syntax you're seeing in the `__init__` method is known as type hinting, which was introduced in Python 3. Type hints provide a way to indicate the expected data type of a parameter or return value, but they don't enforce the type at runtime. This syntax is not compatible with Python 2.7, which is why you're encountering a syntax error.\n\nTo adapt this code to be compatible with Python 2.7, you need to remove the type hint. Here is how you can modify the `__init__` method:\n\n```python\nclass TextToSpeech:\n    CHUNK = 1024\n\n    def __init__(self, words_pron_dict='cmudict-0.7b.txt'):\n        self._l = {}\n        self._load_words(words_pron_dict)\n```\n\nBy removing `:str` from the parameter, the code should work in Python 2.7 without syntax errors. Keep in mind that while Python 2.7 does not support type hints, you can still include comments or documentation to indicate the expected type of parameters and return values for developers who might be reading your code."
