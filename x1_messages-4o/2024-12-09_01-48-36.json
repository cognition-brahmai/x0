I'm trying to test a file called \"point.py\" with a test file called \"point_test.py\". However, despite my efforts, I keep encountering the same issue. I have attempted to troubleshoot the issue by checking my run configuration but I'm still not entirely sure what's wrong. Could it be something wrong with my run configuration? Here are the contents of my \"point_test.py\" and \"point.py\" files:\n\n\"point_test.py\" :\n```python\nimport unittest\nimport sys\nimport os\n\nsys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('..'))\n\nfrom ..point import Point\n\n\nclass TestPoint(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        pass\n\n    def xyCheck(self,x,y):\n        point = Point(x,y)\n        self.assertEqual(x,point.x)\n        self.assertEqual(y,point.y)\n```\n\n\"point.py\":\n```python\nimport unittest\n\nfrom .utils import check_coincident, shift_point\n\nclass Point(object):\n    def __init__(self,x,y,mark={}):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n        self.mark = mark\n\n    def patched_coincident(self,point2):\n        point1 = (self.x,self.y)\n        return check_coincident(point1,point2)\n\n    def patched_shift(self,x_shift,y_shift):\n        point = (self.x,self.y)\n        self.x,self,y = shift_point(point,x_shift,y_shift)\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with the \"No tests were found\" error in PyCharm when running your `point_test.py` file can be attributed to a few potential problems. Let's address each one and see if we can resolve it:\n\n1. **Incorrect Import Path**: \n   - In your `point_test.py`, you are importing `Point` using `from ..point import Point`. This import statement assumes that `point.py` is in a parent directory. If `point.py` is in the same directory as `point_test.py`, you should change the import to `from point import Point`.\n\n2. **Test Discovery**:\n   - Make sure your test methods in `TestPoint` class start with the prefix `test_`. This is important because `unittest` framework discovers test methods by looking for this prefix. For example, rename `xyCheck` to `test_xyCheck`.\n\n3. **Run Configuration**:\n   - Ensure that your run configuration is set up to run as a Python unit test. You can do this by right-clicking your `point_test.py` file in PyCharm and selecting \"Run 'Unittests in point_test'\".\n\n4. **Directory Structure**:\n   - Ensure your directory structure is set up correctly. If you have a package, make sure there is an `__init__.py` file in the directory where `point.py` and `point_test.py` reside. This can help with module imports.\n\n5. **Check for Errors in `point.py`**:\n   - You have a small error in your `patched_shift` method in `point.py`. The line `self.x,self,y = shift_point(point,x_shift,y_shift)` should be `self.x, self.y = shift_point(point, x_shift, y_shift)`.\n\nHere's how the revised `point_test.py` might look:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\nfrom point import Point  # Adjust import as necessary\n\n\nclass TestPoint(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        pass\n\n    def test_xyCheck(self):\n        x, y = 1, 2\n        point = Point(x, y)\n        self.assertEqual(x, point.x)\n        self.assertEqual(y, point.y)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\nAfter making these changes, try running your tests again. If there are any further issues, ensure that your project interpreter is correctly set up in PyCharm and that all necessary dependencies are installed."
