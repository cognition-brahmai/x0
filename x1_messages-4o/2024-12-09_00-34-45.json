        "content": "Certainly! Renaming a file in an Amazon S3 bucket using Boto3, the AWS SDK for Python, involves copying the object to a new object with the desired name and then deleting the original object. Here's how you can do it step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Boto3\n\nFirst, make sure you have Boto3 installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\npip install boto3\n```\n\n### Step 2: Copy and Delete\n\nHere's a sample Python script to rename an object in an S3 bucket:\n\n```python\nimport boto3\n\ndef rename_s3_object(bucket_name, old_key, new_key):\n    # Initialize a session using your credentials and the desired AWS region\n    s3_client = boto3.client('s3')\n\n    # Copy the object to the new key\n    try:\n        s3_client.copy_object(\n            Bucket=bucket_name,\n            CopySource={'Bucket': bucket_name, 'Key': old_key},\n            Key=new_key\n        )\n        print(f'Object copied from {old_key} to {new_key}')\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f'Error copying object: {e}')\n        return\n\n    # Delete the original object\n    try:\n        s3_client.delete_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=old_key)\n        print(f'Original object {old_key} deleted')\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f'Error deleting original object: {e}')\n\n# Example usage\nbucket_name = 'your-bucket-name'\nold_key = 'path/to/old-object-name'\nnew_key = 'path/to/new-object-name'\n\nrename_s3_object(bucket_name, old_key, new_key)\n```\n\n### Explanation of Arguments\n\n1. **`bucket_name`**: The name of your S3 bucket where the object is stored.\n\n2. **`old_key`**: The key (path) of the object you want to rename.\n\n3. **`new_key`**: The new key (path) for the renamed object.\n\n4. **`s3_client.copy_object()`**:\n   - **`Bucket`**: The destination bucket name (same as source in this case).\n   - **`CopySource`**: A dictionary specifying the source bucket and key.\n   - **`Key`**: The key for the new object.\n\n5. **`s3_client.delete_object()`**:\n   - **`Bucket`**: The bucket name where the object is to be deleted.\n   - **`Key`**: The key of the object to delete.\n\nThis script will copy the object to a new location and then delete the original object, effectively renaming it. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to perform these operations in your S3 bucket."
