I was following the example provided in the Celery documentation [here](http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/django/first-steps-with-django.html). After updating Celery and adding the file from the example, Django is throwing an ImportError: cannot import name Celery. \n\nAll my tasks are in files called tasks.py, and they all have the following import:\n\n```python\nfrom cloud.celery import app\n```\n\nHere's what the cloud/celery.py file looks like:\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import absolute_import\n\nimport os, sys\nfrom celery import Celery\nfrom celery.schedules import crontab\nfrom django.conf import settings\n\nBROKER_URL = 'redis://:PASSWORD@localhost'\n\nos.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'cloud.settings')\napp = Celery('cloud', broker=BROKER_URL)\napp.config_from_object('django.conf:settings')\napp.autodiscover_tasks(settings.INSTALLED_APPS, related_name='tasks')\n\nif \"test\" in sys.argv:\n    app.conf.update(\n        CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER=True,\n    )\n    print &gt;&gt; sys.stderr, 'CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER = True'\n\nCELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE = {\n    'test_rabbit_running': {\n        \"task\": \"retail.tasks.test_rabbit_running\",\n        \"schedule\": 3600, #every hour\n    },\n    [..]\n\napp.conf.update(\n    CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE=CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULE\n)\n```\n\nAnd here's what a typical tasks.py file (like retail/tasks.py) looks like:\n\n```python\nfrom cloud.celery import app\n\nimport logging\nfrom celery.utils.log import get_task_logger\nlogger = get_task_logger('tasks')\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\n@app.task\ndef test_rabbit_running():\n    import datetime\n    utcnow = datetime.datetime.now()\n    logger.info('CELERY RUNNING')\n```\n\nThe error occurs when I try to access a URL that is not valid, like /foobar. Could the problem possibly be caused by the following line in cloud/celery.py?\n\n```python\napp.autodiscover_tasks(settings.INSTALLED_APPS, related_name='tasks')\n```\n\nHere is the full traceback:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/opt/virtenvs/django_slice/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/gunicorn/workers/sync.py\", line 126, in handle_request\n    respiter = self.wsgi(environ, resp.start_response)\n  File \"/opt/virtenvs/django_slice/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/core/handlers/wsgi.py\", line 255, in __call__\n    response = self.get_response(request)\n  File \"/opt/virtenvs/django_slice/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/core/handlers/base.py\", line 178, in get_response\n    response = self.handle_uncaught_exception(request, resolver, sys.exc_info())\n  File \"/opt/virtenvs/django_slice/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/core/handlers/base.py\", line 220, in handle_uncaught_exception\n    if resolver.urlconf_module is None:\n  File \"/opt/virtenvs/django_slice/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/core/urlresolvers.py\", line 342, in urlconf_module\n    self._urlconf_module = import_module(self.urlconf_name)\n  File \"/opt/virtenvs/django_slice/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/utils/importlib.py\", line 35, in import_module\n    __import__(name)\n  File \"/opt/src/slicephone/cloud/cloud/urls.py\", line 52, in \n    urlpatterns +=  patterns('', url(r'^search/', include('search.urls')))\n  File \"/opt/virtenvs/django_slice/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/conf/urls/__init__.py\", line 25, in include\n    urlconf_module = import_module(urlconf_module)\n  File \"/opt/virtenvs/django_slice/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/utils/importlib.py\", line 35, in import_module\n    __import__(name)\n  File \"/opt/src/slicephone/cloud/search/urls.py\", line 5, in \n    from handlers import SearchHandler\n  File \"/opt/src/slicephone/cloud/search/handlers.py\", line 15, in \n    from places import handlers as placeshandler\n  File \"/opt/src/slicephone/cloud/places/handlers.py\", line 23, in \n    import api as placesapi\n  File \"/opt/src/slicephone/cloud/places/api.py\", line 9, in \n    from djapi import *\n  File \"/opt/src/slicephone/cloud/places/djapi.py\", line 26, in \n    from tasks import add_single_place, add_multiple_places\n  File \"/opt/src/slicephone/cloud/places/tasks.py\", line 2, in \n    from cloud.celery import app\n  File \"/opt/src/slicephone/cloud/cloud/celery.py\", line 4, in \n    from celery import Celery\n  File \"/opt/src/slicephone/cloud/cloud/celery.py\", line 4, in \n    from celery import Celery\nImportError: cannot import name Celery\n```\n\nHow can I fix this?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering, `ImportError: cannot import name Celery`, suggests that there might be a circular import problem or a misconfiguration in your setup. Here are a few steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Celery is Installed**: First, confirm that Celery is installed in your environment. You can do this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip show celery\n   ```\n\n   If it's not installed, you can add it using:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install celery\n   ```\n\n2. **Check for Circular Imports**: The error might be due to a circular import between your modules. Make sure there are no imports that could cause such a situation. Given your traceback, it seems like the circular import might be linked to the import statement in `cloud/places/tasks.py`:\n\n   ```python\n   from cloud.celery import app\n   ```\n\n   Try restructuring your imports to avoid circular dependencies. For example, move the import statement inside the function where it is used, or refactor your code to avoid circular references.\n\n3. **Celery Module Confusion**: Ensure that there is no file or module named `celery.py` in your project that could be conflicting with the Celery package. If you have a file named `celery.py` in your project, it might shadow the Celery library. You can rename your project file to something like `celery_app.py` and update imports accordingly:\n\n   ```python\n   from cloud.celery_app import app\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify Python Path**: Check your Python path to ensure that there are no conflicts with the Celery module. You can print out the paths using:\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   print(sys.path)\n   ```\n\n   Make sure there\u2019s nothing unexpected in the path that could be causing import issues.\n\n5. **Configuration Settings**: Verify that your Celery settings are correctly configured. The use of `related_name` in `app.autodiscover_tasks` should match your Django application structure. Also, consider using the modern Celery configuration style:\n\n   ```python\n   app.config_from_object('django.conf:settings', namespace='CELERY')\n   ```\n\n   This way, you can prefix all your Celery settings with `CELERY_` in your Django settings file.\n\n6. **Test Environment Flag**: If you are running tests and the error occurs, ensure that your test configuration (e.g., `CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER`) is correctly set. The syntax for printing to `sys.stderr` is incorrect in Python 3; it should be:\n\n   ```python\n   print('CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER = True', file=sys.stderr)\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps and restructuring your code as needed, you should be able to resolve the import error. If the problem persists, it might be helpful to isolate the issue by creating a minimal example that replicates the error, which can help pinpoint exactly where the import conflict or misconfiguration is occurring."
