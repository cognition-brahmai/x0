For example, in C, I can write a function to return the minimum of two numbers like this:\n\n```c\nint minn(int n, int m){\n return (n<m)? n:m\n}\n```\n\nHowever, when I try to do the same thing in Python:\n\n```python\ndef minn(n,m):\n    return n if n<m else return m\n```\n\nI get a syntax error. I know that I can use the built-in `min()` function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef minn(n,m):\n    return min(n,m)\n```\n\nBut I want to know if I can use a ternary operator in Python to achieve the same result."

        "content": "Certainly! In Python, you can use the ternary conditional operator, but its syntax is slightly different from C. The correct way to use it in your example would be:\n\n```python\ndef minn(n, m):\n    return n if n < m else m\n```\n\nIn this syntax, the condition (`n < m`) is placed in the middle, and the two possible return values (`n` and `m`) are on either side of the condition. If the condition is true, the expression before `if` is returned; otherwise, the expression after `else` is returned.\n\nYour original attempt was almost correct, but you included an extra `return` keyword after `else`, which is unnecessary and causes a syntax error. Just follow the format shown above, and it will work as expected."
