For instance, in the code below, I'd like to be able to access the name of the current executing module (in this case \"bar\") from inside the \"foo\" module. The `__name__` attribute is not suitable as it only returns the name of the module that contains the function. I thought the `inspect` module could help but it's not providing the functionality I require. Is there a global or environment-level variable I can access to get this information? \n\n```python\n# foo.py\ndef f():\n    print __name__\n\n# bar.py\nfrom foo import f\n\ndef b(): f()\n```\n\nAlso, as a use case, I have two Django applications, \"AppOne\" and \"AppTwo\", that need to log errors to files. I'd like to create a directory under `app_logs` using the name of the current application. I thought the best way to do this would be for the logger module to access a global variable that denotes the current application's name, as it is responsible for knowing the location of the parent logging directory and creating the application's logging directory if it doesn't yet exist. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To dynamically access the name of the current executing module or class in Python, you can use the `inspect` module to examine the call stack. This allows you to identify the module from which a function was called. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n### Accessing the Current Executing Module\n\nYou can use the `inspect` module to get the caller's module. Here's an example of how you might modify your `foo.py` to print the name of the module that called it:\n\n```python\n# foo.py\nimport inspect\n\ndef f():\n    # Get the current stack frame\n    current_frame = inspect.currentframe()\n    # Get the caller's frame\n    caller_frame = inspect.getouterframes(current_frame, 2)\n    # The module name is in the filename of the caller's frame\n    module_name = caller_frame[1].filename.split('/')[-1].split('.')[0]\n    print(module_name)\n```\n\nIn `bar.py`, when you call `f()`, it should print `bar`.\n\n```python\n# bar.py\nfrom foo import f\n\ndef b():\n    f()\n\nb()\n```\n\n### Logging in Django Applications\n\nFor your Django use case, you can use a similar approach to determine the name of the application. However, a more Django-centric way would be to use Django settings or middleware to determine the current application. Below is a general approach using the `inspect` module:\n\n1. **Determine the Current Application Name:**\n\n   You can use a similar approach as above to determine the current module and map it to your application name. However, if your applications are structured, you might have a more robust way to determine the application name.\n\n2. **Set Up Logging:**\n\n   You can configure logging in Django by modifying the settings file. Here's a basic example:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   import inspect\n\n   BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))\n\n   def get_current_app_name():\n       current_frame = inspect.currentframe()\n       caller_frame = inspect.getouterframes(current_frame, 2)\n       module_name = caller_frame[1].filename.split('/')[-1].split('.')[0]\n       return module_name\n\n   LOGGING = {\n       'version': 1,\n       'disable_existing_loggers': False,\n       'handlers': {\n           'file': {\n               'level': 'DEBUG',\n               'class': 'logging.FileHandler',\n               'filename': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'app_logs', f'{get_current_app_name()}.log'),\n           },\n       },\n       'loggers': {\n           'django': {\n               'handlers': ['file'],\n               'level': 'DEBUG',\n               'propagate': True,\n           },\n       },\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Ensure that `app_logs` directory exists and is writable by your Django application.\n\n### Note:\n\n- The `inspect` module can be slow, and using it extensively in a performance-critical application may not be advisable.\n- This approach assumes a certain structure in your project. You may need to adapt the path and module name extraction logic to fit your project's structure.\n- In Django, using middleware or settings to pass application-specific configurations might be a more maintainable approach."
