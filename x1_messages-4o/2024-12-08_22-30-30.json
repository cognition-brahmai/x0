Please include a step-by-step explanation of how the algorithm works and provide insights into its time complexity, space complexity, and the optimal substructure property. It would also be helpful if you could provide a code implementation in an excel table format.\nHere's the input:\n|   |   | X | A | M | I | N |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|   | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| A | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| X | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| M | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 |\n| U | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 |\n| N | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 |\nTo solve the longest common subsequence problem for the strings \"AXMIN\" and \"AUMN\", we first create a matrix with the lengths of the longest common subsequences for each combination of characters in the two strings. The first row and column of the matrix are initialized to 0.\nThen, we iterate over each character in the two strings and compare them. If they are the same, we add 1 to the value in the matrix that is diagonal to the current position. If they are different, we take the maximum of the value to the left and the value above the current position.\nFinally, the length of the longest common subsequence is the value in the bottom-right corner of the matrix. \nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(mn), where m and n are the lengths of the two strings. The space complexity is also O(mn), since we need to store the matrix. The optimal substructure property of this problem comes from the fact that the longest common subsequence of two strings is the combination of the longest common subsequences of their prefixes. \nHere's the code implementation in excel table format: \n|          |   | X | A | M | I | N |\n|----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|          | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| A        | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| X        | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| M        | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 |\n| **U**    | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 |\n| N        | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 |"

        "content": "Certainly! Let's delve into the dynamic programming approach to solve the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem for the given strings \"AXMIN\" and \"AUMN\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - Create a 2D matrix `dp` with dimensions `(m+1) x (n+1)` where `m` and `n` are the lengths of strings \"AXMIN\" and \"AUMN\", respectively. \n   - Initialize the first row and first column of the matrix with zeros. This represents the base case where one of the strings is empty, resulting in an LCS of zero length.\n\n2. **Filling the Matrix**:\n   - Iterate over each character of the two strings.\n   - For characters at positions `i` in \"AXMIN\" and `j` in \"AUMN\":\n     - If characters match (`X[i-1] == Y[j-1]`), set `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`.\n     - If characters don't match, set `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.\n\n3. **Result**:\n   - The length of the longest common subsequence is found at `dp[m][n]`.\n\n### Time and Space Complexity:\n- **Time Complexity**: \\(O(m \\times n)\\), where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the two input strings.\n- **Space Complexity**: \\(O(m \\times n)\\), due to the storage of the DP matrix.\n\n### Optimal Substructure:\n- The problem exhibits the optimal substructure property as the solution to a problem can be constructed efficiently from solutions to its subproblems.\n\n### LCS Matrix Representation in Excel Table Format:\n\nBelow is the matrix representation in an Excel-like format:\n\n|   |   | A | U | M | N |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|   | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| A | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| X | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| M | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 |\n| I | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 |\n| N | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 |\n\nHere's how the matrix is filled:\n- Start with all zeros.\n- Compare characters from both strings, filling the matrix based on matches and mismatches.\n- The bottom-right corner gives the LCS length, which is `3` for this example.\n\nThe longest common subsequence for \"AXMIN\" and \"AUMN\" is \"AMN\".\n\nThis representation and explanation should give you a clear understanding of how the dynamic programming approach works for solving the LCS problem."
