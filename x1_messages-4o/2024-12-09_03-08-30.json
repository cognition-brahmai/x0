        "content": "The issue you're encountering is not specific to Python's `append()` implementation. Instead, it's related to how the `append()` method works in Python.\n\nThe `append()` method in Python modifies the list in place and returns `None`. This means it updates the list by adding the specified element to the end, but does not return the updated list itself. Therefore, when you use `print(list.append(4))`, it prints `None` because that's what `append()` returns.\n\nTo fix your code, you should first append the value to the list and then print the list separately. Here's how you can do that:\n\n```python\nmy_list = []  # Assume this is your list\nmy_list.append(4)  # Append the value 4 to the list\nprint(my_list)  # Print the updated list\n```\n\nThis will correctly append the value `4` to the list and print the updated list."
