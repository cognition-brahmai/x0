I need to return a DataFrame, after some data cleaning, like this one:\n\n```\nCategory (index)| size| sum| mean | std\n----------------------------------------\n```\n\nWhere \"size\" is the number of items in each Category and \"sum\", \"mean\" and \"std\" are related to the same functions applied to the 3 shops. How can I perform these operations using the split-apply-combine pattern (groupby, aggregate, apply,...) ?"

        "content": "To perform multiple aggregation functions on a pandas DataFrame grouped by the \"Category\" column, you can use the `groupby` method along with `agg` to apply multiple aggregation functions. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'Item': ['Shoes', 'TV', 'Book', 'phone'],\n    'shop1': [45, 200, 20, 300],\n    'shop2': [50, 300, 17, 350],\n    'shop3': [53, 250, 21, 400],\n    'Category': ['Clothes', 'Technology', 'Books', 'Technology']\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Group by 'Category' and perform aggregations\nresult = df.groupby('Category').agg(\n    size=('Item', 'size'),  # Count of items in each category\n    sum=('shop1', 'sum'),   # Sum of shop1 prices (you can adjust to sum all shops)\n    mean=('shop1', 'mean'), # Mean of shop1 prices (you can adjust to mean of all shops)\n    std=('shop1', 'std')    # Std deviation of shop1 prices (you can adjust to std of all shops)\n)\n\n# To calculate sum, mean, and std for all shops together\n# First, let's create a new column to store the total cost across all shops\ndf['total_cost'] = df[['shop1', 'shop2', 'shop3']].sum(axis=1)\n\n# Now group by and aggregate\nresult = df.groupby('Category').agg(\n    size=('Item', 'size'),\n    sum=('total_cost', 'sum'),\n    mean=('total_cost', 'mean'),\n    std=('total_cost', 'std')\n)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code first creates a DataFrame and then groups it by the \"Category\" column. It calculates the `size`, `sum`, `mean`, and `std` using the `agg` function. We're also summing the costs across all shops for each item to get the total cost, then using this total to compute the `sum`, `mean`, and `std` for each category. Adjust the aggregation functions and columns as needed to match your specific requirements."
