        "content": "To load a C# DLL in Python without using IronPython, you can use Python for .NET, commonly known as `pythonnet`. This library allows you to interoperate with .NET assemblies. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can achieve this:\n\n### Step 1: Install pythonnet\n\nFirst, you need to install the `pythonnet` package. You can do this using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install pythonnet\n```\n\n### Step 2: Prepare Your C# DLL\n\nEnsure your C# project is compiled into a DLL. If you haven't already done so, compile your C# code into a class library. You don't need to write any additional code for exporting like in C++.\n\n### Step 3: Use pythonnet in Python\n\nHere's a simple example of how you can load and use a C# DLL in Python:\n\n1. **Import the CLR module:**\n\n   ```python\n   import clr\n   ```\n\n2. **Add the path to your DLL:**\n\n   You need to provide the path to the directory where your DLL is located. If your DLL is in the current directory, you can add it like this:\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   sys.path.append(r'path\\to\\your\\dll')\n   ```\n\n3. **Load the assembly:**\n\n   Use the `clr` module to load your C# DLL:\n\n   ```python\n   clr.AddReference('YourAssemblyName')  # Use the name of your C# assembly without the .dll extension\n   ```\n\n4. **Import and use the C# classes:**\n\n   Once the assembly is loaded, you can import and use its classes just like you would in C#:\n\n   ```python\n   from YourNamespace import YourClass\n\n   obj = YourClass()\n   result = obj.YourMethod()\n   print(result)\n   ```\n\n### Example\n\nSuppose you have a C# DLL named `MathLibrary.dll` with a namespace `MathLibrary` and a class `Calculator` with a method `Add`:\n\n```csharp\nnamespace MathLibrary\n{\n    public class Calculator\n    {\n        public int Add(int a, int b)\n        {\n            return a + b;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can use it in Python as follows:\n\n```python\nimport clr\nimport sys\n\n# Add the directory containing your DLL to sys.path\nsys.path.append(r'C:\\path\\to\\your\\dll')\n\n# Load the assembly\nclr.AddReference('MathLibrary')\n\n# Import the namespace and use the class\nfrom MathLibrary import Calculator\n\ncalc = Calculator()\nresult = calc.Add(5, 7)\nprint(\"The result is:\", result)\n```\n\nThis approach allows you to leverage existing C# libraries in your Python projects without needing to modify the C# code specifically for Python interoperability."
