This method splits the string at each occurrence of the specified delimiter and returns a list of substrings. Here's how you can use it to extract the value on the left side of the underscore from the string \"2.7.0_bf4fda703454\":\n\n```python\n# Original string\noriginal_string = \"2.7.0_bf4fda703454\"\n\n# Split the string using the underscore as the delimiter\nparts = original_string.split(\"_\")\n\n# Extract the value on the left side of the underscore\nleft_side_value = parts[0]\n\nprint(left_side_value)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\n2.7.0\n```\n\nThis code splits the string into parts based on the underscore and retrieves the first part, which is the value on the left side of the underscore."
