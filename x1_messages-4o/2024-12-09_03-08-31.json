        "content": "To obtain the size of an image (its width and height) using the Python Imaging Library (PIL), you can use the `Pillow` library, which is the modern fork of PIL. Here's a simple example of how you can do this:\n\nFirst, make sure you have the Pillow library installed. You can install it using pip if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\npip install Pillow\n```\n\nOnce you have Pillow installed, you can use the following code to get the size of an image:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\n\n# Open the image file\nwith Image.open('path/to/your/image.jpg') as img:\n    # Get the dimensions\n    width, height = img.size\n\nprint(f\"Width: {width}\")\nprint(f\"Height: {height}\")\n```\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of the code:\n\n1. **Import the Image module**: This module is part of the Pillow library and is used to work with images.\n\n2. **Open the image file**: Use the `Image.open()` function to open the image file. Make sure to replace `'path/to/your/image.jpg'` with the actual path to your image file.\n\n3. **Get the size**: The `size` attribute of the image object returns a tuple containing the width and height of the image.\n\n4. **Print the dimensions**: Finally, you can print out the width and height to see the image's size.\n\nThis method works for various image formats supported by Pillow, including JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and many others.
