I've split my data into training and validation sets using an 80-20 split with sklearn's `train_test_split()`. However, when I execute `model.fit(X_train, y_train, validation_data=[X_val, y_val])`, it shows zero validation loss and accuracy for all epochs, even though the model is training correctly. When I evaluate the model on the validation set, the output is non-zero. Why am I seeing zero loss and zero accuracy for validation? Here is my complete sample code: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1P8iCUlnD87vqtuS5YTdoePcDOVEKpBHr?usp=sharing"

        "content": "There could be a few reasons why you're seeing zero validation loss and accuracy during training, even though the evaluation on the validation set shows non-zero values. Here are some potential causes and solutions you can check:\n\n1. **Data Mismatch**: Ensure that the `X_val` and `y_val` variables indeed contain the validation data, and there's no mix-up with training data. Double-check your `train_test_split()` call to confirm the correct data is being used.\n\n2. **Data Preprocessing**: Verify that the preprocessing applied to the training data is also applied to the validation data. Any difference in preprocessing can lead to discrepancies in model performance.\n\n3. **Model Compilation**: Ensure that the model is compiled with appropriate loss and metrics. For binary classification, you should use binary cross-entropy loss and binary accuracy:\n\n   ```python\n   model.compile(optimizer='adam', \n                 loss='binary_crossentropy', \n                 metrics=['accuracy'])\n   ```\n\n4. **Validation Data Format**: Ensure that the validation data passed to `model.fit()` is in the correct format. It should be a tuple or a list of `(X_val, y_val)`.\n\n5. **Batch Size and Steps**: Check if you have specified any custom batch size or steps that might affect validation computation. If the batch size doesn't divide the validation set perfectly, it can cause issues.\n\n6. **Logging**: Sometimes, logging issues can prevent the correct display of metrics. Make sure your logging to the console is appropriate and not overridden by any custom callbacks that might suppress output.\n\n7. **Callback Interference**: If you are using any callbacks, such as `EarlyStopping`, `ModelCheckpoint`, or custom ones, ensure they are not interfering with the validation data processing.\n\n8. **TensorFlow/Keras Version**: Occasionally, version mismatches between TensorFlow and Keras can cause unexpected behavior. Make sure you\u2019re using compatible versions.\n\n9. **Colab Issue**: If you're running this on Colab, try restarting the runtime and running all cells again. Sometimes, Colab environments can have transient issues.\n\nIf none of these solutions resolve your issue, it would be beneficial to check for any warnings or errors in the console that might hint at the underlying problem. Additionally, reviewing the specific lines of code dealing with data handling and model configuration might reveal any subtle issues."
