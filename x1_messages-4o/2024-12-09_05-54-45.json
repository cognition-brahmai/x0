        "content": "When you build a Docker image, Docker caches each step of the Dockerfile. If a step hasn't changed, Docker uses the cached version. This means that if your `git clone` command doesn't seem to run again, it's because it's being cached. To ensure that you always get the latest code from your repository, you can break the cache using a few strategies:\n\n### 1. Use a Build Argument\nYou can use a build argument to invalidate the cache. This can be a simple timestamp or a commit hash.\n\nFirst, modify your Dockerfile to accept a build argument:\n\n```dockerfile\nARG CACHEBUST=1\n\n# Other Dockerfile instructions...\n\nRUN git clone git@bitbucket.org/{user}/{repo}\n```\n\nThen, when you build the image, pass in a unique value for the `CACHEBUST` argument each time:\n\n```bash\ndocker build --build-arg CACHEBUST=$(date +%s) -t dockerhubaccount/demo:v1 .\n```\n\nThis unique value will force Docker to rerun the `git clone` command.\n\n### 2. Use a `.dockerignore` file\nEnsure that your `.dockerignore` file does not ignore files that should invalidate the cache. However, this is more relevant for files in your build context rather than the `git clone` command directly.\n\n### 3. Separate Cloning and Building\nConsider separating the code cloning process from the Docker build. You can clone your code on the host machine and then copy it into the Docker image. This approach gives you more control over when and how the code is updated.\n\nModify your Dockerfile like this:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM ubuntu:latest\nMAINTAINER { myname }\n\n# Install dependencies\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \\\n    tar git curl dialog wget net-tools nano build-essential \\\n    python python-dev python-distribute python-pip\n\nWORKDIR /opt/app\n\n# Copy the code from the host to the container\nCOPY . /opt/app\n\nRUN pip install -r website/requirements.txt\n\n# Expose the port and run the server\nEXPOSE 8000\nCMD [\"python\", \"website/manage.py\", \"runserver\", \"0.0.0.0:8000\"]\n```\n\nThen, before building the Docker image, clone the repository on your host machine:\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@bitbucket.org/{user}/{repo} /path/to/local/repo\ncd /path/to/local/repo\ndocker build -t dockerhubaccount/demo:v1 .\n```\n\n### 4. CI/CD Workflow\nIn a CI/CD workflow, you typically have a pipeline that rebuilds your Docker image whenever there is a new commit to your repository. You can configure your CI/CD tool to automatically clone the latest code and build the image. Tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or Bitbucket Pipelines can help automate this process.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy adopting these strategies, you can ensure that your Docker builds always use the latest version of your code. Depending on your specific needs, you may choose one or a combination of these approaches to fit your workflow."
