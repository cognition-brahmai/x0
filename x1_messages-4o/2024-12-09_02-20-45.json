I am trying to use gdb to debug a complex issue involving cpu overuse during my Python program execution. I have followed the official Python documentation on gdb extension, which advised me to add \"add-auto-load-safe-path /path/to/dir/with/python-gdb.py\" to ~/.gdbinit. After doing this, I tested it with \"gdb --args /path/to/python3.5/binary\" and then \"py-bt\". Unfortunately, I am getting an \"Undefined command: \"py-bt\"\" error. I am currently using gdb version 7.2 with Python support enabled. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with the \"Undefined command: 'py-bt'\" error in gdb usually arises from the Python-specific gdb extensions not being properly loaded or configured. Here are a few steps to help you troubleshoot and resolve this problem:\n\n1. **Verify Python Support in GDB:**\n   Make sure that your gdb version has Python scripting support enabled. You can verify this by running `gdb` and then executing the command `python` inside gdb. If you get a Python prompt, then Python scripting is enabled.\n\n2. **Check Python-GDB.py Path:**\n   Ensure that the path specified in your `~/.gdbinit` file is correct and points to the directory containing `python-gdb.py`. This file is usually located in the `Tools/gdb` directory of the Python source code if you compiled Python from source.\n\n3. **Permissions and Ownership:**\n   Make sure that the `python-gdb.py` file has the correct permissions set, and that gdb has permission to read it. You can check and modify the permissions using `chmod` if necessary.\n\n4. **Environment Variables:**\n   Ensure that your environment variables are set correctly. The `PYTHONPATH` should include any directories that contain Python modules you are trying to debug.\n\n5. **GDB Init Configuration:**\n   Double-check your `~/.gdbinit` file to ensure that the `add-auto-load-safe-path` line is correctly formatted and points to the right directory. It should look like:\n   ```\n   add-auto-load-safe-path /path/to/dir/with\n   ```\n\n6. **Reinstall or Rebuild GDB:**\n   If the above steps don't solve the issue, consider reinstalling or rebuilding gdb with explicit Python support. Sometimes, there might be an issue with the way gdb was compiled or installed.\n\n7. **Try a Newer Version of GDB:**\n   Since you are using gdb version 7.2, consider upgrading to a newer version if possible. Newer versions may have better support and more features, which can help with debugging.\n\n8. **Testing with a Simple Python Script:**\n   Create a simple Python script to test whether the gdb extensions are working. This can help you determine if the problem is specific to your complex script or a more general issue with the setup.\n\n9. **Consult Official Documentation:**\n   Refer back to the official Python documentation for any additional configuration steps that might be needed for your specific version of Python and gdb.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue with the `py-bt` command in gdb."
