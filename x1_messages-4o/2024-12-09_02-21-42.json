        "content": "In Python, when you raise an exception, it must be an instance of a class that derives from `BaseException`, not a string. The error you're encountering is because you're trying to raise a string, which is not a valid exception type.\n\nTo fix this, you need to raise an instance of an exception class. For example, you could use the built-in `Exception` class or any of its subclasses. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\ntest = 'abc'\nif True:\n    raise Exception(test + 'def')\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, `test + 'def'` becomes the message passed to the `Exception` constructor, and you're raising an actual exception object. This will prevent the `TypeError` you encountered."
