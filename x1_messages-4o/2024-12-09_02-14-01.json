I have come across a few decorators that implement dynamic checks based on function parameter and return type annotations but I am in search of a more robust tool that can perform checks at compile-time. Can anyone recommend any available tools that can assist with this? For instance, I'd like to be able to annotate a function such as the following:\n\n```python\ndef put(d, k, v):\n   d[k] = v\n```\n\nI want to denote the `put` function as having type `put<K,V>(dict<K,V>, K, V) -> None`. I am aware of compilers and type checking and I am willing to enhance an incomplete tool if it has a good foundation."

        "content": "Incorporating type annotations into a Python codebase is a great way to enhance code readability and enable static type checking. Python's type hints, introduced in PEP 484, provide a way to specify the expected types of function arguments and return values, and tools like `mypy` can be used to perform static type checking based on these annotations.\n\nFor your `put` function, you can use Python's generic type annotations from the `typing` module to express the types of the dictionary keys and values. Here\u2019s how you can annotate your `put` function:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Dict, TypeVar\n\nK = TypeVar('K')\nV = TypeVar('V')\n\ndef put(d: Dict[K, V], k: K, v: V) -> None:\n    d[k] = v\n```\n\nIn this example, `TypeVar` is used to define generic types `K` and `V`, which can be any type. `Dict[K, V]` specifies a dictionary with keys of type `K` and values of type `V`.\n\nTo perform static type checking, you can use `mypy`, a popular type checker for Python. You can install it via pip:\n\n```bash\npip install mypy\n```\n\nOnce installed, you can run `mypy` on your Python files to check for type errors:\n\n```bash\nmypy your_script.py\n```\n\n`mypy` will analyze your code based on the type annotations and report any type inconsistencies it finds.\n\nBeyond `mypy`, there are other tools and linters like `pyright` (from Microsoft) and `pyre-check` (from Facebook) that also provide static type checking capabilities. Each of these tools has its own strengths, so you might want to try a few to see which one fits best with your workflow.\n\nIf you're interested in enhancing an incomplete tool, these open-source projects often welcome contributions, and you can find their repositories on platforms like GitHub. This could be a great way to contribute to the Python community while also tailoring the tool to better meet your needs."
