        "content": "Welcome to the Genetic Disorder Prediction Challenge! As a genetic researcher, you have collected data on 100 patients with a rare genetic disorder, and now it's time to put your skills to the test.\nHere's what you need to do: Using the genetic markers in the table below, create a formula that will help you predict whether or not each patient will develop the disorder. Remember, each marker is either positive (\"P\") or negative (\"N\").\nBut wait, there's a catch! To make things more interesting, you can only use the following mathematical operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). And you can only use each operation once.\nHere are the rules for predicting the onset of the disorder based on the genetic markers:\n- If at least two of the markers are positive, the patient will develop the disorder.\n- If only one of the markers is positive, the patient may or may not develop the disorder.\n- If all three markers are negative, the patient will not develop the disorder.\nOnce you have your formula, apply it to the data in the table to predict the onset of the disorder for each patient. Good luck!\nTABLE:\n| Patient | Age | Gender | Marker 1 | Marker 2 | Marker 3 |\n|---------|-----|--------|----------|----------|----------|\n| 1       | 23  | F      | P        | P        | N        |\n| 2       | 34  | M      | N        | P        | P        |\n| 3       | 52  | F      | P        | N        | N        |\n| 4       | 42  | M      | N        | N        | N        |\n| ...     | ... | ...    | ...      | ...      | ...      |\n| 100     | 31  | F      | N        | P        | P        |"

        "content": "To solve this challenge, we need to create a formula using the given operations that helps us predict the onset of the disorder based on the genetic markers. Let's use a simple numerical representation for the markers: we'll assign a value of 1 for a positive marker (\"P\") and a value of 0 for a negative marker (\"N\").\n\nThe goal is to check how many markers are positive for each patient:\n\n1. If the sum of the markers is 2 or more, the patient will develop the disorder.\n2. If the sum is 1, the outcome is uncertain.\n3. If the sum is 0, the patient will not develop the disorder.\n\nHere's how we can break down the problem using the operations only once:\n\nLet's define:\n- \\( M_1, M_2, M_3 \\) as the numeric values of Marker 1, Marker 2, and Marker 3 (1 for \"P\", 0 for \"N\").\n\nWe want to calculate the sum of these markers, but we can only use each operation once. Let's use a creative approach:\n\n1. **Step 1 (Addition):** Add the three markers: \\( \\text{Sum} = M_1 + M_2 + M_3 \\).\n\n2. **Step 2 (Subtraction):** Use subtraction to create a conditional effect. Subtract a value that helps distinguish between the conditions. We can subtract 1, which will give:\n   - If Sum = 3, after subtraction, it becomes 2.\n   - If Sum = 2, after subtraction, it becomes 1.\n   - If Sum = 1, after subtraction, it becomes 0.\n   - If Sum = 0, after subtraction, it becomes -1.\n\n3. **Step 3 (Multiplication):** Multiply the result by 1 to keep it unchanged, as we need to use this operation.\n\n4. **Step 4 (Division):** Divide by 1 to keep it unchanged, as we need to use this operation.\n\nThus, the formula can be represented as:\n\\[ \\text{Result} = \\left( (M_1 + M_2 + M_3) - 1 \\right) \\times 1 / 1 \\]\n\nNow, let's apply this formula to predict the onset of the disorder for a few patients:\n\n- **Patient 1:** Markers are P, P, N \u2192 \\( M_1 = 1, M_2 = 1, M_3 = 0 \\)\n  \\[ \\text{Result} = (1 + 1 + 0 - 1) \\times 1 / 1 = 1 \\]\n  Prediction: The patient will develop the disorder.\n\n- **Patient 2:** Markers are N, P, P \u2192 \\( M_1 = 0, M_2 = 1, M_3 = 1 \\)\n  \\[ \\text{Result} = (0 + 1 + 1 - 1) \\times 1 / 1 = 1 \\]\n  Prediction: The patient will develop the disorder.\n\n- **Patient 3:** Markers are P, N, N \u2192 \\( M_1 = 1, M_2 = 0, M_3 = 0 \\)\n  \\[ \\text{Result} = (1 + 0 + 0 - 1) \\times 1 / 1 = 0 \\]\n  Prediction: The outcome is uncertain.\n\n- **Patient 4:** Markers are N, N, N \u2192 \\( M_1 = 0, M_2 = 0, M_3 = 0 \\)\n  \\[ \\text{Result} = (0 + 0 + 0 - 1) \\times 1 / 1 = -1 \\]\n  Prediction: The patient will not develop the disorder.\n\nThis formula allows us to predict the onset of the disorder in accordance with the rules provided."
