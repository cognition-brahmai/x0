Look for subdirectories like `conf` for default templates and `contrib` for built-in Django applications.\n\n4. **Using `django-admin` command:**\n\n   If you want to know the Django project structure and where manage.py and other components are located, you can use:\n\n   ```bash\n   django-admin startproject myproject\n   ```\n\n   Replace `myproject` with your project's name. This command will create a new directory with the default Django project structure, which you can compare to your existing project.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to locate and explore the default templates and applications provided by Django."
