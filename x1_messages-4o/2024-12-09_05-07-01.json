However, I am having trouble checking if a particular list 'c' in the dictionary is empty. I have tried using '==[]', '==\"[]\"', and checking the length of the list, but none of them seem to work. Here is the code I am working on:\n\n```python\ndef CleanWhiteSpace(theDict):\n    stuff=[]\n\n    for key,value in theDict.items():\n        for d in value:\n            if value != \" \":\n                stuff.append(d)    \n                print d\n                theDict[key]=stuff\n            if not value[d]:\n                print value\n        stuff=[]\n    return theDict\n    print CleanWhiteSpace({'a':['1','2'],'b':['3',' '],'c':[]})\n```\nHow can I check if the list 'c' is empty?"

        "content": "To check if a list is empty in Python, you can simply use an `if not` condition, which evaluates to `True` if the list is empty. In your code, you seem to be checking whether individual elements of `value` are empty, but you want to check if the entire list assigned to a key is empty.\n\nHere's how you can modify your function to properly check if the list is empty:\n\n```python\ndef CleanWhiteSpace(theDict):\n    for key, value in theDict.items():\n        if not value:  # Checks if the list is empty\n            print(f\"List for key '{key}' is empty\")\n        else:\n            # Clean whitespace and update the dictionary\n            cleaned_list = [item.strip() for item in value if item.strip()]\n            theDict[key] = cleaned_list\n\n    return theDict\n\nprint(CleanWhiteSpace({'a': ['1', '2'], 'b': ['3', ' '], 'c': []}))\n```\n\nIn this modified version of the function:\n1. I check if the list `value` is empty with `if not value:`.\n2. If the list is not empty, I use a list comprehension to clean up any whitespace from the elements and remove any empty strings after stripping.\n3. Finally, the cleaned list is assigned back to the dictionary `theDict` for that key.\n\nThis should help you identify and handle empty lists as well as clean up non-empty lists by removing elements that are only whitespace."
