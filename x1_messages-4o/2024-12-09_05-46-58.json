Can someone explain why this is happening?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering arises from the way Python handles method definitions within classes. In Python, when you define a method within a class, the first parameter is always expected to be the instance of the class (commonly named `self`). This parameter allows the method to access and modify the instance's attributes and other methods. \n\nIn your `foodo` method definition, you did not include `self` as the first parameter, which is leading to the `TypeError`. Python is assuming that `thing` is supposed to be the instance (`self`), and when you call the method and pass `thing=\"something\"`, it results in Python receiving multiple values for the `thing` parameter.\n\nHere's how you can fix it:\n\n```python\nclass foo(object):\n    def foodo(self, thing=None, thong='not underwear'):\n        print(thing if thing else \"nothing\")\n        print('a thong is', thong)\n\nmyfoo = foo()\nmyfoo.foodo(thing=\"something\")\n```\n\nBy including `self` as the first parameter in the method definition, the `foodo` method now correctly accepts `self` as the instance of the class, and the `thing` and `thong` arguments will behave as expected."
