However, when I try to use 'time.sleep()' in a loop to update the time, the entire GUI freezes. How can I get the timer or clock to update itself without freezing the GUI?"

        "content": "To update a label or any widget in a Tkinter GUI application without freezing the interface, you should avoid using `time.sleep()` as it blocks the main thread, preventing the GUI from updating. Instead, you can use the `after()` method provided by Tkinter, which allows you to schedule a function to be called after a certain period of time. This method is non-blocking and keeps the GUI responsive.\n\nHere's a simple example of how you could implement a clock in a Tkinter application that updates every second:\n\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef update_clock():\n    # Get the current time\n    now = datetime.now().strftime('%H:%M:%S')\n    \n    # Update the label with the current time\n    time_label.config(text=now)\n    \n    # Schedule the update_clock function to be called again after 1000 milliseconds (1 second)\n    root.after(1000, update_clock)\n\n# Create the main window\nroot = tk.Tk()\nroot.title(\"Clock\")\n\n# Create a label to display the time\ntime_label = tk.Label(root, font=('Helvetica', 48), fg='black')\ntime_label.pack(pady=20)\n\n# Call the update_clock function for the first time\nupdate_clock()\n\n# Start the Tkinter event loop\nroot.mainloop()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`root.after(1000, update_clock)`:** This line schedules the `update_clock` function to be called again after 1000 milliseconds (1 second). This is similar to setting a timer that repeatedly calls the function to update the time displayed.\n\n- **`datetime.now().strftime('%H:%M:%S')`:** This function call gets the current time and formats it as a string in the 'hh:mm:ss' format.\n\n- **`time_label.config(text=now)`:** This updates the label's text to show the current time.\n\nUsing `after()` keeps the GUI responsive because it doesn't block the main loop of the application. Each call to `after()` adds an event to the main event loop, allowing other events (like user inputs) to be processed in between updates."
