However, I'm encountering an exception that says \"TypeError: object MagicMock can't be used in 'await' expression\". The exception arises when I run the following code:\n\n```python\n# source code\nclass Service:\n    async def compute(self, x):\n        return x\n\nclass App:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.service = Service()\n\n    async def handle(self, x):\n        return await self.service.compute(x)\n\n# test code\nimport asyncio\nimport unittest\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\n\nclass TestApp(unittest.TestCase):\n    @patch('__main__.Service')\n    def test_handle(self, mock):\n        loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n        app = App()\n        res = loop.run_until_complete(app.handle('foo'))\n        app.service.compute.assert_called_with(\"foo\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\nCould someone advise how I can fix this error using built-in Python3 libraries?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is because by default, `MagicMock` does not behave like an asynchronous function, which means it can't be awaited. To fix this, you need to ensure the mocked method returns an `Awaitable` object, which can be done using `AsyncMock` in Python 3.8 and later. If you are using an earlier version of Python, you'll need to define a custom async function.\n\nHere's how you can modify your test code to use `AsyncMock`:\n\n```python\n# test code\nimport asyncio\nimport unittest\nfrom unittest.mock import patch, AsyncMock\n\nclass TestApp(unittest.TestCase):\n    @patch('__main__.Service')\n    def test_handle(self, mock_service):\n        # Create an instance of the mock for Service\n        mock_instance = mock_service.return_value\n        \n        # Use AsyncMock for the compute method\n        mock_instance.compute = AsyncMock(return_value='mocked_result')\n\n        loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n        app = App()\n        \n        # Run the handle method and ensure it returns the mocked result\n        res = loop.run_until_complete(app.handle('foo'))\n        self.assertEqual(res, 'mocked_result')\n\n        # Verify that compute was called with the correct argument\n        mock_instance.compute.assert_awaited_with('foo')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **AsyncMock**: This is used to mock asynchronous methods. From Python 3.8 onwards, you can use `AsyncMock` which allows you to directly mock async methods.\n   \n2. **Setting the Return Value**: With `AsyncMock`, you can set the return value just like you would with a regular `Mock`.\n\n3. **assert_awaited_with**: This method is used to assert that the `compute` method was awaited with specific arguments.\n\nIf you are using an older version of Python (before 3.8), you would need to manually create an async function to mock the behavior:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def async_return(value):\n    return value\n\n# In the test\nmock_instance.compute = AsyncMock(side_effect=lambda x: async_return('mocked_result'))\n```\n\nThis way, you ensure your mock behaves like an async function, and the test should pass without the `TypeError`."
