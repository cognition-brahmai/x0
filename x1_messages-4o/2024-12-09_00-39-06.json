For instance, the following paths should all return the filename 'c':\n\n```\na/b/c/\na/b/c\n\\a\\b\\c\n\\a\\b\\c\\\na\\b\\c\na/b/../../a/b/c/\na/b/../../a/b/c\n```\nIs there a Python library that can help me achieve this?"

        "content": "Yes, Python's built-in `os.path` module can help you achieve this. Specifically, you can use the `os.path.basename()` function to extract the filename from a given path. This function handles both forward slashes (`/`) and backward slashes (`\\`) and works across different operating systems.\n\nHere's a small example to demonstrate how you can use `os.path.basename()`:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\npaths = [\n    'a/b/c/',\n    'a/b/c',\n    r'\\a\\b\\c',\n    r'\\a\\b\\c\\\\',\n    r'a\\b\\c',\n    'a/b/../../a/b/c/',\n    'a/b/../../a/b/c'\n]\n\nfor path in paths:\n    # Normalize the path first\n    normalized_path = os.path.normpath(path)\n    # Extract the basename\n    filename = os.path.basename(normalized_path)\n    print(filename)\n```\n\nIn this example, `os.path.normpath()` is used to normalize the path, which handles the redundant separators and up-level references (like `..`). After normalization, `os.path.basename()` is used to extract the filename. This approach should work consistently across different operating systems."
