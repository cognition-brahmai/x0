If you want to hide this section, you can unregister these models from the admin. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Open your admin.py file:** If you don't have an `admin.py` file, create one in any of your apps.\n\n2. **Unregister the models:** You can unregister the `User` and `Group` models provided by Django's auth app.\n\nHere's an example of how you can do this:\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User, Group\n\n# Unregister the User and Group models\nadmin.site.unregister(User)\nadmin.site.unregister(Group)\n```\n\nBy adding this code to your `admin.py`, the \"Auth\" section will be removed from the Django admin interface. If you ever need to bring it back, you can either comment out or remove the lines that unregister the models.\n\nRemember, this approach will remove the ability to manage users and groups through the admin interface, so make sure this aligns with your project's requirements."
