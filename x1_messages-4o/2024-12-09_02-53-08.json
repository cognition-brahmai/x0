I have successfully installed Python 2.7.8 (32-bit), numpy-1.8.1, scipy-0.14.0, and matplotlib-1.3.1. Following this, I installed PIP by running a script and saved it as `C:\\Python27\\Scripts\\pip_install.py`. But when I try to install a matplotlib dependency, python-dateutil, using pip, I get the error \"bash: pip: command not found\". This error persists even from the command prompt. I am not sure if the path where I saved pip_install.py affects this. Furthermore, when I add the pip-path, it does not return any errors but nothing gets installed. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "To resolve the issue you're experiencing with pip on Windows 7 Enterprise while using Python 2.7, let's go through a few steps to ensure everything is set up correctly:\n\n1. **Verify Python Installation**:\n   - Ensure that Python is correctly installed and accessible from the command line. You can check this by opening the Command Prompt and typing:\n     ```\n     python --version\n     ```\n   - This should return the version of Python you have installed (e.g., \"Python 2.7.8\").\n\n2. **Check PIP Installation**:\n   - First, ensure that pip is installed correctly. You can do this by running the command:\n     ```\n     python -m ensurepip\n     ```\n   - If it\u2019s already installed, you can upgrade it using:\n     ```\n     python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n     ```\n\n3. **Add Python and Scripts Directory to PATH**:\n   - Make sure that the Python installation directory and the Scripts directory are added to your system's PATH environment variable. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n     - Right-click on 'Computer' and click on 'Properties'.\n     - Click on 'Advanced system settings'.\n     - Click on 'Environment Variables'.\n     - Under 'System variables', find the variable named `Path`, select it, and click 'Edit'.\n     - Add the path to your Python installation and the Scripts folder. For example:\n       ```\n       C:\\Python27\\;C:\\Python27\\Scripts\\\n       ```\n   - After editing, restart your Command Prompt to ensure the changes take effect.\n\n4. **Verify PIP Command**:\n   - Open a new Command Prompt window and type:\n     ```\n     pip --version\n     ```\n   - This should return the pip version and confirm that pip is accessible from the command line.\n\n5. **Install python-dateutil**:\n   - Now, try installing `python-dateutil` using pip:\n     ```\n     pip install python-dateutil\n     ```\n\n6. **Check for Errors**:\n   - If you still encounter issues, ensure there are no typos in the command and that you have a stable internet connection.\n   - If the problem persists, try downloading the `python-dateutil` wheel file from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/#files) and installing it manually:\n     ```\n     pip install path_to_downloaded_wheel_file.whl\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve any issues related to pip not being found and successfully install the required packages."
