If not, is there any other way to use a single format string or regex to create and parse this?"

However, you can use regular expressions to extract the integer ID from the formatted part number string. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Example formatted part number\nformatted_part_number = 'PN-000123456'\n\n# Regular expression to extract the numeric part\npattern = r'^PN-(\\d{9})$'\n\n# Use re.match to find the numeric part\nmatch = re.match(pattern, formatted_part_number)\nif match:\n    # Extract the integer ID from the matched group\n    part_id = int(match.group(1))\n    print(\"Extracted ID:\", part_id)\nelse:\n    print(\"The formatted part number does not match the expected pattern.\")\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We define a regular expression pattern `r'^PN-(\\d{9})$'` to match the formatted part number. This pattern expects a string that starts with `'PN-'` followed by exactly 9 digits.\n- We use `re.match` to attempt to match the pattern against the `formatted_part_number`.\n- If a match is found, we extract the numeric part using `match.group(1)` and convert it to an integer.\n- If there is no match, it indicates that the formatted part number doesn't follow the expected pattern.\n\nThis approach allows you to both create and parse the part numbers using a defined structure."
