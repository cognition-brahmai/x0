I installed Python using WinPython 32-bit system and MinGW as described on Theano's installation page. After setting up my `.theanorc` file and attempting to import Theano, I receive various errors depending on my configurations. The errors suggest that a supported version of Microsoft Visual Studio cannot be found, that the GPU device is unavailable, and that the namespace \"std\" has no member \"min\". I have both Visual Studio 2010 and 2013 installed on my system. Theano imports without any issues when the GPU option is off, and CUDA samples also run without problems. How can I resolve these issues and successfully import Theano with the GPU option enabled?"

        "content": "Installing Theano with GPU support on Windows, especially on older versions like Windows 8, can be challenging due to compatibility issues with compilers and CUDA. Here are some steps and tips to help resolve the issues you're facing:\n\n1. **CUDA and cuDNN Compatibility:**\n   - Ensure that you have installed a version of CUDA that is compatible with your GPU and with Theano. You can check the compatibility on NVIDIA's website.\n   - Similarly, ensure the correct version of cuDNN is installed, as Theano requires both CUDA and cuDNN for GPU computations.\n\n2. **Microsoft Visual Studio Configuration:**\n   - Theano requires a compatible C/C++ compiler. Since you have Visual Studio 2010 and 2013, ensure that you have installed the C++ build tools for these versions.\n   - Set the environment variable `VS90COMNTOOLS` or `VS120COMNTOOLS` to point to the appropriate version of Visual Studio. You can set these in your system environment variables.\n\n3. **MinGW Configuration:**\n   - Make sure that MinGW is correctly installed and added to your system's PATH. Theano often prefers specific versions of GCC, so you might need to experiment with different MinGW versions.\n   - Ensure that MinGW is set up to use the correct C++ standard library. You might need to adjust your MinGW installation to include a compatible version.\n\n4. **.theanorc File Configuration:**\n   - Double-check your `.theanorc` file for any typos or incorrect configurations. Ensure paths to CUDA and other configurations are correct.\n   - Example configuration might look like this:\n\n     ```ini\n     [global]\n     device = cuda\n     floatX = float32\n\n     [cuda]\n     root = C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\vX.X\n\n     [nvcc]\n     fastmath = True\n     ```\n\n5. **Namespace Errors:**\n   - The error regarding the \"std\" namespace suggests issues with the C++ standard library. Ensure that the correct include paths are set in your compiler settings. This might involve tweaking your compiler settings or environment variables.\n\n6. **Testing with a Different Python Distribution:**\n   - Consider using a different Python distribution that might handle dependencies better, such as Anaconda, which can manage packages and dependencies more smoothly.\n\n7. **Update Theano and Dependencies:**\n   - Ensure you're using the latest version of Theano, as well as its dependencies like NumPy and SciPy. You can use `pip install --upgrade theano numpy scipy`.\n\n8. **Check Theano and CUDA Documentation:**\n   - Refer to the latest documentation for Theano and CUDA for any updates or specific instructions for Windows installations.\n\nIf the above steps do not resolve the issue, consider running your computations on a newer system or using a virtual machine that supports a more modern OS and software stack, as this might alleviate some of the compatibility issues inherent to Windows 8."
