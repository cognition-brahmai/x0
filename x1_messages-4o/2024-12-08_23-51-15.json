I have two arrays, one containing a list of adjectives and another containing a list of nouns, and I want to randomly select one adjective and one noun from each list and combine them to form the insult. Here are the lists of adjectives and nouns to use:\nAdjectives:\n- Insufferable\n- Obnoxious\n- Repulsive\n- Vile\n- Arrogant\n- Despicable\n- Ignorant\n- Pathetic\n- Sniveling\n- Terrible\nNouns:\n- Wretch\n- Fool\n- Scoundrel\n- Imbecile\n- Buffoon\n- Oaf\n- Creep\n- Jerk\n- Miscreant\n- Lout\nCan you provide me with Swift code to accomplish this task?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can use Swift's random number generation capabilities to select a random adjective and a random noun from your lists and combine them to generate a random insult. Here's a simple Swift function to achieve this:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nfunc generateRandomInsult() -> String {\n    let adjectives = [\n        \"Insufferable\",\n        \"Obnoxious\",\n        \"Repulsive\",\n        \"Vile\",\n        \"Arrogant\",\n        \"Despicable\",\n        \"Ignorant\",\n        \"Pathetic\",\n        \"Sniveling\",\n        \"Terrible\"\n    ]\n    \n    let nouns = [\n        \"Wretch\",\n        \"Fool\",\n        \"Scoundrel\",\n        \"Imbecile\",\n        \"Buffoon\",\n        \"Oaf\",\n        \"Creep\",\n        \"Jerk\",\n        \"Miscreant\",\n        \"Lout\"\n    ]\n    \n    let randomAdjective = adjectives.randomElement() ?? \"Despicable\"\n    let randomNoun = nouns.randomElement() ?? \"Fool\"\n    \n    return \"\\(randomAdjective) \\(randomNoun)\"\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nlet insult = generateRandomInsult()\nprint(insult)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Arrays of Adjectives and Nouns**: You have two arrays, one for adjectives and one for nouns.\n2. **Random Selection**: The `randomElement()` method is used to select a random element from each array. This method returns an optional, so we use the nil coalescing operator (`??`) to provide a default value in case the array is empty.\n3. **Combining**: The selected adjective and noun are combined into a single string that forms the insult.\n4. **Output**: The function returns the generated insult, which can be printed or used as needed.\n\nYou can call the `generateRandomInsult()` function whenever you need a new insult, and it will produce a random combination each time."
