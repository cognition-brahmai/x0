I'll provide a simple example using Flask to create the API and BeautifulSoup to scrape the website for news articles. Note that web scraping should be performed in accordance with the website's terms of service and robots.txt file.\n\nHere is a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Set Up Your Environment:**\n   - Ensure you have Python installed.\n   - Install necessary packages:\n     ```bash\n     pip install Flask requests beautifulsoup4\n     ```\n\n2. **Build the Flask API:**\n\n   Create a file named `app.py` and add the following code:\n\n   ```python\n   from flask import Flask, jsonify\n   import requests\n   from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n   app = Flask(__name__)\n\n   def get_latest_news():\n       url = 'https://example-news-website.com'  # Replace with the actual news website URL\n       response = requests.get(url)\n       if response.status_code != 200:\n           return []\n\n       soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\n       articles = []\n\n       # This part depends on the structure of the website. You need to inspect the website's HTML to find the correct selectors.\n       # For example, let's assume each article is within a <div> with class 'news-item'\n       for item in soup.find_all('div', class_='news-item')[:10]:\n           title = item.find('h2').text\n           link = item.find('a')['href']\n           articles.append({'title': title, 'link': link})\n\n       return articles\n\n   @app.route('/api/news', methods=['GET'])\n   def news():\n       latest_news = get_latest_news()\n       return jsonify(latest_news)\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       app.run(debug=True)\n   ```\n\n3. **Run Your API:**\n\n   Execute your Flask app using the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   python app.py\n   ```\n\n   By default, the Flask app will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.\n\n4. **Test Your API:**\n\n   Open your web browser or use a tool like Postman to visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/news`. You should see a JSON response containing the top 10 latest news articles.\n\n5. **Adjust Scraping Logic:**\n\n   The above code includes a generic example of how to scrape a website. You will need to adjust the BeautifulSoup parsing logic according to the structure of the website you are targeting. Use your browser's Developer Tools to inspect HTML elements and find appropriate tags and classes.\n\n6. **Handling Website Restrictions:**\n\n   - Always respect the `robots.txt` file of the website.\n   - Be mindful of any rate limits or scraping restrictions.\n   - Consider using an API provided by the news website if available, as it is often more reliable and faster than scraping.\n\nBy following these steps and tailoring the scraping logic to the specific website, you can build an HTTP API that provides the latest news articles."
