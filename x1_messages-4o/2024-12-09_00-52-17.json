        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'float',\" occurs because of a mistake in your loop where you're trying to multiply `growthRates` as a whole instead of its individual elements.\n\nIn Python, when you do `1 + 0.01 * growthRates`, you're trying to multiply the entire list `growthRates` by `0.01`, which is not allowed because `growthRates` is a list and not a single float or int value.\n\nHere's how you can correct the code:\n\nYou should iterate over the individual elements of `growthRates` and use them in your calculation. Here's the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef nestEgVariable(salary, save, growthRates):\n    SavingsRecord = []\n    fund = 0\n    depositPerYear = salary * save * 0.01\n    for rate in growthRates:  \n        fund = fund * (1 + 0.01 * rate) + depositPerYear\n        SavingsRecord.append(fund)\n    return SavingsRecord \n\nprint(nestEgVariable(10000, 10, [3, 4, 5, 0, 3]))\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n- Changed `growthRates` to `rate` in the loop to reference individual elements.\n- Used `append()` instead of `+=` to add elements to `SavingsRecord`.\n- Added parentheses in the `print` statement for Python 3 compatibility.\n\nThis should resolve the error and give you the expected result."
