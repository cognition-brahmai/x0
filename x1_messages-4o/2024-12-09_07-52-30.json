        "content": "In Python, you can execute system commands or call external programs using several different methods. Here are a few common approaches:\n\n1. **Using the `subprocess` module**: This is the recommended way to run external commands in Python.\n\n   ```python\n   import subprocess\n\n   # Run a simple command\n   result = subprocess.run(['ls', '-l'], capture_output=True, text=True)\n   print(\"Return code:\", result.returncode)\n   print(\"Output:\", result.stdout)\n   print(\"Error (if any):\", result.stderr)\n   ```\n\n   In this example, the `subprocess.run()` function executes the command and returns a `CompletedProcess` object. You can access the command's output and return code through this object.\n\n2. **Using `os.system()`**: This is a simpler method but not as flexible or safe as `subprocess`.\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n\n   # Execute a command\n   exit_code = os.system('ls -l')\n   print(\"Exit code:\", exit_code)\n   ```\n\n   Note that `os.system()` only returns the exit status of the command and does not capture the output.\n\n3. **Using `subprocess.Popen()`**: For more complex interactions with the command's input/output/error pipes, you can use `Popen`.\n\n   ```python\n   from subprocess import Popen, PIPE\n\n   process = Popen(['ls', '-l'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)\n   stdout, stderr = process.communicate()\n   print(\"Output:\", stdout.decode())\n   print(\"Error (if any):\", stderr.decode())\n   ```\n\n4. **Using `shlex.split()` with `subprocess.run()`**: If you want to safely execute a command that is a single string, you can use `shlex.split()` to split it into a list.\n\n   ```python\n   import shlex\n   import subprocess\n\n   command = \"ls -l\"\n   args = shlex.split(command)\n   result = subprocess.run(args, capture_output=True, text=True)\n   print(\"Output:\", result.stdout)\n   ```\n\nWhen executing system commands, always be cautious of shell injection vulnerabilities, especially if you're incorporating user input into the command. Using `subprocess.run()` with a list of arguments (rather than a single string) helps prevent such vulnerabilities."
