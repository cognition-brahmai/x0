However, when I try to insert it, the string is being sanitized for web-safe HTML. The code I'm using is `self.new_soup.body.insert(3, \"\"\"<div id=\"file_history\"></div>\"\"\")` and the result is `&lt;div id=\"file_histor\"y&gt;&lt;/div&gt;`, instead of the expected `<div id=\"file_history\"></div>`. How can I correctly insert this tag?"

        "content": "When you're working with BeautifulSoup, inserting a new tag requires creating a BeautifulSoup element for the tag you want to insert. Directly inserting a string will cause it to be treated as text, which is why you're seeing the HTML entities instead of the actual tag.\n\nTo correctly insert a new `div` tag with the ID `file_history` at position 3 in the body, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a new `Tag` object for your `div`.\n2. Insert this `Tag` object into the desired position.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup, Tag\n\n# Assuming self.new_soup is your BeautifulSoup object\nhtml_content = \"\"\"<html><body><div>First</div><div>Second</div><div>Third</div></body></html>\"\"\"\nself.new_soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')\n\n# Create a new Tag object for your div\nnew_div = Tag(name='div', attrs={'id': 'file_history'})\n\n# Insert the new tag at position 3 in the body\nself.new_soup.body.insert(3, new_div)\n\n# Print the modified HTML\nprint(self.new_soup.prettify())\n```\n\nIn this code, `Tag` is used to create a new element with the specified attributes. By using `self.new_soup.body.insert(3, new_div)`, you're correctly inserting the `Tag` object instead of a string, which prevents any HTML entity escaping issues."
