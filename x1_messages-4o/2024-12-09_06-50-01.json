I have mostly worked with chess variants, so I've typically used a basic chess evaluation function. However, I am now developing a program for a completely new board game and I am unsure of how to choose a suitable evaluation function. The game is played on a 10x10 board with six fixed pieces per side. Pieces have certain movement rules and interactions but none of them are ever captured. The aim of the game is to get enough of one's pieces into certain special squares on the board. The goal for the computer program is to compete with or surpass current human players. The same pieces are always on the board, so a usual material function won't change based on position, and the game hasn't been played enough times (less than a thousand) to gain sufficient human insights. I considered using a MoGo approach but it seems that random games are not likely to terminate. How can I develop a good or even decent evaluation function for this game?"

        "content": "Developing an evaluation function for a new board game, especially one with unique rules and objectives, can be challenging but also a rewarding task. Here are some steps and strategies you can consider to develop a suitable evaluation function for your game:\n\n1. **Understand the Game Dynamics**:\n   - Analyze the game's rules, objectives, and piece interactions thoroughly. Understand what makes a position strong or weak, and how different moves impact the game.\n\n2. **Define Key Metrics**:\n   - Since the goal is to get pieces into special squares, focus on metrics that evaluate how close each player is to achieving this objective.\n   - Consider proximity to special squares, control of important areas, and the potential to block the opponent's progress.\n\n3. **Positional Evaluation**:\n   - Develop heuristics for positional advantage. This could include factors like:\n     - Proximity to goal squares.\n     - Control over central or strategic areas of the board.\n     - Mobility and flexibility of pieces.\n     - Coordination among your pieces to achieve game objectives.\n\n4. **Progress Evaluation**:\n   - Create metrics that evaluate the progress towards game objectives, such as the number of pieces in or near special squares.\n   - Consider the potential for future moves to reach these squares.\n\n5. **Incorporate Game-Specific Strategies**:\n   - If there are tactics or strategies that emerge from the game's design, incorporate these into the evaluation function. For instance, setting up formations that maximize your pieces' influence.\n\n6. **Machine Learning Approaches**:\n   - Use machine learning to train an evaluation function based on game simulations. You can use reinforcement learning or supervised learning to learn from games played by different algorithms or human players.\n   - Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) could be adapted with heuristics to evaluate non-terminating positions better.\n\n7. **Iterative Improvement**:\n   - Start with a basic evaluation function and iteratively improve it by testing against human players and other algorithms.\n   - Analyze games where the AI performs poorly and identify weaknesses in the evaluation function.\n\n8. **Use Expert Feedback**:\n   - If possible, get feedback from human players who have some experience with the game. Their insights can help you refine your evaluation criteria.\n\n9. **Hybrid Approaches**:\n   - Consider combining different evaluation strategies, such as a mix of rule-based and learning-based approaches to capture both strategic depth and adaptability.\n\n10. **Testing and Tuning**:\n    - Continuously test the evaluation function and tune parameters based on performance in various game situations.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, you'll be able to develop a more tailored evaluation function that aligns with the unique objectives and challenges of your board game."
