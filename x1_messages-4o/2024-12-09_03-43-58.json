For instance, if I have the directory name as '/home/me/dev/my_reports', base filename as 'daily_report', and format as 'pdf', I need to create a string '/home/me/dev/my_reports/daily_report.pdf'. I tried using os.path.join but it resulted in '/home/me/dev/my_reports/daily_report/pdf'. Note that the directory may or may not exist at the time of call."

        "content": "To construct a file path from a directory name, base filename, and a file format string in Python, you can use the `os.path.join` function to combine the directory and the file name, and then manually append the file extension. The `os.path.join` function is typically used to ensure that the directory and the file name are properly concatenated with the appropriate path separators.\n\nHere's a way to achieve your goal:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndirectory = '/home/me/dev/my_reports'\nbase_filename = 'daily_report'\nfile_format = 'pdf'\n\n# Construct the full file path\nfile_path = os.path.join(directory, f\"{base_filename}.{file_format}\")\n\nprint(file_path)\n```\n\nThis code snippet will correctly produce the desired path string: `/home/me/dev/my_reports/daily_report.pdf`.\n\nKey points:\n- Use `os.path.join` to combine the directory and the base filename, ensuring the correct path separator is used.\n- Use an f-string or string concatenation to append the file extension to the base filename.\n\nThis approach ensures that the path is constructed correctly regardless of the operating system or whether the directory exists at the time of the call."
