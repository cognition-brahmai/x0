        "content": "Certainly! Here's a simple solution in Python to generate random numbers between 1 and 10, store them in an array, and then sort the array in ascending order:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# Generate 10 random numbers between 1 and 10\nrandom_numbers = [random.randint(1, 10) for _ in range(10)]\n\nprint(\"Unsorted Array:\", random_numbers)\n\n# Sort the array in ascending order\nrandom_numbers.sort()\n\nprint(\"Sorted Array:\", random_numbers)\n```\n\nHere's a quick breakdown of the code:\n\n1. We import the `random` module, which provides the `randint` function to generate random numbers.\n2. We use a list comprehension to generate a list of 10 random numbers between 1 and 10.\n3. We print the unsorted array.\n4. We use the `sort()` method to sort the array in ascending order.\n5. Finally, we print the sorted array.\n\nYou can adjust the number of random numbers or the range as needed!"
