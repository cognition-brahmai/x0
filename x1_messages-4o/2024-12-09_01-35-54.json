I have a basic understanding of 'requests' and 'cgminer' but I am struggling with being more specific. Here's the code I'm trying to simplify using 'requests':\n\n```python\nimport socket\nimport json\n\nsock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\nsock.connect(('localhost', 4028))\n\nsock.send(json.dumps({'command': 'summary'}))\n```\n\nI want to send the JSON request and then store the response in a variable."

        "content": "To use the `requests` library to send a JSON request to `cgminer's API`, you can use the `requests.post` method, specifying the appropriate port. Since `cgminer` typically uses a simple TCP socket for its API, you will need to use a slightly different approach because the `requests` library is designed for HTTP requests, not raw sockets. However, you can still achieve this using the `socket` library while simplifying your code.\n\nHere is a revised version of your code using the `socket` library that handles JSON requests and responses:\n\n```python\nimport socket\nimport json\n\ndef send_cgminer_command(command, host='localhost', port=4028):\n    # Create a socket connection\n    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as sock:\n        # Connect to the cgminer API\n        sock.connect((host, port))\n        \n        # Send the command to the API\n        request = json.dumps({'command': command})\n        sock.sendall(request.encode('utf-8'))\n        \n        # Receive the response from the API\n        response = ''\n        while True:\n            data = sock.recv(4096)\n            if not data:\n                break\n            response += data.decode('utf-8')\n        \n    # Parse the JSON response\n    response_data = json.loads(response)\n    return response_data\n\n# Example usage\nresponse = send_cgminer_command('summary')\nprint(response)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We define a function `send_cgminer_command` that takes a command and optionally the host and port as arguments.\n- We create a socket connection to the specified host and port.\n- We send the JSON-encoded command using `sock.sendall`.\n- We then receive the response in chunks, appending each chunk to the `response` string until no more data is received.\n- Finally, we parse the JSON response and return it.\n\nThis approach is more concise and maintains the use of sockets, which is necessary for communicating with `cgminer's` API, as it does not use HTTP."
