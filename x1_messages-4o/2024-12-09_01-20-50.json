Is there a built-in function that can calculate the absolute difference between two numbers without me explicitly determining which number is larger? For example, I want both `distance(6,3)` and `distance(3,6)` to return 3. Currently, I have written a custom function to calculate this difference, but I am looking for a built-in Python function or module that performs this operation faster.\n\nHere is my custom function:\n\n```python\ndef distance(x, y):\n    if x >= y:\n        result = x - y\n    else:\n        result = y - x\n    return result\n```"

        "content": "Yes, Python provides a built-in function called `abs()` that can help you calculate the absolute difference between two numbers without having to determine which one is larger. You can simply use this function to achieve the same functionality as your custom `distance` function. Here's how you can use `abs()` in your case:\n\n```python\ndef distance(x, y):\n    return abs(x - y)\n```\n\nThis single line will return the absolute difference between `x` and `y`, regardless of which one is larger, just like you wanted. The `abs()` function is efficient and widely used for such tasks. You can use it directly in your code wherever you need to calculate the absolute difference between two numbers."
