Now, whenever I try to open any page in my site, I encounter a ProgrammingError: \"relation \"django_session\" does not exist\". This error occurs whenever I attempt to access the URL http://127.0.0.1:8000/login/. I am using Django Version 1.7 and Python 2.7 in a virtual environment. My database settings in settings.py are as follows:\n\n```\nDATABASES = {\n    'default': {\n        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',\n        'NAME': 'myDB',\n        'USER': 'alex',\n        'PASSWORD': 'mypassword',\n        'HOST': '127.0.0.1',\n        'PORT': '5432',\n    }\n}\n```\nCan anyone please guide me on how to fix this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"relation 'django_session' does not exist,\" indicates that the necessary database tables haven't been created yet. This usually happens when the database migrations haven't been run. Django uses migrations to create and update database schema, and it appears that you may have missed running them after setting up your database or making changes.\n\nHere's what you need to do to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure the Database is Set Up Correctly:**\n   - Make sure that your PostgreSQL server is running and accessible.\n   - Confirm that the database `myDB` exists. You can create the database using a PostgreSQL client or command-line tool if it doesn't exist.\n\n2. **Run Migrations:**\n   - Activate your virtual environment if it's not already activated.\n   - Navigate to the root directory of your Django project where `manage.py` is located.\n   - Run the following command to apply migrations:\n     ```bash\n     python manage.py migrate\n     ```\n   This command will apply all pending migrations, which should create the necessary tables, including `django_session`.\n\n3. **Check for Migration Files:**\n   - Ensure that you have migration files for your apps. These files are usually located in the `migrations` directory inside each app. If they are missing, you might need to create them by running:\n     ```bash\n     python manage.py makemigrations\n     ```\n\n4. **Verify INSTALLED_APPS Settings:**\n   - Make sure that `'django.contrib.sessions'` is included in your `INSTALLED_APPS` list in `settings.py`. This is necessary for managing user sessions.\n\n5. **Check for Errors:**\n   - If you encounter any errors while running migrations, carefully read the error messages as they can provide clues for what might be wrong.\n\n6. **Database User Permissions:**\n   - Ensure that the database user (`alex` in your case) has the necessary permissions to create tables and manage the database schema.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the \"relation 'django_session' does not exist\" error and get your Django application running smoothly again."
