The solution should also work when the iterables are generators, as the length of generators is not defined and results in a `TypeError: object of type 'generator' has no len()`. Is there a simpler implementation of the function `zip_equal`?\n\nHere is the code I am currently using:\n```python\ndef zip_equal(it1, it2):\n    exhausted = False\n    while True:\n        try:\n            el1 = next(it1)\n            if exhausted:\n                raise ValueError(\"it1 and it2 have different lengths\")\n        except StopIteration:\n            exhausted = True\n        try:\n            el2 = next(it2)\n            if exhausted:\n                raise ValueError(\"it1 and it2 have different lengths\")\n        except StopIteration:\n            if not exhausted:\n                raise ValueError(\"it1 and it2 have different lengths\")\n            exhausted = True\n        if not exhausted:\n            yield (el1, el2)\n        else:\n            return\n```\nI have tested this solution with the following code:\n```python\nit1 = (x for x in ['a', 'b', 'c'])\nit2 = (x for x in [0, 1, 2, 3])\nlist(zip_equal(it1, it2)) \nit1 = (x for x in ['a', 'b', 'c'])\nit2 = (x for x in [0, 1, 2, 3])\nlist(zip_equal(it2, it1)) \nit1 = (x for x in ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])\nit2 = (x for x in [0, 1, 2, 3])\nlist(zip_equal(it1, it2)) \n```"

        "content": "To simplify your `zip_equal` function while ensuring it raises an exception if the iterables have different lengths, you can use `itertools.zip_longest` from the `itertools` module. By specifying a unique fill value, you can detect when one iterable is exhausted before the other. Below is a simplified implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import zip_longest\n\ndef zip_equal(*iterables):\n    # Using a unique object as a fill value\n    sentinel = object()\n    \n    for elements in zip_longest(*iterables, fillvalue=sentinel):\n        # Check if any element is the sentinel, indicating differing lengths\n        if any(el is sentinel for el in elements):\n            raise ValueError(\"Iterables have different lengths\")\n        yield elements\n\n# Example usage\ntry:\n    it1 = (x for x in ['a', 'b', 'c'])\n    it2 = (x for x in [0, 1, 2, 3])\n    print(list(zip_equal(it1, it2)))\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(e)\n\ntry:\n    it1 = (x for x in ['a', 'b', 'c'])\n    it2 = (x for x in [0, 1, 2, 3])\n    print(list(zip_equal(it2, it1)))\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(e)\n\ntry:\n    it1 = (x for x in ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])\n    it2 = (x for x in [0, 1, 2, 3])\n    print(list(zip_equal(it1, it2)))\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(e)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Sentinel:** A unique object is used as a fill value (`sentinel`). This helps in identifying when one iterable is exhausted.\n- **`zip_longest`:** This function will continue until the longest iterable is exhausted, filling shorter iterables with the sentinel.\n- **Exception Handling:** If any element in the zipped result is the sentinel, it indicates differing lengths, and a `ValueError` is raised.\n- **Generality:** This approach works with any number of iterables, including generators, and maintains the desired behavior of raising an exception when lengths differ.\n\nThis version is concise and leverages Python's standard library to handle the problem efficiently."
