However, when I attempt to use the same concept with lambda functions, I encounter a SyntaxError. Here is a snippet of the code that I tried:\n\n```python\ndef simpledecorator(f):\n     def new_f():\n         print \"Using a decorator: \"\n         f()\n     return  new_f\n\n@simpledecorator\ndef hello():\n    print \"Hello world!\"\n```\nThis produces the correct output \"Using a simple decorator: Hello world!\". Although, when I try with a lambda function:\n\n```python\n@simpledecorator\nf = lambda x: x * 2\n```\nI get a SyntaxError:\n\n```python\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 2\n    f = lambda x: x * 2\n    ^\n SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n```\nI am interested in understanding if there exists a syntax to apply decorators to lambda functions."

        "content": "Decorators in Python are typically used with function definitions, as seen in your example with the `hello` function. However, when it comes to lambda functions, the syntax for using decorators directly with the `@decorator` syntax is not supported. This is because the `@decorator` syntax is syntactic sugar specifically for function definitions, and lambda functions are expressions rather than statements.\n\nHowever, you can still apply decorators to lambda functions, just not with the `@decorator` syntax. Instead, you have to manually apply the decorator by passing the lambda function as an argument to the decorator function. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef simpledecorator(f):\n    def new_f(*args, **kwargs):\n        print(\"Using a decorator:\")\n        return f(*args, **kwargs)\n    return new_f\n\n# Manually applying the decorator to the lambda function\nf = simpledecorator(lambda x: x * 2)\n\n# Now you can use the decorated lambda function\nresult = f(5)\nprint(result)  # Output: Using a decorator: 10\n```\n\nIn this example, `simpledecorator` is applied to the lambda function by calling `simpledecorator(lambda x: x * 2)`. The decorator function returns a new function that wraps the lambda, adding the desired behavior. This way, you can decorate a lambda function without using the `@` syntax."
