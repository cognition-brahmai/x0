Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nlist_1 = [['good', 100, 20, 0.2], ['bad', 10, 0, 0.0], ['change', 1, 2, 2]]\n\n# Apply the condition to filter the list\nfiltered_list = [item for item in list_1 if not (item[3] > 0.3 and item[2] < 5)]\n\nprint(filtered_list)\n```\n\nIn this code, `filtered_list` will contain only the elements of `list_1` that do not have a `change_status` greater than 0.3 and a `bad_freq` less than 5. The condition inside the list comprehension checks if an item should be removed, and the `not` operator is used to keep only the items that do not satisfy the condition."
