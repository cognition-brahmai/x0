Instead of using a comma, you should use the `as` keyword. Here's how you can correctly catch a `ValueError` and print out the error message:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Some code that may raise a ValueError\n    value = int(\"not a number\")\nexcept ValueError as err:\n    print(f\"An error occurred: {err}\")\n```\n\nIn this code, `err` is the variable that stores the exception object, and you can use it to access the error message associated with the `ValueError`. The `f-string` (formatted string literal) is used here for convenient and readable string formatting."
