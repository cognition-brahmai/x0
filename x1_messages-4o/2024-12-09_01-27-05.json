However, I am facing an issue with the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\ndef parse_html(filename):\n    \"\"\"Extract the Author, Title and Text from a HTML file\n    which was produced by pdftotext with the option -htmlmeta.\"\"\"\n    with open(filename) as infile:\n        html = BeautifulSoup(infile, \"html.parser\", from_encoding='utf-8')\n        d = {'text': html.pre.text}\n        if html.title is not None:\n            d['title'] = html.title.text\n        for meta in html.findAll('meta'):\n            try:\n                if meta['name'] in ('Author', 'Title'):\n                    d[meta['name'].lower()] = meta['content']\n            except KeyError:\n                continue\n        return d\n\nparse_html(\"C:\\\\pdf\\\\pydf\\\\data\\\\muellner2011.html\")\n```\n\nWhen I run this code, I get the following error:\n\n```\nUnicodeDecodeError: 'charmap' codec can't decode byte 0x9d in position 867: character maps to <undefined>enter code here\n```\n\nI came across some solutions online suggesting the use of encode() function to fix this issue. However, I am not sure how to incorporate the encode() function in my code. Can someone guide me on this?"

        "content": "The `UnicodeDecodeError` you're encountering is likely due to the default encoding used when opening the file, which doesn't match the encoding of your HTML file. To address this issue, you can explicitly specify the encoding when opening the file. Since you're using `utf-8` as the `from_encoding` in `BeautifulSoup`, it's a good idea to use the same encoding when opening the file.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to fix the issue:\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\ndef parse_html(filename):\n    \"\"\"Extract the Author, Title and Text from a HTML file\n    which was produced by pdftotext with the option -htmlmeta.\"\"\"\n    # Open the file with the correct encoding\n    with open(filename, encoding='utf-8') as infile:\n        # Parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup\n        html = BeautifulSoup(infile, \"html.parser\")\n        d = {'text': html.pre.text if html.pre else ''}\n        if html.title is not None:\n            d['title'] = html.title.text\n        for meta in html.findAll('meta'):\n            try:\n                if meta.get('name') in ('Author', 'Title'):\n                    d[meta['name'].lower()] = meta['content']\n            except KeyError:\n                continue\n        return d\n\n# Call the function with your file path\nparse_html(\"C:\\\\pdf\\\\pydf\\\\data\\\\muellner2011.html\")\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n\n1. **File Encoding:** Use `encoding='utf-8'` in the `open` function to ensure the file is read with the correct encoding.\n\n2. **Check for HTML Tags:** Added a condition to check if `html.pre` exists before accessing its `text` attribute to avoid potential `NoneType` errors.\n\n3. **Meta Tag Check:** Used `meta.get('name')` to safely access the `name` attribute, preventing `KeyError` if the `name` attribute is missing.\n\nThese changes should help eliminate the `UnicodeDecodeError` and make your HTML parsing more robust."
