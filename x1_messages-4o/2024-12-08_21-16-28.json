If I want to calculate the perimeter of this polygon, I can use the formula P = na, where n is the number of sides of the polygon. Now, if I tell you that the perimeter of this polygon is 6a, can you tell me how many sides does this polygon have? Also, can you tell me the name of this polygon?"

If the perimeter of the equilateral polygon is given by \\( P = 6a \\), and the formula for the perimeter is \\( P = na \\), we can equate these two expressions:\n\n\\[ na = 6a \\]\n\nBy dividing both sides of the equation by \\( a \\) (assuming \\( a \\neq 0 \\)), we get:\n\n\\[ n = 6 \\]\n\nSo, the polygon has 6 sides. A polygon with 6 sides is called a hexagon."
