However, I am unable to set 'curYear' as a string initially, as I need to decrement it in a loop. How can I convert an integer to a string in Jinja?"

        "content": "In Jinja, you can easily convert an integer to a string using the `|string` filter. This allows you to perform comparisons between a string and an integer by converting the integer to a string first. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```jinja\n{% set curYear = 2013 %}\n{% set yearString = \"2013\" %}\n\n{% if curYear|string == yearString %}\n  The integer and the string are equal.\n{% else %}\n  The integer and the string are not equal.\n{% endif %}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `|string` filter converts the integer `curYear` to a string, enabling the comparison with the string `yearString`. This approach allows you to handle the comparison while still being able to decrement the integer `curYear` in your loop as needed."
