        "content": "Certainly! Below is a table comparing the characteristics of tropical rainforests located near the equator and those not located near the equator:\n\n| Characteristic     | Near the Equator                          | Not Near the Equator                          |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Temperature        | Consistently warm (25-30\u00b0C)               | Warm, but may have more variation (20-28\u00b0C)   |\n| Precipitation      | Very high (2000-4000 mm/year)             | High, but can be slightly less (1500-3000 mm/year) |\n| Humidity           | Very high (80-100%)                       | Generally high, but can be slightly lower (70-90%) |\n| Soil Type          | Often nutrient-poor, acidic, thin         | Similar, but may vary slightly with location  |\n\nBased on the table, let's evaluate the statements:\n\n1. **Tropical rainforests are always located near the equator.**  \n   - This statement is **false**. While many tropical rainforests are located near the equator, there are tropical rainforests outside of the equatorial belt, such as those in Southeast Asia and parts of Central America.\n\n2. **Tropical rainforests always have high humidity.**  \n   - This statement is **true**. Tropical rainforests, regardless of their location, are characterized by high humidity levels due to their dense vegetation and significant rainfall.\n\nTherefore, the false statement is: **Tropical rainforests are always located near the equator.**"
