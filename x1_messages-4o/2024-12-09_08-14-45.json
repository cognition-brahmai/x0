I've created a simple DB abstraction class and I'm attempting to run a full VACUUM after a daily operation that inserts several thousand rows. However, when I try to run the VACUUM command within my code, I encounter the error `psycopg2.InternalError: VACUUM cannot run inside a transaction block`. Here is a subset of my code for reference:\n\n```python\nclass db(object):\n    def __init__(dbname, host, port, user, password):\n        self.conn = psycopg2.connect(\"dbname=%s host=%s port=%s \\\n                                      user=%s password=%s\" \\\n                                      % (dbname, host, port, user, password))\n\n        self.cursor = self.conn.cursor()\n\n    def _doQuery(self, query):\n        self.cursor.execute(query)\n        self.conn.commit()\n\n    def vacuum(self):\n        query = \"VACUUM FULL\"\n        self._doQuery(query)\n```\nHow can I successfully execute the VACUUM command from my code?"

        "content": "To run a `VACUUM` command using `psycopg2` in Python without encountering the `VACUUM cannot run inside a transaction block` error, you need to execute the command outside of a transaction block. By default, psycopg2 automatically starts a transaction when you execute a command, so you need to use a different approach to run `VACUUM`.\n\nOne way to execute `VACUUM` without starting a transaction is by using `autocommit` mode. In `autocommit` mode, each statement is executed and committed immediately, which is suitable for commands like `VACUUM` that cannot be run inside a transaction block.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use `autocommit` mode for the `VACUUM` command:\n\n```python\nimport psycopg2\n\nclass db(object):\n    def __init__(self, dbname, host, port, user, password):\n        self.conn = psycopg2.connect(\"dbname=%s host=%s port=%s \\\n                                      user=%s password=%s\" \\\n                                      % (dbname, host, port, user, password))\n        self.conn.autocommit = True  # Enable autocommit mode\n        self.cursor = self.conn.cursor()\n\n    def _doQuery(self, query):\n        self.cursor.execute(query)\n        # Do not call self.conn.commit() here, as autocommit is enabled\n\n    def vacuum(self):\n        query = \"VACUUM FULL\"\n        self._doQuery(query)\n\n# Example usage:\n# db_instance = db('your_dbname', 'your_host', 'your_port', 'your_user', 'your_password')\n# db_instance.vacuum()\n```\n\nIn this updated code, `self.conn.autocommit = True` is set in the constructor to enable autocommit mode, which means that each statement executed is immediately committed. This allows you to run `VACUUM` without being inside a transaction block. Note that you should not call `conn.commit()` when autocommit is enabled, as each command is automatically committed."
