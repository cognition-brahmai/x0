        "content": "Certainly! You can create a Java class to store and calculate the distance between two points. Here's a simple implementation for that:\n\n```java\npublic class PointDistance {\n    // Instance variables to store the coordinates\n    private double x1, y1, x2, y2;\n\n    // Constructor to initialize the coordinates\n    public PointDistance(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2) {\n        this.x1 = x1;\n        this.y1 = y1;\n        this.x2 = x2;\n        this.y2 = y2;\n    }\n\n    // Method to calculate the distance between the two points\n    public double calculateDistance() {\n        // Using the distance formula: sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)\n        return Math.sqrt(Math.pow((x2 - x1), 2) + Math.pow((y2 - y1), 2));\n    }\n\n    // Getter methods for the coordinates\n    public double getX1() {\n        return x1;\n    }\n\n    public double getY1() {\n        return y1;\n    }\n\n    public double getX2() {\n        return x2;\n    }\n\n    public double getY2() {\n        return y2;\n    }\n\n    // Main method to test the class\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Create an instance of PointDistance\n        PointDistance distance = new PointDistance(3, 4, 7, 1);\n\n        // Calculate and display the distance\n        System.out.println(\"The distance between the points is: \" + distance.calculateDistance());\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Attributes**: The class `PointDistance` has four attributes to store the coordinates of the two points.\n- **Constructor**: It initializes the coordinates when an instance of the class is created.\n- **Method `calculateDistance`**: This method calculates the distance between the two points using the distance formula: \\(\\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\\).\n- **Main Method**: The `main` method demonstrates creating an instance of the `PointDistance` class and using it to calculate and print the distance.\n\nYou can modify the `main` method or create instances with different coordinates to calculate the distance between different points."
