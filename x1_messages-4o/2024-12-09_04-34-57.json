        "content": "I am using PyCharm as an editor for Python code in Houdini and I'm encountering an issue with importing the main Houdini library (hou). Although my code executes without any problems both in Houdini and my selected interpreter, PyCharm flags 'import hou' as an error. This results in subsequent files that import this file also being flagged as errors. Therefore, I lose type ahead functionality and get an abundance of error messages, making it hard to spot the real problems. The piece of code I'm using is:\n\n```python\ntry:  \n   import hou  \nexcept ImportError:  \n    # Add $HFS/houdini/python2.6libs to sys.path so Python can find the  \n    # hou module.  \n    sys.path.append(os.environ['HFS'] + \"/houdini/python%d.%dlibs\" % sys.version_info[:2])  \n    import hou \n```\n\nHow can I get PyCharm to recognize the path to the hou module? I've tried looking for a solution online but they all seem to refer to tabs and settings that are not in my version of PyCharm (Community Edition 3.4.1). For example, my 'Project Interpreter' setting only has a list of Packages and does not have a 'path' tab as stated in many 'fixes' to closely related problems."

        "content": "To resolve the issue with PyCharm not recognizing the `hou` module, you can follow these steps to configure the interpreter and project structure properly. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Check Houdini's Python Version**:\n   - First, ensure that the Python version used by Houdini matches the Python interpreter version you are using in PyCharm. Houdini might be using Python 2.x or 3.x, so make sure your PyCharm interpreter matches this.\n\n2. **Add Houdini's Python Path**:\n   - You need to add Houdini's Python library path to your PyCharm project. This can be done by setting up environment variables or modifying the project's interpreter paths.\n\n3. **Configure Environment Variables**:\n   - Go to `Run` > `Edit Configurations` in PyCharm.\n   - Select your configuration and look for `Environment variables`.\n   - Add a new environment variable with the name `PYTHONPATH` and set its value to the path of Houdini's Python library, which is `$HFS/houdini/python2.xlibs` or `$HFS/houdini/python3.xlibs` depending on the version you are using.\n\n4. **Modify Python Interpreter Paths**:\n   - Go to `File` > `Settings` (or `PyCharm` > `Preferences` on macOS).\n   - Navigate to `Project: <Your Project Name>` > `Python Interpreter`.\n   - Click on the gear icon and select `Show All`.\n   - Choose your interpreter and click on the `Show paths` button.\n   - Add the Houdini library path (`$HFS/houdini/python2.xlibs` or `$HFS/houdini/python3.xlibs`) to the list of interpreter paths.\n\n5. **Recheck the Import**:\n   - After setting the environment variables or modifying the interpreter paths, PyCharm should be able to recognize the `hou` module, and the error flags should be resolved.\n\n6. **Use a Virtual Environment**:\n   - Consider creating a virtual environment that mirrors the Houdini Python environment. You can then activate this virtual environment within PyCharm. This can help isolate dependencies and make sure everything is set up correctly.\n\n7. **PyCharm's Caches and Indexing**:\n   - Sometimes, PyCharm needs to refresh its caches. Go to `File` > `Invalidate Caches / Restart` and select `Invalidate and Restart`.\n\nIf the above steps don't resolve the issue, consider upgrading to a newer version of PyCharm, as newer versions might provide better support and options for managing Python paths and environments. Additionally, you may want to consult Houdini's documentation or forums for any specific integration tips with PyCharm."
