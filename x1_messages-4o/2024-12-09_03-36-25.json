        "content": "I am attempting to order an array of 3D coordinates along a path. I've been using an adapted Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solution with the LKH solver (Helsgaun 2009). I've added a point at or near the origin and a point at a distance of zero from every point. This works fine except when the path crosses itself. TSP solutions cannot have closed loops, so I always get an open loop. How can I remedy this problem? Can I help the solver preserve the direction of the path whenever possible? I've considered using another metric instead of L2 and evaluating the local colinearity of every set of three points. Would either of these ideas work?"

        "content": "When dealing with the problem of ordering 3D coordinates along a path where the path may cross itself, you're right that the standard TSP solutions will not inherently handle closed loops or self-intersections, as TSP traditionally seeks a single loop that visits each point exactly once.\n\nHere are some strategies you might consider to address this issue:\n\n1. **Modify the Problem Representation**: Instead of adding a point at a distance of zero from every point, you could modify the problem representation to include additional constraints or modifications that allow for revisiting points or crossing paths. This would make the problem more akin to a multi-tour TSP or a pathfinding problem with potential revisits.\n\n2. **Use a Different Metric**: Switching from the L2 (Euclidean) metric to a different metric might help, especially if you can find a metric that inherently discourages self-intersections. However, this could also complicate the problem if the new metric does not align well with the natural geometry of your data.\n\n3. **Colinearity Checks**: Evaluating the local colinearity of every set of three points is a promising idea. You could implement a heuristic that penalizes or discourages directions that disrupt local linearity. This could be done as a post-processing step where you adjust the order of points to improve colinearity, or as a modification to the cost function used by the solver.\n\n4. **Custom Heuristics or Post-Processing**: Implement custom heuristics that encourage or maintain a certain directionality or path shape. This can be done by post-processing the solution given by the TSP solver to adjust for preferred path characteristics, such as minimizing sharp turns or maintaining continuity.\n\n5. **Graph-Based Approaches**: Consider using graph-based approaches that allow for more complex path topologies, including self-intersections. Algorithms like Dijkstra's or A* (with modifications) can help find paths that are optimal in terms of certain criteria, such as minimizing path length while allowing for revisits.\n\n6. **Path Optimization Algorithms**: Look into path optimization algorithms that are designed to handle loops and revisits, such as those used in robotics for path planning. Algorithms like RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree) or PRM (Probabilistic Roadmap) might be adapted to your needs.\n\nUltimately, the best approach may depend on the specific characteristics of your data and the requirements of your application. It may be worthwhile to experiment with a combination of these methods to find a solution that best preserves the desired path characteristics while handling self-intersections effectively."
