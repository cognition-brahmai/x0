When I search for scikit-learn using `pip search scikit-learn`, it shows me that scikit-learn version 0.12.1 is installed. However, when I try to import sklearn into Python, I get an `ImportError: No module named sklearn`. I am using Enthought's free distribution of Python (2.7.3) on a Mac OS 10.6.8 with NumPy 1.6.1 and SciPy 0.10.1. I was expecting the pip installation to upgrade my version of scikit-learn, allowing me to use it. How can I resolve this import error?"

        "content": "To resolve the `ImportError: No module named sklearn`, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. **Verify the Installation**: First, ensure that scikit-learn is installed in the correct Python environment. You can do this by checking the list of installed packages:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip list\n   ```\n\n   This should show `scikit-learn` along with its version. If not, it might have been installed in a different environment.\n\n2. **Check Python Environment**: Make sure that the Python you are using to run your script is the same one where you installed scikit-learn. You can check the Python path by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   which python\n   ```\n\n   Compare this path with the Python path used by pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   which pip\n   ```\n\n   If they are different, you may need to activate the correct environment or use the full path to the correct Python interpreter.\n\n3. **Use Virtual Environment**: It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage your dependencies. You can create and activate a virtual environment using:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux\n   myenv\\Scripts\\activate  # On Windows\n   ```\n\n   Then, reinstall scikit-learn in this environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install -U scikit-learn\n   ```\n\n4. **Check PYTHONPATH**: Ensure that your `PYTHONPATH` is correctly set up and that it includes the directory where scikit-learn is installed. You can check this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   echo $PYTHONPATH\n   ```\n\n   Adjust it if necessary to include the path to your site-packages directory.\n\n5. **Reinstall scikit-learn**: If the above steps don't work, try uninstalling and then reinstalling scikit-learn:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall scikit-learn\n   pip install scikit-learn\n   ```\n\n6. **Compatibility and System Update**: Since you are using an older version of macOS and Python, consider updating your Python to a more recent version if possible. Newer versions of Python and packages may have resolved compatibility issues.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the import error and successfully use scikit-learn in your Python environment."
