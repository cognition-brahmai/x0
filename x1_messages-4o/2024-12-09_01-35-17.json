        "content": "To generate a series of text files with names like \"fileX.txt\" where X is an integer, you need to ensure that you are converting the integer to a string before concatenating it with other strings. This can be done using Python's string formatting methods. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(10):  # Adjust the range as needed\n    filename = \"ME\" + str(i) + \".txt\"  # Convert the integer to a string\n    with open(filename, 'w') as file:\n        file.write(\"This is file number: \" + str(i))  # Example content\n    print(f\"Created file: {filename}\")\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use f-strings (available in Python 3.6 and above) for a more readable approach:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(10):  # Adjust the range as needed\n    filename = f\"ME{i}.txt\"  # Use f-string for formatting\n    with open(filename, 'w') as file:\n        file.write(f\"This is file number: {i}\")  # Example content\n    print(f\"Created file: {filename}\")\n```\n\nIn both examples, the integer `i` is converted to a string before being concatenated with the other parts of the filename. This will prevent the type error you encountered. Adjust the range in `range(10)` to generate as many files as you need."
