        "content": "To write a unit test in Python that only fails if a certain function doesn't throw an expected exception, you can use the `unittest` framework, which is part of Python's standard library. The `unittest` module provides a method called `assertRaises`, which is specifically designed for this purpose.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:\n\n1. **Import the `unittest` module**: You need to import the `unittest` module to define and run your tests.\n\n2. **Define a test case class**: Create a subclass of `unittest.TestCase`. This class will contain your test methods.\n\n3. **Write a test method**: Inside your test case class, define a method that tests the function in question. Use the `assertRaises` method to specify the exception that you expect the function to throw.\n\n4. **Run the test**: Use `unittest.main()` to run the test if this script is being executed as the main program.\n\nHere's an example to illustrate these steps:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\n\n# Suppose this is the function you want to test\ndef function_that_raises(value):\n    if value < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Negative value not allowed\")\n    return value\n\n# Define the test case class\nclass TestFunction(unittest.TestCase):\n\n    # Define the test method\n    def test_function_raises_value_error(self):\n        # Use assertRaises to check for the expected exception\n        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):\n            function_that_raises(-1)\n\n# Run the tests\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`assertRaises`**: This method is used in conjunction with a `with` statement. It checks that the function call within the block raises the specified exception. If the exception is raised, the test passes. If the function does not raise the exception, the test fails.\n\n- **`unittest.main()`**: This function runs all the test methods in the script when executed. It's typically placed under the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block to ensure that tests are run only when the script is executed directly, not when it's imported as a module.\n\nThis setup will only fail the test if the `function_that_raises` does not raise a `ValueError` when called with a negative value, as expected."
