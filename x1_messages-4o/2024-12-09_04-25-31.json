I'm using the new environment variable support in AWS Lambda and I've added an environment variable via the web UI for my function. However, when I tried to access it using the os module in Python, like this:\n\n```python\nimport os\nMY_ENV_VAR = os.environ['MY_ENV_VAR']\n```\nmy function ceased to work. Everything functions properly when I hard code the relevant value for `MY_ENV_VAR`. How can I solve this issue?"

        "content": "Accessing environment variables in an AWS Lambda function using Python is typically done using the `os.environ` dictionary, just as you've shown. If your function isn't working when you attempt to access an environment variable, here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Environment Variable Name:**\n   Ensure that the environment variable name is spelled correctly and matches exactly what you've set in the AWS Lambda console. Environment variable names are case-sensitive.\n\n2. **Ensure Environment Variable is Set:**\n   Double-check the AWS Lambda console to confirm that the environment variable is indeed set for the version of the function you're trying to run. Sometimes, changes might not be saved properly, or you might be working with a different version or alias of the function.\n\n3. **Error Handling:**\n   Add error handling to manage cases where the environment variable might not be set. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   try:\n       MY_ENV_VAR = os.environ['MY_ENV_VAR']\n   except KeyError:\n       raise Exception(\"Environment variable 'MY_ENV_VAR' not found\")\n   ```\n\n   This will provide a more informative error message if the environment variable is missing.\n\n4. **Logging:**\n   Add logging to your Lambda function to help diagnose the issue. For example, you can print out the list of environment variables to see if `MY_ENV_VAR` is present:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   import logging\n\n   logger = logging.getLogger()\n   logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)\n\n   def lambda_handler(event, context):\n       logger.info(\"Environment Variables: %s\", os.environ)\n       # Your function logic here\n   ```\n\n5. **Permissions:**\n   If you're using AWS KMS to encrypt environment variables, ensure that your Lambda function's execution role has the necessary permissions (`kms:Decrypt`) for the KMS key.\n\n6. **Deployment:**\n   Make sure that the most recent changes are deployed. Sometimes, changes in the AWS Console might not propagate immediately if there is a lag or if there are multiple versions of the function in use.\n\n7. **Testing Locally:**\n   If you are testing locally, ensure that you have set the environment variables in your local testing environment as well. You can use tools like AWS SAM or Docker to simulate the Lambda environment.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the issue with accessing environment variables in your Lambda function."
