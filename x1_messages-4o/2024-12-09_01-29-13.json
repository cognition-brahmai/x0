I've been reading the Python documentation and I'm having difficulty understanding their distinction. Could someone provide me with code examples where these two functions differentiate? For instance, I've noticed that they behave similarly in the following cases:\n\n```python\n>>> str.isdecimal('1')\nTrue\n>>> str.isdigit('1')\nTrue\n\n>>> str.isdecimal('1.0')\nFalse\n>>> str.isdigit('1.0')\nFalse\n\n>>> str.isdecimal('1/2')\nFalse\n>>> str.isdigit('1/2')\nFalse\n```"

        "content": "In Python, both `str.isdecimal()` and `str.isdigit()` are methods used to determine if all characters in a string are decimal or digit characters, respectively. While they may seem similar, there are subtle differences between them in terms of the characters they recognize as valid.\n\nHere's a brief overview of the differences:\n\n1. **`str.isdecimal()`**:\n   - This method checks whether all characters in the string are decimal characters. \n   - Decimal characters are those that can be used to form numbers in base-10 (0-9).\n   - It is more restrictive than `isdigit()`, meaning some characters that are considered digits may not be considered decimal.\n\n2. **`str.isdigit()`**:\n   - This method checks whether all characters in the string are digit characters.\n   - Digit characters include decimal characters and some other characters from Unicode that are classified as digits.\n\nTo illustrate the difference, consider the following examples:\n\n```python\n# Example with a standard digit character\nprint('123'.isdecimal())  # True\nprint('123'.isdigit())    # True\n\n# Example with a superscript (not considered decimal but is a digit)\nsuperscript = '\u00b2'  # Unicode for superscript 2\nprint(superscript.isdecimal())  # False\nprint(superscript.isdigit())    # True\n\n# Example with a fraction (not considered decimal and not a digit)\nfraction = '\u00bc'  # Unicode for fraction one-quarter\nprint(fraction.isdecimal())  # False\nprint(fraction.isdigit())    # False\n```\n\nIn the example above:\n- The superscript '\u00b2' is recognized by `isdigit()` but not by `isdecimal()`, because it's a digit character but not a decimal character.\n- The fraction '\u00bc' is neither a decimal character nor a digit character, so both methods return `False`.\n\nWhen choosing between these two methods, consider what types of numeric characters you expect in your string and choose accordingly. If you only care about standard base-10 numbers, `isdecimal()` might be sufficient. If you need to account for a broader range of numeric characters, `isdigit()` might be more appropriate."
