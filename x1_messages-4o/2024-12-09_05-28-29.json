        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the Django model not being properly associated with an application. When you're using the Django shell, it doesn't automatically know which app context the model belongs to. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Proper App Structure**: Make sure your model is defined within a Django app that is correctly structured and included in your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting in `settings.py`.\n\n2. **Use the Django Shell Correctly**: Instead of defining your model directly in the Django shell, you should define it in the `models.py` file of your app. After that, you can use the Django shell to interact with your model.\n\n3. **Correct Shell Usage**: To work with your models in the Django shell, follow these steps:\n\n   - First, make sure your Django app is properly installed and your project is set up correctly.\n   - Run the Django shell with the following command from your project directory:\n     ```\n     python manage.py shell\n     ```\n   - Import your model in the shell:\n     ```python\n     from your_app_name.models import Poll\n     ```\n\n4. **Migrations**: If you have added a new model or made changes to an existing model, you need to create and apply migrations:\n   \n   - Create the migrations:\n     ```\n     python manage.py makemigrations your_app_name\n     ```\n   - Apply the migrations:\n     ```\n     python manage.py migrate\n     ```\n\nBy ensuring your model is defined within an app and using the Django shell with the correct context, you should be able to avoid the error you're encountering."
