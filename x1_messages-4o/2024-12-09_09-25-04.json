Here's a Python implementation of the selection sort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    # Traverse through all array elements\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        # Find the minimum element in remaining unsorted array\n        min_index = i\n        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):\n            if arr[min_index] > arr[j]:\n                min_index = j\n\n        # Swap the found minimum element with the first element\n        arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]\n\n    return arr\n\n# Example usage\narray = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]\nsorted_array = selection_sort(array)\nprint(\"Sorted array:\", sorted_array)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `selection_sort` that sorts an array in-place. The algorithm repeatedly searches for the smallest element in the unsorted portion of the array and swaps it with the first unsorted element, gradually building up a sorted portion of the array from left to right."
