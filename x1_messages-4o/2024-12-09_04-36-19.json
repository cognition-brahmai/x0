Moreover, I've understood that the file containing the class should be named after the class, but in lowercase, like `foobar.py`. If I need to import this class, I would use `from foobar import FooBar`. However, this convention somewhat confuses me as I feel if the filename is indicating a class, then shouldn't it also begin with a capital letter like `FooBar.py`? Can someone clarify what the standard convention for this is in Python?"

        "content": "In Python, the naming conventions you mentioned are part of the guidelines outlined in PEP 8, which is the style guide for Python code. While these conventions are not strictly enforced, they are widely followed by the Python community to ensure consistency and readability. Let's break down the conventions:\n\n1. **Class Names**: Class names should indeed be written in CamelCase (also known as PascalCase), where each word starts with a capital letter. This makes it easy to distinguish classes from other types of identifiers.\n\n   ```python\n   class FooBar:\n       pass\n   ```\n\n2. **Module (File) Names**: Module names should be short, lowercase, and can include underscores if necessary to improve readability. The reason for using lowercase is to avoid confusion on case-insensitive file systems (e.g., Windows) and to maintain consistency with Python\u2019s standard library modules, which are also lowercase.\n\n   ```plaintext\n   foobar.py\n   ```\n\n3. **Importing Classes**: When importing a class from a module, you use the lowercase module name followed by the class name in CamelCase. This is consistent with how modules and classes are typically used in Python.\n\n   ```python\n   from foobar import FooBar\n   ```\n\n4. **Why Not Capitalized Filenames?**: The choice to use lowercase filenames is largely historical and rooted in the desire for consistency across different operating systems. Python\u2019s standard library follows this convention, and adhering to it helps avoid potential issues on platforms with case-insensitive filesystems.\n\nIn summary, while it might seem more intuitive to name files in CamelCase to match class names, following the lowercase convention for filenames is a matter of adhering to Python's established practices, ensuring compatibility, and maintaining a consistent style across the codebase."
