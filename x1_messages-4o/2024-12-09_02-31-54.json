As an example, the output can look like this: ['hello', 'hallo', 'Hallo', 'hi', 'format'...]. The words in the list should be sorted from closest to furthest. I've tried a method involving enumeration:\n\n```python\nword = 'Hello'\nfor i, item in enumerate(words):\n    if lower(item) > lower(word):\n      ...\n```\n\nBut it's very slow for large lists. Also, I have tried using `difflib` but it's too slow as well (my words list has 630000+ words inside, sorted and one per line). So checking the list takes 5 to 7 seconds for every search for the closest word. How can I improve the performance of this task?"

        "content": "To efficiently find the 'n' closest words to a given string in a large list, you can use a more optimized approach by leveraging a combination of libraries and techniques. One effective way is to use the `Levenshtein distance`, which measures the difference between two sequences. You can use the `rapidfuzz` library, which is a fast implementation for fuzzy string matching.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to improve the performance:\n\n1. **Install `rapidfuzz`:** If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so via pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install rapidfuzz\n   ```\n\n2. **Use `rapidfuzz` for Fuzzy Matching:** This library is faster than `difflib` and provides similar functionality.\n\n3. **Implement the Function:** Calculate the distance for each word and sort them based on that distance.\n\nHere's an implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom rapidfuzz import process\n\ndef find_closest_words(word, words_list, n):\n    # Get the n closest matches\n    matches = process.extract(word, words_list, limit=n)\n    # Extract only the words from the matches\n    closest_words = [match[0] for match in matches]\n    return closest_words\n\nword = \"Hello\"\nwords = ['hello', 'Hallo', 'hi', 'house', 'key', 'screen', 'hallo', 'question', 'Hallo', 'format']\n\n# Find the 5 closest words\nclosest_words = find_closest_words(word, words, 5)\nprint(closest_words)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`process.extract`:** This function returns a list of tuples containing the matched word and its similarity score. Specifying `limit=n` ensures that you only get the top 'n' matches.\n- **Optimized Performance:** `rapidfuzz` is built in C++ and optimized for performance, making it significantly faster than pure Python implementations like `difflib`.\n\nBy using `rapidfuzz`, you should experience a noticeable improvement in performance, especially when dealing with large lists. Adjust the `n` parameter to control the number of closest words you want to retrieve."
