However, I'm struggling to find a way to express binary literals in Python. Can you provide examples for different Python versions?\n\nFor hexadecimal:\n```python\n>>> 0x12AF\n4783\n>>> 0x100\n256\n```\n\nFor octal:\n```python\n>>> 01267\n695\n>>> 0100\n64\n```"

        "content": "In Python, binary literals can be expressed using the `0b` or `0B` prefix. This feature is available starting from Python 2.6 for binary literals. However, note that the support for octal literals with a leading zero (e.g., `01267`) is specific to Python 2.x. Python 3.x uses a different syntax for octal literals, which is `0o` or `0O`.\n\nHere is how you can express binary literals in different Python versions:\n\n### Python 2.6 and Later (including Python 3.x)\n\nFor binary:\n```python\n# Python 2.6 and later (including Python 3.x)\n>>> 0b1010\n10\n>>> 0b1101\n13\n```\n\nFor octal in Python 3.x:\n```python\n# Python 3.x\n>>> 0o1267\n695\n>>> 0o100\n64\n```\n\n### Python 2.x (Before 2.6)\n\nBinary literals are not directly supported in Python versions prior to 2.6. If you are working with Python 2.5 or earlier, you'll need to convert binary strings to integers using `int()`:\n\n```python\n# Python 2.5 and earlier\n>>> int('1010', 2)\n10\n>>> int('1101', 2)\n13\n```\n\nThis way, you can work with binary numbers even in older Python versions by converting binary string representations to integers."
