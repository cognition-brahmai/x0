This function returns a vector with duplicate elements removed, similar to how a 'set' works in Python. Here's an example of how you can use `unique()` in R:\n\n```r\n# Example vector with repeated elements\nvector <- c(1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5)\n\n# Remove repeated elements\nunique_vector <- unique(vector)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(unique_vector)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, `unique_vector` will contain only the unique elements from the original `vector`, which would be `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`."
