The tutorial refers to built-in functions like `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `str()`, and `len()` which are used on or to create strings. Coming from a C++ background, I would consider `.upper()` and `.lower()` as methods and `len()` and `str()` as functions. However, these terms seem to be used interchangeably in the tutorial. Does Python distinguish between methods and functions in the same way as C++?"

        "content": "In Python, the distinction between methods and functions is similar to that in C++, but there are some nuances. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Functions**:\n   - In Python, a function is a block of reusable code that is called by name. It can take arguments, perform an action, and return a value. Functions in Python are defined using the `def` keyword.\n   - Examples of functions include `len()`, `str()`, and any other standalone function that can be called without being associated with a particular object.\n\n2. **Methods**:\n   - A method in Python is similar to a function, but it is associated with an object. Methods are functions that are called on objects and can access and modify the object's state.\n   - Methods belong to an object\u2019s class and are defined within a class. They can operate on data contained within the object. \n   - Examples of methods are string methods like `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.append()` for lists, etc. These are called on the object and perform operations using the object's data.\n\nIn summary, the key difference is that methods are functions that are called on objects, while functions are standalone and not bound to a particular object. In your example:\n- `.upper()` and `.lower()` are methods because they are called on string objects and operate on those specific objects.\n- `len()` and `str()` are functions because they don't belong to a specific object; instead, they can be used with a variety of objects.\n\nWhile in many contexts, especially in tutorials and less formal documentation, the terms \"function\" and \"method\" might be used interchangeably, it's helpful to remember this distinction when working with Python, especially in object-oriented programming."
