        "content": "To add a specific number of business days to a given date in Python while ignoring weekends and holidays, you can use the `pandas` library, which has convenient date manipulation capabilities. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n1. Install the `pandas` library if you haven't already:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pandas\n   ```\n\n2. Use the `CustomBusinessDay` feature in `pandas` to define your custom business days, taking into account weekends and holidays.\n\nHere's a sample code snippet demonstrating how to add business days to a given date:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessDay\n\n# Define a list of holidays\nholidays = [\n    \"2023-01-01\",  # New Year's Day\n    \"2023-01-26\",  # Republic Day (India)\n    \"2023-08-15\",  # Independence Day (India)\n    \"2023-10-02\",  # Gandhi Jayanti (India)\n    # Add more holidays as needed\n]\n\n# Convert holidays to datetime objects\nholidays = pd.to_datetime(holidays)\n\n# Create a CustomBusinessDay object\ncustom_business_day = CustomBusinessDay(holidays=holidays)\n\n# Function to add business days\ndef add_business_days(start_date, num_business_days):\n    start_date = pd.to_datetime(start_date)\n    end_date = start_date + num_business_days * custom_business_day\n    return end_date\n\n# Example usage\nstart_date = \"2023-09-29\"  # A Friday\nnum_business_days = 5\nresult_date = add_business_days(start_date, num_business_days)\n\nprint(f\"Start Date: {start_date}\")\nprint(f\"End Date after adding {num_business_days} business days: {result_date}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- `CustomBusinessDay` is used to define what a business day is, considering any given holidays.\n- The `holidays` list contains the dates you want to exclude as non-working days.\n- The `add_business_days` function calculates the end date by adding the desired number of business days to the start date.\n\nFeel free to modify the list of holidays to match your specific requirements."
