Can you provide me with a list of all 50 states in the United States of America, including their abbreviations, without using the letters 'A' or 'E' in any of the state names or abbreviations? And just to make it more challenging, can you also provide the sum of the ASCII values of the first letter of each state name? Good luck!"

Illinois (IL)\n3. Missouri (MO)\n4. Mississippi (MS)\n\nNow, let's find the sum of the ASCII values of the first letters of these states:\n\n- O (Ohio) = 79\n- I (Illinois) = 73\n- M (Missouri) = 77\n- M (Mississippi) = 77\n\nSum of ASCII values = 79 + 73 + 77 + 77 = 306\n\nSo, the states without 'A' or 'E' in their names or abbreviations are Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, and Mississippi, and the sum of the ASCII values of their first letters is 306."
