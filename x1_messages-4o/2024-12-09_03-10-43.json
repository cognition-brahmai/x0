I'm running a virtual machine on GCP with a Tesla GPU and trying to deploy a PyTorch-based app to accelerate it with the GPU. I have installed all drivers on the host machine and the app runs fine there, but when I try to run it in Docker (based on the NVIDIA/CUDA container), PyTorch fails. The error message is \"Found no NVIDIA driver on your system.\" When I run \"docker run --runtime=nvidia --rm nvidia/cuda nvidia-smi\", it complains \"docker: Error response from daemon: Unknown runtime specified nvidia.\" If I check my runtimes in Docker, I only get \"runc\" runtime, not \"nvidia\". Restarting the Docker daemon doesn't help. How can I add the NVIDIA runtime environment to my Docker?"

        "content": "To add the NVIDIA runtime environment to your Docker setup and address the issue you're encountering, you'll need to follow several steps to ensure that your Docker is correctly configured to use NVIDIA GPUs. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Install NVIDIA Container Toolkit**: This toolkit allows Docker to interface with NVIDIA GPUs. Follow these steps to install it:\n\n   - First, update your package list:\n     ```bash\n     sudo apt-get update\n     ```\n\n   - Then, install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit:\n     ```bash\n     distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID)\n     curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -\n     curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/$distribution/nvidia-docker.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.list\n     sudo apt-get update\n     sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-docker2\n     ```\n\n2. **Restart Docker**: After installing the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, you need to restart the Docker daemon to apply changes:\n   ```bash\n   sudo systemctl restart docker\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify Installation**: You can verify that the NVIDIA runtime is available by running the following command:\n   ```bash\n   docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:11.0-base nvidia-smi\n   ```\n\n   This command should display information about the NVIDIA GPU, confirming that Docker can access the GPU.\n\n4. **Adjust Docker Command**: When running your Docker container, use the `--gpus` flag instead of `--runtime=nvidia` (as the latter is deprecated):\n\n   ```bash\n   docker run --gpus all your-docker-image\n   ```\n\n5. **Ensure Compatibility**: Make sure that the version of the `nvidia-docker2` package matches your installed GPU drivers and CUDA version. This is crucial for compatibility.\n\n6. **Check Permissions**: Ensure that your user has the necessary permissions to access the Docker daemon and the GPU. You might need to add your user to the `docker` group:\n   ```bash\n   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n   ```\n\n   Log out and back in for the group change to take effect.\n\n7. **Verify CUDA and PyTorch**: Ensure that the versions of CUDA and PyTorch in your Docker container are compatible with the versions on your host machine.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully add the NVIDIA runtime environment to your Docker setup and run your PyTorch-based app with GPU acceleration."
