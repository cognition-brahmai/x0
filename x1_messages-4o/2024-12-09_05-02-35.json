Here is an example:\n\n```python\n@property\ndef get_foo(self) -> Foo:\n    return self._foo\n```\nIn the above, `self._foo` is an instance of Foo. I'm guessing this might be a static type declaration indicating that `self._foo` is of type Foo. However, when I tested this and `self._foo` was not an instance of Foo, nothing unusual happened. Also, if `self._foo` is a type other than Foo, such as an `int`, then `type(SomeClass.get_foo())` returns `int`. So, what is the purpose of \"-> Foo\" in this context? I've found it difficult to research this concept as the symbol doesn't have a common name, and referring to it as an \"arrow\" is somewhat misleading."

        "content": "The `->` symbol in Python, often referred to as an \"arrow\", is part of the function annotation syntax introduced in PEP 3107. Specifically, it is used to indicate the return type of a function or method. In your example:\n\n```python\n@property\ndef get_foo(self) -> Foo:\n    return self._foo\n```\n\n`-> Foo` is a type hint that suggests the method `get_foo` is expected to return an instance of the class `Foo`. This is part of Python's type hinting system, which allows developers to specify the expected types for function arguments and return values.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that type hints are not enforced by Python at runtime. They are primarily for the benefit of developers and tools like linters, type checkers (such as `mypy`), and IDEs that can provide static type checking, code completion, and other code analysis features.\n\nSo, if `self._foo` is not actually of type `Foo`, Python will not raise an error at runtime. The type hint serves as documentation and can help with static analysis but does not affect the execution of the code.\n\nTo use type hints effectively, you can employ tools that check the type annotations against the actual code. This can help catch type mismatches and other potential errors during development, rather than at runtime."
