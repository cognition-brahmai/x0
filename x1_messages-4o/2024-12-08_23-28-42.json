        "content": "Certainly! To determine the minimum distance a driver must travel to earn $5, you need to know the fixed rate per mile that the ride-sharing app pays its drivers. Let's denote this rate as \\( r \\) dollars per mile.\n\nThe relationship between the distance traveled (in miles) and the total payment is given by the equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Payment} = \\text{Rate per Mile} \\times \\text{Distance} \\]\n\nLet's set the total payment to $5 and denote the distance traveled as \\( d \\). The equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 5 = r \\times d \\]\n\nTo find the distance \\( d \\), you can rearrange the equation to solve for \\( d \\):\n\n\\[ d = \\frac{5}{r} \\]\n\nThis equation shows that the distance \\( d \\) required to earn $5 is equal to $5 divided by the rate per mile \\( r \\). Once you know the rate per mile, you can use this equation to calculate the exact number of miles needed."
