I am having trouble understanding the exact order of operations, such as when to copy the models over to `new_app`, when to delete the models from `old_app`, and how to manage the migrations within `old_app.migrations` versus `new_app.migrations`."

        "content": "Moving models between Django applications, especially when dealing with foreign key dependencies, requires careful planning to ensure data integrity and consistency. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you navigate this process:\n\n1. **Plan the Migration:**\n   - Understand the dependencies between your models. This includes foreign key relationships and any other constraints.\n\n2. **Copy Models to `new_app`:**\n   - Copy the model classes from `old_app/models.py` to `new_app/models.py`.\n   - Ensure that any import statements and related configurations are updated to reflect the new app structure.\n\n3. **Create Initial Migration in `new_app`:**\n   - Run `python manage.py makemigrations new_app`. This will create initial migration files for the models in `new_app`.\n\n4. **Adjust Foreign Key References:**\n   - If your models in `new_app` have foreign key references to models still in `old_app`, update these references to point to `new_app` models. This will involve editing the model fields to reflect the new app label.\n\n5. **Create a Data Migration:**\n   - Create a custom data migration to handle the transfer of data from `old_app` to `new_app`. You can do this by running `python manage.py makemigrations --empty new_app` to create an empty migration file.\n   - In the generated migration file, write logic to transfer data from `old_app` tables to `new_app` tables using the `RunPython` operation.\n\n6. **Update `old_app`:**\n   - Remove the models from `old_app/models.py` after ensuring that data and schema have been correctly migrated to `new_app`.\n   - Create a new migration in `old_app` to handle the removal of these models. Run `python manage.py makemigrations old_app`.\n\n7. **Run Migrations:**\n   - Apply the migrations for both `new_app` and `old_app` by running `python manage.py migrate`. Ensure that you run these migrations in the correct order to avoid dependency issues.\n\n8. **Testing:**\n   - Thoroughly test your application to ensure that the data has been correctly migrated and that all functionalities are working as expected.\n   - Check for any broken foreign key relationships or missing data.\n\n9. **Clean Up:**\n   - Remove any unused files or references in both applications after confirming the migration is successful.\n\n10. **Version Control:**\n    - Commit your changes to version control at each significant step to ensure you can rollback if necessary.\n\nBy following these steps, you can systematically move your models from one Django app to another, managing both the data and schema changes effectively."
