I'm having trouble authenticating after making the connection using the StrictRedis method. The code I'm using:\n\n```python\nimport redis\nr = redis.StrictRedis()\nr.auth('pass')\n```\n\nthrows an error stating that the 'StrictRedis' object has no attribute 'auth'. I also tried `r = redis.StrictRedis(auth='pass')`, but that doesn't work either as there's no such keyword argument. From my experience with Redis binding in other languages, the method name usually coincides with the Redis command, so I assumed `r.auth` would send `AUTH`, but it seems it doesn't have this method. What is the standard way of using `AUTH` in redis-py? Additionally, could you explain what 'Strict' means in 'StrictRedis'?"

        "content": "It seems you're running into an issue because the `redis-py` library handles authentication a bit differently than you might expect. In `redis-py`, authentication is typically done at the time of initializing the `StrictRedis` (or `Redis`) instance by providing the password as a parameter. You don't need to call an `AUTH` command explicitly after creating the connection. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport redis\n\n# Initialize the connection with the password\nr = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=6379, password='your_password')\n\n# Now you can use 'r' to interact with your Redis server\n```\n\nReplace `'your_password'` with the actual password for your Redis server. You can also specify `host` and `port` if your Redis server is not running on the default settings.\n\nRegarding your second question, the `StrictRedis` class in `redis-py` enforces a more strict interpretation of the Redis command arguments and responses, closely mimicking the behavior of the Redis server. It is designed to provide users with a predictable and consistent experience that closely aligns with the actual Redis command syntax. In earlier versions of `redis-py`, there was also a `Redis` class that was less strict about how it handled certain commands, but the `StrictRedis` class is now the recommended choice, and the `Redis` class is effectively an alias for `StrictRedis` in more recent versions of the library."
