        "content": "To run a Python function directly from the command line, you can use a couple of different approaches. Here's a straightforward method to execute the `hello` function from your example:\n\n1. **Using a Script File:**\n\n   First, create a Python script file (e.g., `script.py`) containing your function and a small piece of code to call the function. Here's how you can structure it:\n\n   ```python\n   def hello():\n       return 'Hi :)'\n\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       print(hello())\n   ```\n\n   Then, you can run this script from the command line by navigating to the directory containing `script.py` and executing:\n\n   ```bash\n   python script.py\n   ```\n\n   This will output:\n\n   ```\n   Hi :)\n   ```\n\n2. **Directly from the Command Line:**\n\n   If you don't want to create a separate file, you can use Python's `-c` flag to execute a command directly from the command line. Here's how you can do it:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -c \"def hello(): return 'Hi :)'; print(hello())\"\n   ```\n\n   This command defines the function and immediately calls it, printing its return value.\n\nBoth methods will allow you to execute the `hello()` function directly from the command line."
