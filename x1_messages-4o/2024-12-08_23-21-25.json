        "content": "To correctly form passive voice sentences, you follow a specific structure where the object of an active sentence becomes the subject of the passive sentence. The basic structure for forming a passive voice sentence is:\n\n**Subject + form of \"to be\" + past participle + (by + agent).**\n\n1. **Identify the object of the active sentence:** In an active sentence, the subject performs the action on the object.\n2. **Make the object the subject of the sentence:** The object of the active sentence becomes the subject of the passive sentence.\n3. **Use the appropriate form of \"to be\":** The form of \"to be\" must match the tense of the verb in the active sentence.\n4. **Use the past participle of the main verb.**\n5. **Optionally, include the agent:** The person or thing performing the action can be included after \"by.\"\n\nLet's analyze the examples given:\n\na) **The cake was baked by Mary.**\n   - This sentence is in the passive voice. \"The cake\" is the subject, \"was baked\" is the past participle form of \"to bake,\" and \"by Mary\" indicates the agent. This sentence correctly follows the passive voice structure.\n\nb) **Mary baked the cake.**\n   - This sentence is in the active voice, not the passive voice. Here, \"Mary\" is the subject performing the action, and \"the cake\" is the object. The sentence structure is subject-verb-object, which is typical for active voice.\n\nc) **Baked by Mary was the cake.**\n   - Although this sentence can be understood, its structure is awkward and not typically used in English passive voice construction. The natural and grammatically correct passive voice structure would be \"The cake was baked by Mary.\"\n\n**More examples of passive voice sentences:**\n\n1. The book was read by John.\n2. The song was sung by the choir.\n3. The homework was completed by the students.\n4. A delicious meal was prepared by the chef.\n5. The report was written by the team.\n\nIn each of these examples, the object of the active sentence becomes the subject of the passive sentence, and the focus is on the action being done to the subject, rather than who is performing the action."
