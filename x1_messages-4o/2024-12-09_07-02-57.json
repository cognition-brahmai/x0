I have a 2.1 GPU, GTX 500 ti and I've set the block count up to 192000 in my application where I run a kernel like this: `kernel<<< BLOCKS,THREADS >>>()`. The kernel changes the contents of a huge array. Although I checked some parts of the array and they seemed fine, I'm unsure whether the kernel behaved strangely at other parts. Is the block count of 192000 within the permissible limit or is there a specific maximum number available for BLOCKS when we do not use dim3 objects?"

        "content": "In CUDA, the maximum number of blocks you can launch in a kernel grid is determined by the compute capability of your GPU. For your GTX 550 Ti, which has a compute capability of 2.1, there are specific limitations you need to be aware of:\n\n1. **Grid Size**: For GPUs with compute capability 2.x, the maximum grid size in the x-dimension is 65535 blocks. This means you cannot launch more than 65535 blocks in a single dimension.\n\n2. **Threads per Block**: Each block can have a maximum of 1024 threads.\n\nIf you are launching 192,000 blocks, you are likely exceeding the maximum grid size allowed by your GPU's compute capability. This could cause your application to behave unexpectedly or not run at all. To handle more computation, you should consider using multiple dimensions for your grid. For example, you can use a two-dimensional grid where each dimension is within the limits, like `dim3 grid(65535, 3)`.\n\nIf you need to process a large dataset, make sure you adjust your grid and block configuration to fit within these limitations, and consider breaking your problem into smaller chunks if necessary. Additionally, always check for any CUDA errors in your code using error checking functions like `cudaGetLastError()` to ensure that your kernel launches are successful."
