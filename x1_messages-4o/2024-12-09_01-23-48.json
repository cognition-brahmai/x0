The code is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nfrom statsmodels.sandbox.regression.predstd import wls_prediction_std\n\nn = 100\n\nx = np.linspace(0, 10, n)\ne = np.random.normal(size=n)\ny = 1 + 0.5*x + 2*e\nX = sm.add_constant(x)\n\nre = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()\nprint(re.summary())\n\nprstd, iv_l, iv_u = wls_prediction_std(re)\n```\n\nMy question is about `iv_l` and `iv_u`. Are these the upper and lower confidence intervals or prediction intervals? How can I get the other type of intervals (either confidence or prediction) if `iv_l` and `iv_u` are not the ones I need? I require these intervals for all points, so I can create a plot."

        "content": "In the code you provided, `iv_l` and `iv_u` are the lower and upper bounds of the **prediction intervals** for the fitted values. Prediction intervals provide a range within which we expect future observations to fall, considering both the uncertainty in the estimation of the mean response and the variability of the observations themselves.\n\nIf you need the **confidence intervals** for the mean response instead, you can obtain them using the `get_prediction` method available in StatsModels. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nn = 100\n\nx = np.linspace(0, 10, n)\ne = np.random.normal(size=n)\ny = 1 + 0.5*x + 2*e\nX = sm.add_constant(x)\n\nre = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()\nprint(re.summary())\n\n# Prediction for all points with confidence intervals\npred = re.get_prediction(X)\npred_conf_int = pred.conf_int()\n\n# Extract the lower and upper bounds for confidence intervals\nconf_int_l = pred_conf_int[:, 0]\nconf_int_u = pred_conf_int[:, 1]\n\n# Plotting\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.scatter(x, y, label='Data')\nplt.plot(x, re.fittedvalues, 'r--', label='Fitted line')\nplt.fill_between(x, conf_int_l, conf_int_u, color='gray', alpha=0.3, label='Confidence Interval')\nplt.fill_between(x, iv_l, iv_u, color='yellow', alpha=0.2, label='Prediction Interval')\nplt.xlabel('X')\nplt.ylabel('Y')\nplt.title('Linear Regression with Confidence and Prediction Intervals')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- We use `get_prediction` on the fitted model `re`, which provides predictions and associated statistics.\n- `pred.conf_int()` gives the confidence intervals for the predicted mean response.\n- We then plot both the confidence intervals (in gray) and prediction intervals (in yellow) to visualize the uncertainty in predictions.\n\nBy using `get_prediction`, you can access both types of intervals and choose the one that suits your needs for analysis and visualization."
