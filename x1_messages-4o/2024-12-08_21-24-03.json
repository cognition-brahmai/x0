        "content": "To sort the list of fruits based on their color and price in C++, while ensuring that only fruits with a weight greater than 1 kg are included in the sorting process, you can use the following approach. This involves filtering the fruits based on their weight, and then sorting the filtered list using a custom comparator function. Here's a step-by-step C++ code that accomplishes this:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <tuple>\n#include <algorithm>\n\nint main() {\n    // Define the vector of fruits with name, color, and weight\n    std::vector<std::tuple<std::string, std::string, double>> fruits = {\n        {\"Banana\", \"Yellow\", 2},\n        {\"Grape\", \"Purple\", 5},\n        {\"Apple\", \"Red\", 1.5}\n    };\n\n    // Filter out fruits with weight <= 1 kg\n    std::vector<std::tuple<std::string, std::string, double>> filteredFruits;\n    for (const auto& fruit : fruits) {\n        if (std::get<2>(fruit) > 1.0) {\n            filteredFruits.push_back(fruit);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Sort the filtered fruits by color and then by price in ascending order\n    std::sort(filteredFruits.begin(), filteredFruits.end(), [](const auto& a, const auto& b) {\n        if (std::get<1>(a) == std::get<1>(b)) {\n            return std::get<2>(a) < std::get<2>(b);\n        }\n        return std::get<1>(a) < std::get<1>(b);\n    });\n\n    // Print the sorted fruits\n    for (const auto& fruit : filteredFruits) {\n        std::cout << std::get<0>(fruit) << \" (\" << std::get<1>(fruit) << \", \" << std::get<2>(fruit) << \" kg)\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Define the Vector**: We start by defining a vector of tuples, where each tuple contains the fruit's name, color, and weight.\n\n2. **Filter the Fruits**: We create a new vector `filteredFruits` to store only those fruits whose weight is greater than 1 kg. This is done using a simple loop to check the weight of each fruit.\n\n3. **Sort the Fruits**: We use the `std::sort` function with a custom comparator. The comparator first compares the color of the fruits. If the colors are the same, it then compares the price (which is the weight in this case, given the context) to sort them in ascending order.\n\n4. **Print the Results**: Finally, we print the sorted list of fruits to the console.\n\nThis code will output the fruits sorted by color and price, ensuring only those with a weight greater than 1 kg are considered."
