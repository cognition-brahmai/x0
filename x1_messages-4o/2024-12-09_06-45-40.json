The code I use is `netc[\"DeltaAMPP\"] = netc.LOAD_AM - netc.VPP12_AM`. However, I am encountering a `SettingWithCopyWarning` that says, \"A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame. Try using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead\". I am using pandas version '0.19.2+0.g825876c.dirty'. What is the proper way to create a new field in this version of Pandas to avoid getting the warning?"

        "content": "The `SettingWithCopyWarning` in pandas is a common warning that occurs when you try to modify a DataFrame that is a slice of another DataFrame. This warning is meant to alert you to the fact that you might be modifying a view rather than a copy, which can lead to unexpected behavior. \n\nTo avoid this warning, you can use the `.loc` indexer to ensure that you're performing the operation on the intended DataFrame. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nnetc.loc[:, \"DeltaAMPP\"] = netc[\"LOAD_AM\"] - netc[\"VPP12_AM\"]\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that you are explicitly indicating that you want to add a new column to the `netc` DataFrame. The `:` in `.loc[:, \"DeltaAMPP\"]` indicates that you want to apply the operation to all rows in the DataFrame.\n\nIf `netc` is indeed a copy of a slice from another DataFrame, you might want to explicitly create a copy of it using the `.copy()` method to avoid any further confusion. Here\u2019s how you can do that:\n\n```python\nnetc = netc.copy()\nnetc[\"DeltaAMPP\"] = netc[\"LOAD_AM\"] - netc[\"VPP12_AM\"]\n```\n\nBy using `.copy()`, you ensure that `netc` is a separate DataFrame and that modifications to it will not affect the original DataFrame from which it was sliced. This should help avoid the `SettingWithCopyWarning`."
