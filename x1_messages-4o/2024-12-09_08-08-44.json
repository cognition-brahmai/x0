I am trying to create a 'Reader' alternative to read data from Azure SQL Database using the 'Execute python script' module in Azure ML. I am using pyodbc library to connect to Azure SQL. I have tried the drivers \"{SQL Server}\", \"{SQL Server Native Client 11.0}\" and \"{SQL Server Native Client 10.0}\" but keep getting the following error: ('IM002', '[IM002] [Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Data source name not found and no default driver specified (0) (SQLDriverConnect)').\n\nHere's the code I've been trying: \n\n```python\ndef azureml_main(dataframe1 = None, dataframe2 = None):\n    import pyodbc   \n    import pandas as pd\n\n    conn = pyodbc.connect('DRIVER={SQL Server}; SERVER=server.database.windows.net; DATABASE=db_name; UID=user; PWD=Password')\n    SQLCommand = ('''select * from table1 ''')\n    data_frame = pd.read_sql(SQLCommand, conn)\n    return data_frame,\n```\n\nI also tried using a different connection string format:\n\n```python\nconn = pyodbc.connect('DRIVER={SQL Server}; SERVER=server.database.windows.net; DATABASE=db_name; user=user@server; password=Password')\n```\n\nand \n\n```python\nconn = pyodbc.connect('DRIVER={SQL Server Native Client 11.0}; SERVER=server.database.windows.net; DATABASE=db_name; user=user@server; password=Password')\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that the ODBC driver specified in your connection string is not found on the system where your code is running. To connect to Azure SQL Database using pyodbc, you should ensure that you are using the correct ODBC driver that is compatible with Azure SQL.\n\nFor Azure SQL Database, you typically should use the \"ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server\" or a newer version if available. Here's how you can modify your connection string to use this driver:\n\n```python\ndef azureml_main(dataframe1 = None, dataframe2 = None):\n    import pyodbc   \n    import pandas as pd\n\n    conn = pyodbc.connect('DRIVER={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server}; SERVER=server.database.windows.net; DATABASE=db_name; UID=user; PWD=Password')\n    SQLCommand = ('''select * from table1 ''')\n    data_frame = pd.read_sql(SQLCommand, conn)\n    return data_frame,\n```\n\n### Additional Steps:\n\n1. **Install the ODBC Driver**: Ensure that the \"ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server\" is installed on your Azure ML environment. If you're running this in a local environment, you can download it from Microsoft's official website.\n\n2. **Check the Environment**: If you're using Azure Machine Learning Studio, you might have to ensure that the compute environment has the necessary drivers installed. You might need to create a custom environment with the required drivers.\n\n3. **Troubleshoot Authentication**:\n   - Make sure the username and password are correct.\n   - Ensure the user has permission to access the database.\n   - Confirm that the firewall settings of Azure SQL Database allow connections from the Azure ML service.\n\n4. **Test Locally**: If possible, try running your script in a local environment where you have more control over the installation of drivers to ensure the script works there before deploying it to Azure ML.\n\nBy using the appropriate driver and ensuring it's installed in your environment, you should be able to connect to Azure SQL Database without the data source name error."
