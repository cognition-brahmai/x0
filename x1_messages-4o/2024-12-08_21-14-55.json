Note that this is a basic implementation and might not cover all grammatical nuances.\n\n```python\ndef convert_to_active(sentence):\n    words = sentence.split()\n    passive_markers = [\"was\", \"were\", \"is\", \"are\", \"being\", \"been\", \"by\"]\n    active_sentence = []\n\n    for i, word in enumerate(words):\n        if word in passive_markers and i + 1 < len(words) and words[i + 1] == \"by\":\n            # Swap subject and object\n            subject = words[i + 2:]\n            verb = words[i - 1]\n            object_ = words[:i - 1]\n            active_sentence = subject + \" \" + verb + \" \" + object_\n            break\n\n    return ' '.join(active_sentence) if active_sentence else sentence\n\n# Example usage\npassive_sentence = \"The Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to Bob by the committee.\"\nactive_sentence = convert_to_active(passive_sentence)\nprint(active_sentence)  # Output: \"The committee awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature to Bob.\"\n```\n\nThis code provides a simple transformation of a passive sentence to an active one by identifying passive markers and restructuring the sentence. However, for complex sentences, a more sophisticated natural language processing technique would be required."
