        "content": "In Python, you can achieve this by using a list comprehension to filter the items that start with the specific string \"GFS01_\". Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Sample list of items\nitems = [\n    \"GFS01_06-13-2017 05-10-18-38.csv\",\n    \"Metadata_GFS01_06-13-2017 05-10-18-38.csv\",\n    \"GFS01_07-14-2018 06-11-19-40.csv\",\n    \"OtherFile_08-15-2019 07-12-20-42.csv\"\n]\n\n# Filter items that start with \"GFS01_\"\nfiltered_items = [item for item in items if item.startswith(\"GFS01_\")]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(filtered_items)\n```\n\nIn this code, `startswith(\"GFS01_\")` is used to check if each item in the list starts with the string \"GFS01_\". The list comprehension iterates through all items in the list and includes only those that match the condition. The result is then stored in `filtered_items`, which you can print or use further in your code."
