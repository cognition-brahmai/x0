        "content": "What does the \"G\" and \"C\" type signify in nvidia-smi? I have an open issue where I initially thought that my cuda code wasn't running on my GPU. This confusion arose because I noted a \"C\" in the type field of my process when I utilized nvidia-smi. However, I also observed that my GPU-Util grows when I execute my code. As a result, I am uncertain whether my code is running on the CPU or GPU. I came across this explanation: \"Displayed as 'C' for Compute Process, 'G' for Graphics Process, and 'C+G' for the process having both Compute and Graphics contexts.\" But, I am still unclear whether \"C\" is for CPU and \"G\" is for GPU, as the terms \"compute process\" and \"graphics process\" are unfamiliar to me. Could someone clarify what precisely the \"C\" or \"G\" type represents and the differences between \"compute process\" and \"graphics process\"?"

        "content": "In the context of `nvidia-smi`, the \"C\" and \"G\" types do not refer to CPU or GPU directly. Instead, they represent the type of process running on the GPU:\n\n1. **C (Compute Process):** This indicates that the process is utilizing the GPU for compute operations. This typically involves running tasks that require parallel computation, such as scientific simulations, machine learning model training, or other general-purpose computing tasks that benefit from the GPU's parallel processing capabilities. When you see \"C\" in the `nvidia-smi` output, it means the process is using the GPU for computation.\n\n2. **G (Graphics Process):** This signifies that the process is using the GPU for rendering graphics. This is common for applications related to gaming, 3D rendering, video playback, or any other tasks that involve graphical rendering.\n\n3. **C+G (Compute and Graphics):** If a process shows \"C+G\", it means that it is using the GPU for both compute and graphics tasks simultaneously.\n\nIn your case, seeing a \"C\" means your code is using the GPU for compute tasks, which is what you want for CUDA-based applications. The fact that your GPU utilization is increasing when you run your code further supports that your application is running on the GPU. So, there is no indication that your code is running on the CPU based on the \"C\" designation in `nvidia-smi`."
