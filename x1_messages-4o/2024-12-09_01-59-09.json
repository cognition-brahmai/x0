        "content": "To install Geckodriver for Selenium in Python on a Windows 7 32-bit system, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Download Geckodriver**: \n   - Go to the [Geckodriver releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases).\n   - Download the appropriate version for your system. Since you are on a 32-bit Windows, look for a file named `geckodriver-vX.YY.ZZ-win32.zip`, where `X.YY.ZZ` is the version number.\n\n2. **Extract the Zip File**:\n   - Use a tool like WinRAR or 7-Zip to extract the contents of the downloaded zip file.\n   - Extract the `geckodriver.exe` file to a directory of your choice. For simplicity, you might want to extract it to a directory like `C:\\geckodriver`.\n\n3. **Add Geckodriver to PATH**:\n   - Right-click on \"Computer\" or \"This PC\" on your desktop or in File Explorer, then select \"Properties\".\n   - Click on \"Advanced system settings\" on the left.\n   - In the System Properties window, click on the \"Environment Variables\" button.\n   - In the Environment Variables window, find the \"Path\" variable in the \"System variables\" section and select it, then click \"Edit\".\n   - Add the directory where you extracted `geckodriver.exe` (e.g., `C:\\geckodriver`) to the PATH variable. Separate it from existing entries with a semicolon (`;`).\n\n4. **Verify Geckodriver Installation**:\n   - Open a Command Prompt and type `geckodriver --version`. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the version information for Geckodriver.\n\n5. **Using Geckodriver with Selenium**:\n   - In your Python script, make sure you have the Selenium package installed. If not, you can install it using Anaconda by running `conda install -c conda-forge selenium` in Anaconda Prompt.\n   - Use the following Python code to initiate a Firefox browser session with Selenium:\n\n     ```python\n     from selenium import webdriver\n\n     # Set the path for geckodriver if it's not in the PATH\n     # driver = webdriver.Firefox(executable_path=r'C:\\geckodriver\\geckodriver.exe')\n     \n     # If Geckodriver is added to PATH, you can simply do:\n     driver = webdriver.Firefox()\n\n     driver.get('https://www.google.com')\n     print(driver.title)\n     driver.quit()\n     ```\n\nIf you still encounter the \"FileNotFoundError\", ensure that the path to `geckodriver.exe` is correctly specified in the `executable_path` parameter if it\u2019s not added to PATH, and double-check that you have permissions to execute files in the directory where `geckodriver.exe` is located. Additionally, verify that your Firefox browser is compatible with the version of Geckodriver you're using."
