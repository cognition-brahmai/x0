I am looking for something similar to the `date` command, but I want the output to be in seconds since 1970, not the current date, hours, minutes, and seconds. I can't find an option in `date` that provides this. Is there a simple way to achieve this?"

You can achieve this by using the `+%s` format option. Here's the command you need:\n\n```bash\ndate +%s\n```\n\nThis command will output the current time in seconds since the Unix Epoch. It uses the `+%s` format option to instruct the `date` command to display the time in this specific format."
