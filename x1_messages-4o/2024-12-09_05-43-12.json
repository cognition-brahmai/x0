Here's my code:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\n\nspam = OrderedDict(s = (1, 2), p = (3, 4), a = (5, 6), m = (7, 8))\n\nspam\n# Outputs: OrderedDict([('a', (5, 6)), ('p', (3, 4)), ('s', (1, 2)), ('m', (7, 8))])\n\nfor key in spam.keys():\n   print key    \n# Outputs: \n# a\n# p\n# s\n# m\n```\n\nI was expecting the order to be \"s\", \"p\", \"a\", \"m\", which is the order I used when initializing the OrderedDict. Could someone explain why this is happening and how can I get the order I wanted?"

        "content": "The behavior you're experiencing is due to the way Python handles keyword arguments. When you pass keyword arguments to a function or class constructor, they are passed as a regular dictionary, which does not preserve the order of elements. This means that by the time the `OrderedDict` sees the inputs, they might already be out of order because the standard dictionary used to pass them does not maintain order.\n\nTo ensure that the `OrderedDict` is initialized with the order you specify, you should pass an iterable of key-value pairs, such as a list of tuples. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired order:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\n\n# Use a list of tuples to maintain order\nspam = OrderedDict([('s', (1, 2)), ('p', (3, 4)), ('a', (5, 6)), ('m', (7, 8))])\n\nprint(spam)\n# Outputs: OrderedDict([('s', (1, 2)), ('p', (3, 4)), ('a', (5, 6)), ('m', (7, 8))])\n\nfor key in spam.keys():\n    print(key)\n# Outputs: \n# s\n# p\n# a\n# m\n```\n\nBy using a list of tuples, the order is preserved, and your `OrderedDict` will reflect the order in which you specified the elements."
