The value gets set when I load my virtualenv and I can confirm its presence from `python manage.py shell`. When I run the Django Console, `SECRET_KEY` is missing, which is expected. I've gone to preferences, then to Console>Django Console and loaded `SECRET_KEY` with the appropriate value. Now, the Django Console recognizes the `SECRET_KEY`. However, when I try to run a manage.py Task, it still can't find the `SECRET_KEY`, even though I've added it into Django server and Django Tests, and into the project server via Run>Edit Configurations. Even after restarting PyCharm and confirming the keys, I still get a `KeyError: 'SECRET_KEY'` when running a manage.py Task such as `runserver`. Where should I put this key to avoid the error?"

        "content": "When dealing with Django and environment variables like `SECRET_KEY`, it's important to ensure they're accessible in all contexts where your Django application runs. Here's a checklist to help you resolve the `KeyError: 'SECRET_KEY'` you're encountering in PyCharm:\n\n1. **Environment Variables in Shell**: Confirm that the environment variable is set in the shell you're using. If you're using a `.env` file, ensure it's properly loaded. You can use tools like `django-environ` or `python-decouple` to manage environment variables effectively.\n\n2. **PyCharm Environment Configuration**:\n   - Open PyCharm's **Run/Debug Configurations** (Run > Edit Configurations).\n   - Ensure that the environment variable `SECRET_KEY` is set for the specific configuration you're using to run `manage.py` tasks. This includes configurations for `runserver`, `shell`, or any custom task you've set up. You can add it under the \"Environment Variables\" section.\n\n3. **Manage.py Configuration**:\n   - If you have multiple configurations (e.g., `runserver`, `shell`), ensure each has the `SECRET_KEY` set.\n   - You can create a global environment variable configuration in PyCharm that applies to all your Django configurations.\n\n4. **Terminal vs. Console**:\n   - Ensure that the terminal and the console in PyCharm are both configured to use the same virtual environment and have access to the same environment variables.\n\n5. **Project Settings**:\n   - Double-check your Django settings file to ensure `SECRET_KEY` is being read from the environment correctly. A typical configuration would be:\n     ```python\n     import os\n\n     SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')\n     ```\n\n6. **System Environment Variables**:\n   - As a last resort, you can set the environment variable at the system level, ensuring it's available to all processes. This depends on your operating system (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc` for Unix-like systems, or Environment Variables settings on Windows).\n\n7. **Virtual Environment Activation**:\n   - Ensure your virtual environment is activated in PyCharm, as this often affects the availability of environment variables.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue of the missing `SECRET_KEY` when running manage.py tasks in PyCharm. Make sure to restart PyCharm if you've made changes to configurations or environment variables for them to take effect."
