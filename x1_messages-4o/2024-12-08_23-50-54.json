        "content": "Certainly! To calculate the total revenue generated by a vending machine, you need two main pieces of information: the inventory with item prices and the sales data showing how many of each item were sold. Here's a sample Python code that demonstrates how to calculate the total revenue:\n\n```python\n# Sample inventory data: item names and their prices\ninventory = {\n    'Soda': 1.50,\n    'Chips': 1.00,\n    'Candy': 0.75,\n    'Water': 1.25,\n    'Juice': 1.75\n}\n\n# Sample sales data: number of each item sold\nsales_data = {\n    'Soda': 120,\n    'Chips': 150,\n    'Candy': 200,\n    'Water': 90,\n    'Juice': 60\n}\n\ndef calculate_total_revenue(inventory, sales_data):\n    total_revenue = 0\n    for item, quantity_sold in sales_data.items():\n        price = inventory.get(item, 0)  # Get the price of the item, default to 0 if not found\n        total_revenue += price * quantity_sold\n    return total_revenue\n\n# Calculate and print the total revenue\ntotal_revenue = calculate_total_revenue(inventory, sales_data)\nprint(f\"Total revenue generated by the vending machine: ${total_revenue:.2f}\")\n```\n\nThis code defines a dictionary for both the inventory and sales data. The `calculate_total_revenue` function iterates over the sales data, retrieves the corresponding price from the inventory, and accumulates the total revenue. Finally, it prints out the total revenue generated by the vending machine.\n\nMake sure to replace the sample data with your actual inventory and sales data to get accurate results."
