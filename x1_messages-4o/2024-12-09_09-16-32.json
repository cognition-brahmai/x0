        "content": "To construct an algorithm that counts the total number of occurrences of a specific substring within a given string, you can follow these steps. Here's a simple approach using Python as an example:\n\n```python\ndef count_substring_occurrences(main_string, substring):\n    count = 0\n    start = 0\n\n    while start < len(main_string):\n        # Find the substring starting from the current position\n        pos = main_string.find(substring, start)\n\n        # If the substring is found, increment the count and update the start position\n        if pos != -1:\n            count += 1\n            start = pos + 1\n        else:\n            break\n\n    return count\n\n# Example usage\nmain_string = \"hello world, hello universe, hello!\"\nsubstring = \"hello\"\noccurrences = count_substring_occurrences(main_string, substring)\nprint(f\"The substring '{substring}' occurs {occurrences} times in the main string.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialize Variables:**\n   - `count`: This keeps track of the number of times the substring is found.\n   - `start`: This keeps track of the current position in the main string from where the search should begin.\n\n2. **Loop Through the String:**\n   - Use a `while` loop to iterate through the main string.\n\n3. **Finding Substring:**\n   - Use the `find()` method to search for the substring starting from the current `start` position.\n   - If the substring is found, `find()` returns the index of the first occurrence; if not, it returns `-1`.\n\n4. **Update Count and Position:**\n   - If the substring is found (`pos != -1`), increment the `count` and update `start` to `pos + 1` to continue searching from the next position.\n\n5. **Break the Loop:**\n   - If the substring is not found (`pos == -1`), break out of the loop.\n\n6. **Return the Count:**\n   - Once the loop ends, return the total count of occurrences.\n\nThis method will correctly count overlapping occurrences as well, because the `start` position is updated to `pos + 1` after each find."
