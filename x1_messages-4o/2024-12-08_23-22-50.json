        "content": "To solve this problem, let's follow the steps one by one:\n\n### Step 1: Convert the decimal number 12707 to binary\n\n1. Divide the number by 2 and write down the remainder.\n2. Continue dividing the quotient by 2 until you reach 0.\n3. The binary representation is obtained by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n**12707 in binary:**\n```\n12707 / 2 = 6353 remainder 1\n6353 / 2 = 3176 remainder 1\n3176 / 2 = 1588 remainder 0\n1588 / 2 = 794 remainder 0\n794 / 2 = 397 remainder 0\n397 / 2 = 198 remainder 1\n198 / 2 = 99 remainder 0\n99 / 2 = 49 remainder 1\n49 / 2 = 24 remainder 1\n24 / 2 = 12 remainder 0\n12 / 2 = 6 remainder 0\n6 / 2 = 3 remainder 0\n3 / 2 = 1 remainder 1\n1 / 2 = 0 remainder 1\n```\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get: **11000110010011**\n\n### Step 2: Represent 12707 in 16-bit binary notation\n\nAdd leading zeros to make it a 16-bit number:\n```\n0011 0001 1001 0011\n```\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the two's complement of the binary number\n\n1. Invert all the bits (change 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s).\n2. Add 1 to the least significant bit (LSB).\n\n**Invert the bits:**\n```\n1100 1110 0110 1100\n```\n\n**Add 1 to the LSB:**\n```\n1100 1110 0110 1100\n+                     1\n--------------------\n1100 1110 0110 1101\n```\n\n### Step 4: Convert the two's complement binary back to decimal\n\nConvert `1100 1110 0110 1101` to decimal:\n\n- The leftmost bit is 1, indicating it's negative in two's complement.\n- Invert the bits: `0011 0001 1001 0010`\n- Add 1 to the LSB: `0011 0001 1001 0011` (which is 12707, as calculated before)\n\nThus, the decimal value is `-12707`.\n\n### Step 5: Convert the decimal value -12707 to octal\n\n1. Convert the magnitude (12707) to octal.\n2. Apply the negative sign.\n\n**12707 in octal:**\n```\n12707 / 8 = 1588 remainder 3\n1588 / 8 = 198 remainder 4\n198 / 8 = 24 remainder 6\n24 / 8 = 3 remainder 0\n3 / 8 = 0 remainder 3\n```\n\nReading from bottom to top, we get: **30643**\n\nThus, the octal representation of -12707 is `-30643`.\n\n### Step 6: Present the conversion process in a table\n\n| Conversion Step            | Value                   |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Decimal to Binary (16-bit) | 0011 0001 1001 0011     |\n| Two's Complement           | 1100 1110 0110 1101     |\n| Two's Complement to Decimal| -12707                  |\n| Decimal to Octal           | -30643                  |\n\nThis table presents the entire conversion process from 12707 in decimal to binary, then to its two's complement, and finally to octal."
