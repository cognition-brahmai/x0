However, I've noticed that my program only prints prime numbers up to 251 and then it stops. Can anyone explain why this is happening? Here is the code I've been using:\n\n```python\nfor numberToCheck in range(2,10000):\n    divider = 2\n    while numberToCheck > divider:\n        if numberToCheck % divider is 0:\n            break\n        else:\n            divider += 1\n    if numberToCheck is divider:\n        print(numberToCheck, \"is a prime number.\")\n```"
    },

        "content": "The issue with your code lies in the use of the `is` operator instead of `==` for comparison. In Python, `is` is used to check if two variables point to the same object in memory, whereas `==` is used to check if the values of the variables are equal. For integers, especially small ones, `is` might work due to Python's internal optimization called interning, but it fails for larger numbers.\n\nHere is the corrected version of your code using `==` for comparison:\n\n```python\nfor numberToCheck in range(2, 10000):\n    divider = 2\n    while numberToCheck > divider:\n        if numberToCheck % divider == 0:  # Change 'is' to '=='\n            break\n        else:\n            divider += 1\n    if numberToCheck == divider:  # Change 'is' to '=='\n        print(numberToCheck, \"is a prime number.\")\n```\n\nAdditionally, for efficiency, you might want to consider checking divisors only up to the square root of `numberToCheck`, as any non-prime number will have at least one divisor less than or equal to its square root. Here's an optimized version:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nfor numberToCheck in range(2, 10000):\n    is_prime = True\n    for divider in range(2, int(math.sqrt(numberToCheck)) + 1):\n        if numberToCheck % divider == 0:\n            is_prime = False\n            break\n    if is_prime:\n        print(numberToCheck, \"is a prime number.\")\n```\n\nThis version should be more efficient and work correctly for the entire range up to 10,000."
