Since we can't dynamically access or check against that database with a regular expression, we can only construct a regex pattern to match the format you specified.\n\nHere's a basic regex pattern that matches phone numbers in the format of (XXX)XXX-XXXX:\n\n```regex\n\\(\\d{3}\\)\\d{3}-\\d{4}\n```\n\nThis pattern breaks down as follows:\n- `\\(`: Matches the opening parenthesis.\n- `\\d{3}`: Matches exactly three digits.\n- `\\)`: Matches the closing parenthesis.\n- `\\d{3}`: Matches exactly three digits.\n- `-`: Matches the hyphen.\n- `\\d{4}`: Matches exactly four digits.\n\nTo actually exclude numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry, you would need additional logic in your application to compare matched numbers against a list or database of do-not-call numbers, which is beyond the capability of regular expressions alone."
