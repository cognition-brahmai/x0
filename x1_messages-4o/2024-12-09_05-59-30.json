The script works fine on my local machine (OSX 10.10) with Firefox v59, Selenium 3.11 and geckodriver v0.20. However, when I run the same script on my server (Ubuntu 16.04 32-bit, with the same versions of Python, Selenium and geckodriver), it randomly crashes the headless browser. The error messages say, \"Failed to decode response from marionette\" and \"Tried to run command without establishing a connection\". How can I solve this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing could be caused by several factors, especially given the differences between your local machine and the server environment. Here are a few steps and considerations to help you diagnose and potentially resolve the problem:\n\n1. **Update Components**: Ensure all components are fully updated:\n   - Check if there are newer versions of Firefox, Selenium, and geckodriver available and compatible with your setup. Sometimes updates can resolve bugs and improve compatibility.\n   \n2. **32-bit Compatibility**: Since your server is running a 32-bit version of Ubuntu, ensure that all components (Firefox, geckodriver) are fully compatible with 32-bit systems. If a discrepancy exists, it might lead to unexpected crashes.\n\n3. **Resource Limitations**: A headless browser can be resource-intensive. Make sure your server has enough CPU and memory resources available. Monitor resource usage while running the script to identify potential bottlenecks.\n\n4. **Marionette Settings**: The error \"Failed to decode response from marionette\" suggests a possible issue with communication between Selenium and the Firefox browser:\n   - Try adding a delay between actions to see if timing is an issue.\n   - You might want to try with a different version of Firefox or geckodriver to see if the issue persists.\n\n5. **Logging and Debugging**: Enable detailed logging for both Selenium and geckodriver to get more insights into what might be going wrong:\n   - For Selenium, you can add `service_log_path` to your WebDriver setup to capture logs.\n   - For geckodriver, run it with the `--log trace` flag to capture detailed logs.\n\n6. **Headless Mode**: If the problem persists, try running the browser without headless mode temporarily to see if additional error messages or behavior can be observed.\n\n7. **Environment Differences**: Check for other differences in the environment:\n   - Ensure all necessary libraries and dependencies on Ubuntu are installed and up-to-date.\n   - Consider testing on a different server environment or using a Docker container to replicate your local environment more closely.\n\n8. **Network Stability**: Ensure that your server has a stable network connection, as intermittent connectivity issues could also cause such errors.\n\n9. **Alternative Browsers**: As a last resort, consider testing with a different browser (e.g., Chrome with chromedriver) to see if the issue is specific to Firefox/geckodriver.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, you may need to provide more detailed logs or explore community forums for similar issues others may have encountered with your specific setup."
