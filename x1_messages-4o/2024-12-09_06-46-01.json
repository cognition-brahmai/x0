        "content": "How can I calculate a partial Area Under the Curve (AUC) in scikit learn, specifically for the part of the curve where the false positive rate is less than 0.1? I am currently able to compute the AUC for a binary classifier using `roc_auc_score( Y, clf.predict_proba(X)[:,1] )`. The scikit learn docs show how to use `roc_curve` but it doesn't seem to give the tpr value at fpr = 0.1, which is the only problem I'm facing. Is there a simple way to get the partial AUC?"

        "content": "To calculate the partial Area Under the Curve (AUC) for a specific range of the false positive rate (FPR) using scikit-learn, you need to manually compute the area for the section of the ROC curve you are interested in. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Compute the ROC Curve:**\n   Use the `roc_curve` function to get the true positive rate (TPR), false positive rate (FPR), and thresholds.\n\n2. **Select the Relevant Section:**\n   Identify and select the portion of the curve where the FPR is less than 0.1.\n\n3. **Calculate the Partial AUC:**\n   Use the trapezoidal rule to calculate the area under the selected part of the curve.\n\nHere's a step-by-step Python code snippet to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, auc\n\n# Assume Y_true are the true labels and Y_scores are the predicted probabilities\nfpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(Y, clf.predict_proba(X)[:, 1])\n\n# Select the part of the curve with FPR < 0.1\nmax_fpr = 0.1\nmask = fpr <= max_fpr\nfpr_partial = fpr[mask]\ntpr_partial = tpr[mask]\n\n# Compute partial AUC using the trapezoidal rule\npartial_auc = auc(fpr_partial, tpr_partial)\n\nprint(\"Partial AUC for FPR < 0.1:\", partial_auc)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`roc_curve`**: This function computes the FPR and TPR at various threshold levels.\n- **Masking the FPR**: We create a mask to select only those FPR values that are less than 0.1.\n- **Calculating Partial AUC**: We use the `auc` function from scikit-learn, which internally uses the trapezoidal rule, to calculate the area under the selected portion of the ROC curve.\n\nThis method allows you to compute the partial AUC for any desired range of FPR, giving you flexibility in evaluating the performance of your classifier in the specific scenario that you are interested in."
