How can I resolve this issue?\n\n```python\nfrom addressbook_pb2 import Person\n\np = Person()\np.email = \"abc\"\n\nprint p.email\n```\n\nHere is the error message I receive when I run the program:\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Applications/PyCharm CE.app/Contents/helpers/pydev/pydevd.py\", line 1531, in <module>\n    globals = debugger.run(setup['file'], None, None, is_module)\n  File \"/Applications/PyCharm CE.app/Contents/helpers/pydev/pydevd.py\", line 938, in run\n    pydev_imports.execfile(file, globals, locals)  # execute the script\n  File \"/Users/foo/personal/featureExtraction/protobuf_test.py\", line 1, in <module>\n    from addressbook_pb2 import Person\n  File \"/Applications/PyCharm CE.app/Contents/helpers/pydev/_pydev_bundle/pydev_monkey_qt.py\", line 71, in patched_import\n    return original_import(name, *args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/Users/foo/personal/featureExtraction/addressbook_pb2.py\", line 6, in <module>\n    from google.protobuf import descriptor as _descriptor\n  File \"/Applications/PyCharm CE.app/Contents/helpers/pydev/_pydev_bundle/pydev_monkey_qt.py\", line 71, in patched_import\n    return original_import(name, *args, **kwargs)\nImportError: No module named google.protobuf\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that the `google.protobuf` module is not being found by your Python environment, even though you've installed it. Here are a few steps to help you resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify Installation**:\n   Ensure that `protobuf` is indeed installed in the correct Python environment. You can verify it by running:\n   ```bash\n   pip show protobuf\n   ```\n   This should display information about the `protobuf` installation, including its location.\n\n2. **Check Python Environment**:\n   Make sure you are using the correct Python environment. If you've installed `protobuf` in a different environment, it won't be available in your current one. You can check which Python you're using by running:\n   ```bash\n   which python\n   ```\n   Or within Python:\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   print(sys.executable)\n   ```\n\n3. **Reinstall Protobuf**:\n   Sometimes, a reinstallation can resolve the issue. Try uninstalling and reinstalling the `protobuf` package:\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall protobuf\n   pip install protobuf\n   ```\n\n4. **PYTHONPATH**:\n   Ensure your PYTHONPATH includes the directory where `protobuf` is installed. You can temporarily modify it in your terminal:\n   ```bash\n   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/protobuf\n   ```\n   Replace `/path/to/protobuf` with the actual path where `protobuf` is installed.\n\n5. **Check for Multiple Python Installations**:\n   If you have multiple Python versions installed, ensure you're installing `protobuf` in the correct version. You might need to use `pip2` specifically for Python 2.7:\n   ```bash\n   pip2 install protobuf\n   ```\n\n6. **Verify `addressbook_pb2.py`**:\n   Make sure that `addressbook_pb2.py` is correctly generated and doesn't have any issues itself. It's often created using the `protoc` compiler, so ensure it's up-to-date and correctly referenced.\n\n7. **Use Virtual Environment**:\n   If the problem persists, consider using a virtual environment to manage your dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   virtualenv venv\n   source venv/bin/activate\n   pip install protobuf\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `ImportError` and get your script running correctly. If the issue persists, please provide additional details, and we can troubleshoot further."
