While the `math` module does provide constants for `pi` and `e`, it doesn't have a predefined value for the golden ratio. \n\nHowever, you can easily define the golden ratio in your code as it is a well-known mathematical constant. The golden ratio, often denoted as phi (\u03d5), is approximately 1.618033988749895. You can calculate it using the formula:\n\n\\[ \\phi = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\]\n\nHere's how you can define it in Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nphi = (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2\nprint(phi)\n```\n\nThis will give you the value of the golden ratio to a high degree of precision."
