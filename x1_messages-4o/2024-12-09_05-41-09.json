I attempted to use the `insert` method as `X = X.insert(X, 0)`, but I am not sure if this is the correct way to do it as it does not seem to work. Can you guide me on how to correctly prepend an element to a numpy array?"

In this case, you want to insert the element `[6.]` at the beginning (index `0`) of the array `X`.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nX = np.array([[5.], [4.], [3.], [2.], [1.]])\nX = np.insert(X, 0, [6.], axis=0)\n\nprint(X)\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n\n```\n[[6.]\n [5.]\n [4.]\n [3.]\n [2.]\n [1.]]\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `X` is the original array.\n- `0` is the index where you want to insert the new value.\n- `[6.]` is the value you want to insert.\n- `axis=0` specifies that the insertion should happen along the rows (i.e., prepend to the array)."
