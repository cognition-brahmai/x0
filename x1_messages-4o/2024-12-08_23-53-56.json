        "content": "To expand your existing Excel table with additional idioms and definitions using C#, you can utilize the `EPPlus` library, which allows you to work with Excel files easily. Here's how you can modify your code to ensure it's correctly adding new idioms and definitions, including one related to the performing arts:\n\n1. Make sure you have installed the `EPPlus` library in your project. You can do this via NuGet Package Manager by running:\n   ```\n   Install-Package EPPlus\n   ```\n\n2. Use the following C# code to open your Excel file, add new idioms and definitions, and save the updated file:\n\n```csharp\nusing OfficeOpenXml;\nusing System.IO;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        string filePath = @\"C:\\Path\\To\\Idioms.xlsx\";\n\n        // Load the Excel file\n        using (var package = new ExcelPackage(new FileInfo(filePath)))\n        {\n            // Get the first worksheet in the workbook\n            ExcelWorksheet worksheet = package.Workbook.Worksheets[\"Sheet1\"];\n            \n            // Find the next available row\n            int nextRow = worksheet.Dimension.End.Row + 1;\n\n            // Add new idioms and definitions\n            worksheet.Cells[nextRow, 1].Value = \"New Idiom\";\n            worksheet.Cells[nextRow, 2].Value = \"New Definition\";\n\n            // Add the performing arts idiom and definition\n            nextRow++;\n            worksheet.Cells[nextRow, 1].Value = \"Performing Arts Idiom\";\n            worksheet.Cells[nextRow, 2].Value = \"Definition of Performing Arts Idiom\";\n\n            // Save changes to the Excel file\n            package.Save();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Reference to EPPlus**: Make sure to include the `OfficeOpenXml` namespace to use EPPlus functionalities.\n- **Finding the Next Available Row**: The code calculates `nextRow` by getting the last used row in the worksheet and adding 1.\n- **Adding New Rows**: It then adds new idioms and definitions in the subsequent rows.\n- **Saving Changes**: Finally, it saves the changes to the Excel file.\n\n### Important Notes:\n- **EPPlus License**: Starting from version 5, EPPlus is licensed under LGPL, which means you need to comply with its terms or obtain a commercial license if required.\n- **File Path**: Ensure the file path is correct and that the program has permission to read/write the file.\n- **Excel Worksheet Name**: Ensure the worksheet name (\"Sheet1\") matches the one in your Excel file.\n\nBy following the above steps and code, you should be able to expand your Excel table with new idioms and definitions, including the one related to performing arts."
