I find methods such as those in tkinter to be overkill. Is there a Python package that can return the x-y position when the mouse is clicked?"

        "content": "Certainly! If you're looking for a simple way to get the x-y position of the mouse on a single left click in Python, you can use the `pynput` library, which provides a straightforward approach for handling mouse events. Here's a quick guide on how to achieve this:\n\nFirst, you'll need to install the `pynput` library if you haven't already. You can do this using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install pynput\n```\n\nThen, you can use the following script to capture the mouse click position:\n\n```python\nfrom pynput import mouse\n\ndef on_click(x, y, button, pressed):\n    if pressed and button == mouse.Button.left:\n        print(f\"Mouse clicked at ({x}, {y})\")\n        # Stop listener\n        return False\n\n# Set up the listener\nwith mouse.Listener(on_click=on_click) as listener:\n    listener.join()\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The `mouse.Listener` listens for mouse events.\n- The `on_click` function is called whenever a mouse button is clicked. It checks if the left button was pressed and, if so, prints the x-y coordinates.\n- The `return False` statement stops the listener after the first click, which is useful if you only want to capture the position once.\n\nThis script is simple and should meet your needs without the overhead of more complex GUI frameworks like `tkinter`."
