Here's a simple example of how you can identify the part of speech for the word \"abstract\" in the given sentence:\n\n```python\nimport nltk\n\n# Download necessary NLTK data files (only need to run this once)\nnltk.download('punkt')\nnltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')\n\n# Sentence to analyze\nsentence = \"The abstract concept is difficult to define.\"\n\n# Tokenize the sentence into words\nwords = nltk.word_tokenize(sentence)\n\n# Perform part-of-speech tagging\npos_tags = nltk.pos_tag(words)\n\n# Print the part of speech for each word\nfor word, tag in pos_tags:\n    print(f\"{word}: {tag}\")\n\n# Find the part of speech for the word 'abstract'\nabstract_pos = [tag for word, tag in pos_tags if word.lower() == 'abstract']\nif abstract_pos:\n    print(f\"\\nThe part of speech for the word 'abstract' is: {abstract_pos[0]}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The word 'abstract' was not found in the sentence.\")\n```\n\nThis code will tokenize the sentence, perform part-of-speech tagging, and print the part of speech for each word. The part of speech for \"abstract\" in this context should be tagged as an adjective (JJ)."
