When I check the shape of 'features.values', it returns as (10000,) instead of the expected (10000, 3000). How can I get this to be recognized as a 2D array rather than a 1D array with arrays as values? Why doesn't it automatically detect it as a 2D array?\n\nCode:\n```\nfeatures.values = array([array([0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 0, 0]), array([0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 0, 0]),\n       array([0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 0, 0]), ...,\n       array([0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 0, 0]), array([0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 0, 0]),\n       array([0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 0, 0])], dtype=object)\n\nfeatures.values.shape = (10000,)\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is because `features.values` is being interpreted as a 1D array of objects (each being a separate numpy array) rather than a 2D numpy array. This typically happens when the arrays inside the series have been stored as objects, possibly due to differences in their lengths or because they are nested arrays.\n\nTo convert this into a 2D numpy array, assuming each array inside the series has the same length (3000 in your case), you can use `np.stack` or `np.vstack` to combine these arrays along a new axis. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Assuming 'features' is your pandas series\narrays = features.values  # This will be a 1D array of arrays\n\n# Use np.stack or np.vstack to convert into a 2D array\ntwo_d_array = np.stack(arrays)\n\n# Alternatively, you can also use np.vstack\n# two_d_array = np.vstack(arrays)\n\nprint(two_d_array.shape)  # This should now be (10000, 3000)\n```\n\n### Why It Doesn't Automatically Detect as a 2D Array:\n\n1. **Object dtype**: When the series is converted to a numpy array, it uses `dtype=object` because it contains objects (in this case, arrays of potentially varying lengths or structures). Numpy doesn't automatically convert this to a 2D array because it treats each element as an independent object.\n\n2. **Uniformity Requirement**: For numpy to interpret a collection as a multi-dimensional array, the inner arrays need to be of the same size or shape. If they are not, numpy will fall back to treating them as objects.\n\nBy explicitly using `np.stack` or `np.vstack`, you are indicating that you want these arrays to be combined into a 2D structure, assuming they are all of the same shape. If there are indeed discrepancies in the shapes of the inner arrays, you'll need to address those before stacking."
