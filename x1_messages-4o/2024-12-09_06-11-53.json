Currently, I'm using the following code to import csv files into a pandas dataframes, convert to pandas datetime, and set to index, but it takes a lot of time and I would like to see a progress bar.\n\n```python\n#Import csv files into a Pandas dataframes and convert to Pandas datetime and set to index\n\neurusd_ask = pd.read_csv('EURUSD_Candlestick_5_m_ASK_01.01.2012-05.08.2017.csv')\neurusd_ask.index = pd.to_datetime(eurusd_ask.pop('Gmt time'))\n```"

        "content": "Yes, you can use the TQDM library to show a progress bar when working with large datasets in Pandas. Since TQDM is designed to work with iterables, you can use it in conjunction with Pandas' `read_csv` and other operations by iterating over rows or chunks of the data if necessary. Here's how you can incorporate TQDM into your process:\n\nFirst, make sure you have TQDM installed. If not, you can install it via pip:\n\n```bash\npip install tqdm\n```\n\nThen, you can modify your code to use TQDM as follows:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\n\n# Read the CSV in chunks (you can adjust chunk size as needed)\nchunk_size = 10000  # Adjust this based on your system's memory capacity\nchunks = pd.read_csv('EURUSD_Candlestick_5_m_ASK_01.01.2012-05.08.2017.csv', chunksize=chunk_size)\n\n# Initialize an empty DataFrame to concatenate chunks later\neurusd_ask = pd.DataFrame()\n\n# Iterate over the chunks with a progress bar\nfor chunk in tqdm(chunks, desc='Processing CSV'):\n    chunk['Gmt time'] = pd.to_datetime(chunk['Gmt time'])  # Convert to datetime\n    eurusd_ask = pd.concat([eurusd_ask, chunk], ignore_index=True)\n\n# Set the datetime column as index\neurusd_ask.set_index('Gmt time', inplace=True)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Chunking**: Reading the CSV in chunks allows you to process large files without consuming too much memory at once. The `chunksize` parameter sets the number of rows per chunk.\n\n2. **TQDM with Iterables**: By iterating over the chunks with `tqdm`, you can show a progress bar that updates as each chunk is processed.\n\n3. **Datetime Conversion**: The conversion to datetime is applied within the loop to each chunk.\n\n4. **Concatenation**: Each processed chunk is concatenated to a DataFrame, building the full dataset over iterations.\n\nThis approach is particularly useful for very large datasets that might not fit into memory if read all at once. Adjust the `chunk_size` based on your system's capacity and the size of your CSV files."
