In the following script, I assign the list `[1,2]` to variable `a` and then assign `a` to `b`. After appending `3` to `a`, both `a` and `b` print as `[1,2,3]`. However, I expected `b` to remain as `[1,2]` even after modifying `a`. Why does `b` also get changed when I only modify `a`? Is `b` permanently tied to `a`? If so, how can I make them independent?\n\n```python\na = [1,2]\nb = a\na.append(3)\nprint a\n#>>> [1,2,3]\nprint b\n#>>> [1,2,3]\n```"

        "content": "In Python, when you assign a list (or any mutable object) to a new variable, you are not creating a new independent copy of the list. Instead, both variables refer to the same object in memory. This is why when you modify `a`, `b` also reflects the changes, because both `a` and `b` are pointing to the same list.\n\nIf you want `b` to remain as `[1, 2]` and independent of `a`, you need to create a copy of the list. You can do this in a couple of ways:\n\n1. **Using the `list()` constructor:**\n\n   ```python\n   a = [1, 2]\n   b = list(a)\n   a.append(3)\n   print a  # [1, 2, 3]\n   print b  # [1, 2]\n   ```\n\n2. **Using list slicing:**\n\n   ```python\n   a = [1, 2]\n   b = a[:]\n   a.append(3)\n   print a  # [1, 2, 3]\n   print b  # [1, 2]\n   ```\n\n3. **Using the `copy` module (available in Python 2.6):**\n\n   ```python\n   import copy\n\n   a = [1, 2]\n   b = copy.copy(a)\n   a.append(3)\n   print a  # [1, 2, 3]\n   print b  # [1, 2]\n   ```\n\nThese methods will ensure that `b` is a separate list with its own distinct copy of the original elements from `a`."
