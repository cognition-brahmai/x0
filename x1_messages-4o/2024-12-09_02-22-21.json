I have a dictionary like this:\n```python\nsteps = {1:\"value1\", 5:\"value2\", 2:\"value3\"}\n```\nI attempted to sort it using the following code, but I found that the values were missing in the resulting list:\n```python\nx = sorted(steps, key=lambda key: steps[key])\n```"

Then you can access the values using these sorted keys. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nsteps = {1: \"value1\", 5: \"value2\", 2: \"value3\"}\n\n# Sort the dictionary by keys and iterate over it\nfor key in sorted(steps):\n    print(f\"Key: {key}, Value: {steps[key]}\")\n```\n\nIn this code, `sorted(steps)` sorts the keys of the dictionary, and then you can use these sorted keys to access the corresponding values. This will print the keys and values in the order of their sorted keys."
