I am able to figure out whether an object is a directory or a file as shown below:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndirList = os.listdir(\"./\") # current directory\nfor dir in dirList:\n  if os.path.isdir(dir) == True:\n    # I don't know how to get into this dir and do the same thing here\n  else:\n    # I got file and i can regexp if it is .htm|html\n```\nHowever, I am not sure how to proceed from here. I want to have all the files and their paths in an array. Is there a way to accomplish this in Python?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this by using Python's `os` module to recursively walk through the directories and find files with `.htm` or `.html` extensions. Here's a sample code snippet that does exactly what you're looking for:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef find_html_files(root_dir):\n    html_files = []\n\n    # Use os.walk to traverse the directory tree\n    for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk(root_dir):\n        for file in filenames:\n            # Check if the file ends with .htm or .html\n            if file.endswith(('.htm', '.html')):\n                # Append the full path of the file to the list\n                html_files.append(os.path.join(dirpath, file))\n    \n    return html_files\n\n# Use the function to find all HTML files starting from the current directory\nhtml_files_list = find_html_files(\"./\")\n\n# Print the list of HTML files\nfor html_file in html_files_list:\n    print(html_file)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`os.walk(root_dir)`**: This function generates the file names in a directory tree by walking the tree either top-down or bottom-up. For each directory in the tree rooted at `root_dir`, it yields a 3-tuple `(dirpath, dirnames, filenames)`.\n  - `dirpath`: The path to the directory.\n  - `dirnames`: A list of the names of the subdirectories in `dirpath`.\n  - `filenames`: A list of the names of the non-directory files in `dirpath`.\n- **`file.endswith(('.htm', '.html'))`**: This checks if a file ends with the specified extensions.\n- **`os.path.join(dirpath, file)`**: This constructs the full path of the file.\n\nThis code will give you a list of all HTML files in the current directory and its subdirectories. Feel free to modify the `root_dir` parameter to point to a different directory if needed."
