However, when I dump the model file, I am getting multiple files as follows: ['clf.pkl', 'clf.pkl_01.npy', 'clf.pkl_02.npy', 'clf.pkl_03.npy', 'clf.pkl_04.npy', 'clf.pkl_05.npy', 'clf.pkl_06.npy', 'clf.pkl_07.npy', 'clf.pkl_08.npy', 'clf.pkl_09.npy', 'clf.pkl_10.npy', 'clf.pkl_11.npy']. Why are there multiple files and what are the *.npy files? Is this normal or am I doing something wrong? Here is the code I used:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn import svm\nfrom sklearn import datasets\nfrom sklearn.externals import joblib\n\nclf = svm.SVC()\niris = datasets.load_iris()\nX, y = iris.data, iris.target\nclf.fit(X, y)\n\nprint(clf.predict(X))\njoblib.dump(clf, 'clf.pkl') \n```"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is related to how `joblib` handles serialization of large numpy arrays. In your case, the SVM model likely contains large arrays, such as the support vectors, which are causing `joblib` to split the serialized data into multiple files. This is a normal behavior when using `joblib` with large objects.\n\nHere's a quick explanation of what's happening:\n\n1. **Main File (`clf.pkl`)**: This is the main file that contains the serialized object structure.\n2. **Numpy Files (`clf.pkl_01.npy`, etc.)**: These files store the large numpy arrays separately. `joblib` does this to optimize the serialization and deserialization speed and to avoid memory issues with large arrays.\n\nThis behavior is controlled by the `numpy` module within `joblib`, which defaults to splitting arrays larger than a certain size into separate files.\n\nIf you want to store everything in a single file, you can use the `pickle` module instead of `joblib`, but keep in mind that `joblib` is more efficient for large numpy arrays. Here\u2019s how you can do it with `pickle`, although it may not be as efficient for large data:\n\n```python\nimport pickle\n\nwith open('clf.pkl', 'wb') as file:\n    pickle.dump(clf, file)\n```\n\nHowever, using `joblib` is generally recommended for models from `scikit-learn` due to its efficiency in handling large numpy objects. If you prefer to keep using `joblib` and are okay with the multiple files, this is perfectly normal and there's nothing wrong with your process. When you load the model with `joblib.load('clf.pkl')`, it will correctly interpret all the separate files and reconstruct the model."
