However, the company's database is a mess and contains a lot of irrelevant information.\nTo start, you must filter out any products that have been marked as out of stock or returned. Next, you must group the remaining products by their category and calculate the total revenue generated by each category over the past year.\nOnce you have this data, you must identify the top 10 bestselling products within each category and retrieve the name, price, and author/publisher of each product. Finally, you must display the total revenue generated by these products, grouped by month and year.\nTo accomplish this, you will need to use a combination of SQL queries and data analysis techniques. Good luck!"

Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on how to approach this using SQL and data analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Filter Out Irrelevant Data\n\nFirst, ensure that you only consider products that are in stock and have not been returned. You can achieve this with an SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM sales_data\nWHERE in_stock = TRUE AND returned = FALSE;\n```\n\n### Step 2: Group by Category and Calculate Total Revenue\n\nNext, group the products by their category and calculate the total revenue for each category:\n\n```sql\nSELECT category, SUM(price * quantity_sold) AS total_revenue\nFROM sales_data\nWHERE in_stock = TRUE AND returned = FALSE\nGROUP BY category;\n```\n\n### Step 3: Identify Top 10 Bestselling Products within Each Category\n\nFor each category, you'll need to find the top 10 bestselling products based on the total revenue. This can be done by first calculating the revenue per product and then using a window function to rank them:\n\n```sql\nWITH CategoryRevenue AS (\n    SELECT product_id, category, name, price, author_publisher, \n           SUM(price * quantity_sold) AS product_revenue\n    FROM sales_data\n    WHERE in_stock = TRUE AND returned = FALSE\n    GROUP BY product_id, category, name, price, author_publisher\n),\nRankedProducts AS (\n    SELECT *, \n           RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY product_revenue DESC) AS rank\n    FROM CategoryRevenue\n)\nSELECT product_id, name, price, author_publisher, product_revenue\nFROM RankedProducts\nWHERE rank <= 10;\n```\n\n### Step 4: Display Total Revenue by Month and Year\n\nFinally, calculate and display the total revenue generated by the top products, grouped by month and year:\n\n```sql\nWITH FilteredSales AS (\n    SELECT *\n    FROM sales_data\n    WHERE in_stock = TRUE AND returned = FALSE\n),\nMonthlyRevenue AS (\n    SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', sale_date) AS month_year, \n           SUM(price * quantity_sold) AS monthly_revenue\n    FROM FilteredSales\n    GROUP BY month_year\n)\nSELECT month_year, monthly_revenue\nFROM MonthlyRevenue\nORDER BY month_year;\n```\n\n### Notes:\n- Ensure your database schema matches the column names used in these queries (e.g., `sales_data`, `in_stock`, `returned`, `price`, `quantity_sold`, `category`, `name`, `author_publisher`, `sale_date`).\n- The performance of these queries can be improved by ensuring that appropriate indexes are in place on columns used for filtering and grouping.\n- Consider using a data analysis tool like Python (Pandas library) or R for additional data visualization or reporting once the data is extracted.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to extract the necessary insights from the messy sales data. Good luck!"
