        "content": "In a `MANIFEST.in` file, which is used to specify additional files to include in a Python package distribution built with setuptools or distutils, the `graft` command is used to include an entire directory and all its contents in the distribution.\n\nWhen you see a line like `graft tools` in a `MANIFEST.in` file, it means that the entire `tools` directory, along with all of its subdirectories and files, should be included in the package distribution. This is useful for ensuring that non-Python files or additional resources, such as data files, scripts, or documentation, are bundled with the package when it's distributed.\n\nHere's a quick example to illustrate how `graft` works:\n\nSuppose you have the following project structure:\n\n```\nmy_project/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 setup.py\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 MANIFEST.in\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 tools/\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 script.sh\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 config.yaml\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 helpers/\n    \u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 helper.py\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 my_package/\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n```\n\nWith a `MANIFEST.in` file containing:\n\n```\ngraft tools\n```\n\nWhen you build the distribution package using a command like `python setup.py sdist`, the `tools` directory and all its contents (`script.sh`, `config.yaml`, and everything inside `helpers/`) will be included in the source distribution package.\n\nThis ensures that any scripts, configuration files, and additional resources you need for your package are included when others install or download your package."
