Copy the code into a Java IDE or a text editor and save it as `FlightBooking.java`.\n2. Compile the program using the Java compiler with the command `javac FlightBooking.java`.\n3. Run the compiled program using the command `java FlightBooking`.\n4. Enter the flight number (either `1` or `2`) when prompted.\n5. Enter the number of tickets you want to purchase when prompted.\n6. The program will display the flight details and the total cost of the booking."
