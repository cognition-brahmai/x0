        "content": "To center text in merged cells using `openpyxl`, you need to apply the `Alignment` class from `openpyxl.styles` to the cell. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. Import the necessary classes.\n2. Merge the cells.\n3. Apply the `Alignment` with `horizontal='center'` and `vertical='center'` to the desired cell.\n\nHere's an example of how to do it:\n\n```python\nfrom openpyxl import Workbook\nfrom openpyxl.styles import Alignment\n\n# Create a workbook and select the active worksheet\nwb = Workbook()\nws = wb.active\n\n# Merge cells A1 and B1\nws.merge_cells('A1:B1')\n\n# Set the value of the merged cell\nws['A1'] = \"Centered Text\"\n\n# Align the text to the center of the merged cells\ncenter_alignment = Alignment(horizontal='center', vertical='center')\nws['A1'].alignment = center_alignment\n\n# Save the workbook if needed\nwb.save('example.xlsx')\n```\n\nMake sure to use the `Alignment` class and set the `horizontal` and `vertical` attributes to `'center'`. This will properly center the text in the merged cells `A1:B1`."
