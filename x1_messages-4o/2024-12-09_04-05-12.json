Specifically, I have a list of strings representing timestamps in the format \"HH:mm\", for example, `timestamps = [\"22:58\", \"03:11\", \"12:21\"]`. I want to convert this list into a list of integers representing the number of minutes since midnight for each timestamp, like `converted = [22*60+58, 3*60+11, 12*60+21]`. My initial attempt at achieving this using a single list comprehension, `return [int(hh) * 60 + int(mm) for ts in timestamps for hh, mm = ts.split(\":\")]`, is syntactically incorrect. I am currently using `return [int(ts.split(\":\")[0]) * 60 + int(ts.split(\":\")[1]) for ts in timestamps]` as a solution, but I believe it's inefficient because it splits the string twice. How can I achieve this in a more efficient manner?"

        "content": "To efficiently convert your list of timestamp strings into a list of integers representing the number of minutes since midnight, you can use a single list comprehension while ensuring each timestamp is split only once. You can achieve this by unpacking the result of the `split()` method directly within the list comprehension. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ntimestamps = [\"22:58\", \"03:11\", \"12:21\"]\nconverted = [int(hh) * 60 + int(mm) for ts in timestamps for hh, mm in [ts.split(\":\")]]\n```\n\nIn this code, `ts.split(\":\")` is executed once for each timestamp, and the result is unpacked into `hh` and `mm` in the list comprehension. This avoids calling `split()` multiple times for the same string and achieves the desired conversion efficiently."
