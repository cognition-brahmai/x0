Then, based on the given prompt, what is the maximum number of people that could have attended the event? Furthermore, if some people were so inspired by the event that they donated again, what formula could you use to calculate the total amount raised if you only have the average donation amount and the number of attendees who donated once?"

        "content": "To solve these problems, let's break them down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Maximum Number of People Attending the Event**:\n   If the total donation amount must be at least $5000, and assuming each person donates at least $1, the maximum number of people who could have attended and donated would be 5000 people (each donating exactly $1). This is a theoretical maximum under the assumption that everyone donates the minimum possible amount to reach the required total. In practice, the number could be fewer since people might donate more than $1 each.\n\n2. **Formula for Calculating Total Amount Raised**:\n   If you know the average donation amount and the number of attendees who donated once, the total amount raised can be calculated using the formula:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Amount Raised} = (\\text{Average Donation Amount} \\times \\text{Number of Attendees}) + \\text{Additional Donations}\n   \\]\n\n   Here, the \"Additional Donations\" term accounts for any extra contributions made by attendees who were inspired to donate again. If you don't have information on additional donations, you would just use:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Amount Raised} = \\text{Average Donation Amount} \\times \\text{Number of Attendees}\n   \\]\n\nThis approach ensures that you can calculate the total donation amount based on the information available to you."
