        "content": "The `__peg_parser__` keyword you encountered is actually a special, undocumented keyword that was introduced as part of the transition to the new PEG parser in Python. Starting with Python 3.9, the CPython team began adopting a new parsing technique known as PEG (Parsing Expression Grammar) to replace the previous LL(1) parser. This transition was aimed at enhancing the language's ability to support new syntax in a more flexible way.\n\nThe `__peg_parser__` keyword was included in the keyword list as a part of this transition, but it was never intended for use in regular Python code. It is more of an internal placeholder or marker used by the development team during the integration and testing of the PEG parser. The error message \"You found it!\" is a kind of Easter egg for those who stumble upon it, indicating that it's not meant for general use and serves no functional purpose for end-users of Python.\n\nIn summary, you are receiving this error because `__peg_parser__` is not a real keyword meant for use in Python code. It was temporarily part of the keyword list for internal testing and development purposes related to the new parser implementation. You can safely ignore it and continue using the rest of Python's functionalities without concern."
