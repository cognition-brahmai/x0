        "content": "I am trying out TensorFlow v2 beta and the tf.keras models. When I compile a model and select the optimizer as the string 'adam', the model trains properly. However, when I use the default optimizer tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(), it doesn't train and outputs a 'nan' loss at each iteration. I thought the string 'adam' is supposed to be the default Adam optimizer. I've tried several hyperparameters (learning_rate, beta_1, beta_2, etc.), but none seem to work. Can anyone explain why this is happening?\n\nCode when 'adam' string is used:\n```python\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')\nmodel.fit(x, y)\n```\nCode when tf.keras.optimizers.Adam() is used:\n```python\nadam = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()\nmodel.compile(optimizer=adam, loss='categorical_crossentropy')\nmodel.fit(x, y)\n```"

        "content": "When you encounter a situation where using the string 'adam' works, but using `tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()` results in `nan` losses, there are a few potential reasons and solutions to consider:\n\n1. **Default Hyperparameters**: While 'adam' and `tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()` should theoretically be equivalent with default parameters, subtle differences might exist due to changes in defaults between versions or specific configurations. Double-check the default values of parameters like `learning_rate`, `beta_1`, `beta_2`, and `epsilon` to ensure they align.\n\n2. **Numerical Stability**: The `epsilon` parameter in Adam is crucial for numerical stability. If it's too small, it might lead to `nan` values, especially in cases with small gradients. Try increasing `epsilon` slightly:\n   ```python\n   adam = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(epsilon=1e-7)\n   ```\n\n3. **Data Issues**: Sometimes `nan` losses are caused by data issues, such as NaNs or infinities in your dataset. Ensure your input data `x` and labels `y` are properly preprocessed and free from such anomalies.\n\n4. **Initial Learning Rate**: The default learning rate might be too high for your specific data, leading to divergence. You can try lowering it:\n   ```python\n   adam = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=1e-4)\n   ```\n\n5. **Gradient Clipping**: If the gradients are exploding, you can try gradient clipping:\n   ```python\n   adam = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(clipnorm=1.0)\n   ```\n\n6. **TensorFlow Version**: Ensure that your TensorFlow version is up-to-date, as there might be bug fixes related to optimizer behavior. Sometimes, beta versions have bugs that are resolved in stable releases.\n\n7. **Custom Training Loop**: If none of the above solutions work, consider using a custom training loop to gain more control and insight into the training process. This may help identify where exactly the `nan` values are originating.\n\nBy systematically checking these aspects, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue causing the `nan` losses when using `tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()`."
