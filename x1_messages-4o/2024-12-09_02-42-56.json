The Key values are unique in both table A and table B, however, in some cases a Key will occur in both tables. In R, I am familiar with using a filtering join (anti-join) to get values in table B that do not occur in table A and then appending the two tables. The R code I am using is as follows:\n\n```R\nlibrary(\"dplyr\")\n\n## Filtering join to remove values already in \"TableA\" from \"TableB\"\nFilteredTableB <- anti_join(TableB,TableA, by = \"Key\")\n\n## Append \"FilteredTableB\" to \"TableA\"\nCombinedTable <- bind_rows(TableA,FilteredTableB)\n```\n\nHow can I achieve the same in Python?"

        "content": "In Python, you can achieve similar functionality using the `pandas` library, which provides powerful data manipulation capabilities similar to `dplyr` in R. Here's how you can perform the equivalent operation using `pandas`:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample data for TableA and TableB\ndata_a = {'Key': [1, 2, 3], 'ValueA': ['A1', 'A2', 'A3']}\ndata_b = {'Key': [3, 4, 5], 'ValueB': ['B3', 'B4', 'B5']}\n\n# Create DataFrames\ntable_a = pd.DataFrame(data_a)\ntable_b = pd.DataFrame(data_b)\n\n# Perform an anti-join to filter TableB\nfiltered_table_b = table_b[~table_b['Key'].isin(table_a['Key'])]\n\n# Combine the filtered TableB with TableA\ncombined_table = pd.concat([table_a, filtered_table_b], ignore_index=True)\n\nprint(combined_table)\n```\n\nThis code performs the following steps:\n\n1. Creates two sample DataFrames, `table_a` and `table_b`, to represent your tables A and B.\n2. Uses the `isin` method within a negation (`~`) to filter out rows in `table_b` where the 'Key' exists in `table_a`.\n3. Uses `pd.concat` to append the filtered `table_b` to `table_a`, effectively combining the tables with the desired logic.\n\nMake sure you have the `pandas` library installed in your Python environment. You can install it using `pip`:\n\n```bash\npip install pandas\n```\n\nThis approach should provide the same result as your R code, retaining all data from `table_a` and adding only unique keys from `table_b`."
