I am trying to filter this table by the 'due_date' to get all rows after a specific date, or all rows within a particular month. However, I am unable to do so. Here's the structure of my table:\n\n```\npayment_to, amount, due_date (a DateTime object)\n\ncompany A, 3000, 7-20-2018\ncompany B, 3000, 7-21-2018\ncompany C, 3000, 8-20-2018\n```\n\nAnd this is my payment db model:\n\n```\nclass Payment(db.Model, UserMixin):\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, unique = True, primary_key = True)\n\n    payment_to = db.Column(db.String, nullable = False)\n    amount = db.Column(db.Float, nullable = False)\n\n    due_date = db.Column(db.DateTime, nullable = False, default = datetime.strftime(datetime.today(), \"%b %d %Y\"))\n    week_of = db.Column(db.String, nullable = False)\n```\n\nI have tried filtering the 'Payment' by date using this code:\n\n```\nPayment.query.filter(Payment.due_date.month == today.month, Payment.due_date.year == today.year, Payment.due_date.day >= today.day).all()\n```\n\nWhere 'today' is simply `datetime.today()`. However, this doesn't seem to work. What would be the best way to filter the 'Payment' columns by date?"

        "content": "To filter your `Payment` records by date using SQLAlchemy, you'll need to handle the `due_date` filtering slightly differently. The expression you're using to filter by date doesn't work because SQLAlchemy doesn't directly support accessing the attributes of a `DateTime` object like `month` and `year` in the query. Instead, you should use the `extract` function to perform these operations.\n\nHere's how you can filter the `Payment` records to get all rows after a specific date and all rows within a particular month:\n\n1. **Filter by a specific date:**\n\n   If you want to get payments with a `due_date` after a specific date:\n\n   ```python\n   from datetime import datetime\n\n   specific_date = datetime(2018, 7, 21)\n   payments_after_date = Payment.query.filter(Payment.due_date > specific_date).all()\n   ```\n\n2. **Filter by a specific month and year:**\n\n   To get all payments within a particular month and year, use the `extract` function:\n\n   ```python\n   from sqlalchemy import extract\n\n   specific_month = 7  # July\n   specific_year = 2018\n   payments_in_month = Payment.query.filter(\n       extract('month', Payment.due_date) == specific_month,\n       extract('year', Payment.due_date) == specific_year\n   ).all()\n   ```\n\n3. **Filter for the current month:**\n\n   If you want to filter for the current month (based on today's date), you can do:\n\n   ```python\n   today = datetime.today()\n   current_month_payments = Payment.query.filter(\n       extract('month', Payment.due_date) == today.month,\n       extract('year', Payment.due_date) == today.year\n   ).all()\n   ```\n\nThese filters should allow you to retrieve the desired records from your database using the `due_date` column. Make sure you have imported the necessary modules, such as `datetime` and `extract`, from SQLAlchemy and Python's standard library."
