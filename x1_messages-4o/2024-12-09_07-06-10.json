        "content": "I am using a Pandas DataFrame to perform a row-wise t-test with \"a\" and \"b\" as one group, and \"c\" and \"d\" as the other group. I am using the `apply` method with `axis=1`. Normally, I would just output the p-value, but I would like to generate an additional value based on other calculations. I am looking for a way to return two values from the apply function. Here's an example of the calculation:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind\n\ndef t_test_and_mean(series, first, second):\n    first_group = series[first]\n    second_group = series[second]\n    _, pvalue = ttest_ind(first_group, second_group)\n\n    mean_ratio = second_group.mean() / first_group.mean()\n\n    return (pvalue, mean_ratio)\n\ndf.apply(t_test_and_mean, first=[\"a\", \"b\"], second=[\"c\", \"d\"], axis=1)\n```\n\nThe problem is, this returns a single Series with the two tuples as values. Instead, I would like the output to be a DataFrame with two columns, one for the first result, and one for the second. Is there a way to do this or do I have to perform two separate runs for the two calculations and then merge them together?"

        "content": "You can achieve this by modifying your function to return a Pandas Series instead of a tuple, which will allow the `apply` method to naturally form a DataFrame with separate columns for each value. Here's how you can adjust your code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind\n\ndef t_test_and_mean(series, first, second):\n    first_group = series[first]\n    second_group = series[second]\n    _, pvalue = ttest_ind(first_group, second_group)\n\n    mean_ratio = second_group.mean() / first_group.mean()\n\n    # Return a Pandas Series with named indices\n    return pd.Series({\"pvalue\": pvalue, \"mean_ratio\": mean_ratio})\n\n# Example DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    \"a\": [1, 2, 3],\n    \"b\": [4, 5, 6],\n    \"c\": [7, 8, 9],\n    \"d\": [10, 11, 12]\n})\n\n# Apply the function row-wise\nresult = df.apply(t_test_and_mean, first=[\"a\", \"b\"], second=[\"c\", \"d\"], axis=1)\n\n# Display the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nIn this code, `t_test_and_mean` returns a Pandas Series with named indices \"pvalue\" and \"mean_ratio\". When `apply` is used with `axis=1`, it collects these Series into a DataFrame with columns corresponding to the named indices. This way, you get a DataFrame with separate columns for the p-values and mean ratios without the need for separate calculations or merging."
