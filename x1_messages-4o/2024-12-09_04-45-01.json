However, about 5 minutes into the process, I get a 'Killed' message with no further explanation, and the process stops. I am querying a database during this process, so I suspect it could be a disk space issue or an Out Of Memory (OOM) issue. I am having trouble finding logs about this kill message to understand the root cause of this problem. Can anyone guide me on where to find these logs? \n\nHere is the output I get:\n\n```bash\nroot@c7b800e0f276:/opt/mymodule# python\nPython 2.7.13 (default, May  1 2017, 22:44:36)\n[GCC 4.9.2] on linux2\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> from mymodule import model\n>>> model.run('2017-04-01')\nINFO:Deleting from input table.\nINFO:Inserting into input table.\nINFO:Querying input table for chunk.\nKilled\nroot@c7b800e0f276:/opt/mymodule# exit\n```"

        "content": "The 'Killed' message you're encountering is typically a sign that your process was terminated by the operating system, often due to resource constraints like running out of memory (OOM). When a system runs out of available memory, the Linux kernel's OOM killer will terminate processes to free up memory, starting with the most memory-intensive processes.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to help you diagnose and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Docker Resources:**\n   - Ensure that Docker has been allocated sufficient resources. On Mac, Docker runs inside a virtual machine. You can adjust the CPU and memory allocation via Docker Desktop settings:\n     - Go to Docker Desktop > Preferences > Resources.\n     - Increase the memory and CPU limits if they are too low.\n\n2. **Monitor Memory Usage:**\n   - You can use Docker stats to monitor your container's memory usage in real-time. Run `docker stats` in your terminal to see the resource usage of your running containers.\n\n3. **Check for OOM Events:**\n   - Inside the Docker VM, you can check for OOM events by looking at the system logs. Access the Docker machine using:\n     ```bash\n     docker-machine ssh\n     ```\n   - Once inside, check the system logs, particularly `dmesg` for OOM messages:\n     ```bash\n     dmesg | grep -i \"oom\"\n     ```\n   - Alternatively, you can check `/var/log/syslog` or `/var/log/messages` for information about the process being killed.\n\n4. **Optimize Your Code:**\n   - If your script is consuming a lot of memory, consider optimizing your code to use less memory. For example, process data in smaller chunks, use generators, or optimize data structures.\n\n5. **Increase Swap Space:**\n   - If increasing memory allocation isn't feasible, consider increasing the swap space to allow the system to handle temporary spikes in memory usage. You can do this by modifying the Docker VM's configuration.\n\n6. **Review Docker Logs:**\n   - Check the logs of your Docker container to see if they provide any additional clues. You can use the `docker logs <container_id>` command to view the logs.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify whether the issue is indeed related to memory constraints and take appropriate actions to resolve it. If the logs confirm an OOM event, adjusting the Docker resource allocation or optimizing your code should help mitigate the problem."
