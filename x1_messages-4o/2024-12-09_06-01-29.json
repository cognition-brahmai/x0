Even though the path with the username can be resolved unambiguously, I still have to use os.path.expanduser on every path my code deals with. Here is my example:\n\n```python\nPython 2.7.2 (default, Oct 13 2011, 15:27:47) \n[GCC 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-44)] on linux2\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> from os.path import isdir,expanduser\n>>> isdir(\"~amosa/pdb\")\nFalse\n>>> isdir(expanduser(\"~amosa/pdb\"))\nTrue\n>>>\n>>> from os import chdir\n>>> chdir(\"~amosa/pdb\")\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nOSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '~amosa/pdb'\n>>> chdir(expanduser(\"~amosa/pdb\"))\n>>>\n```\nThis behavior seems to be inconsistent with the concept of \"duck typing\" in which I expect python not to whine unless there's actually a problem."

        "content": "The behavior you're encountering is due to how Python handles path expansions in its standard library. The tilde (`~`) is used in Unix-like operating systems as a shorthand for a user's home directory. However, this is a shell-specific feature, meaning it's the shell (like bash or zsh) that interprets the `~` and translates it to the actual path of the user's home directory, not the underlying operating system.\n\nIn Python, when you provide a path that includes `~`, the standard library functions like `os.path.isdir()` or `os.chdir()` do not automatically expand this shorthand to the actual path. This is because Python, unlike a shell, doesn't inherently know what `~` should expand to. Instead, it treats it as a literal part of the path string.\n\nThis is where `os.path.expanduser()` comes into play. It explicitly translates the `~` to the current user's home directory, or to a specific user's home directory if you provide a path like `~username`. This function is necessary to convert the shorthand into a path that Python's file system functions can understand and work with.\n\nRegarding duck typing, Python does embrace this concept, which means it relies on the object's behavior rather than its type. However, this principle doesn't extend to interpreting shell-specific syntax like `~`. The need to explicitly expand the user path is more about handling strings and file paths correctly than about type-related behavior.\n\nIn summary, whenever you deal with paths that might include `~`, you'll need to use `os.path.expanduser()` to ensure those paths are correctly interpreted by Python's file system functions. This ensures that your code is portable and doesn't rely on shell behavior that Python isn't aware of by default."
