I am curious about how the default `__hash__` function works for custom objects and whether it can be relied upon. For instance, I have observed that mutable objects are explicitly unhashable as `hash({})` raises an error. However, custom classes seem to be hashable as shown in the following code:\n\n```python\nclass Object(object): pass\no = Object()\nhash(o)\n```\nCan I depend on this default hash if I use objects of the same type as keys in a dictionary? For example:\n```python\nkey1 = MyObject()\nkey2 = MyObject()\nkey3 = MyObject()\n{key1: 1, key2: 'blabla', key3: 456}\n```\nAlso, can I rely on it if I use objects of different types as keys in a dictionary? For instance:\n```python\n{int: 123, MyObject(10): 'bla', 'plo': 890}\n```\nLastly, how can I ensure that my custom hashes don't conflict with the built-in hashes? For example:\n```python\n{int: 123, MyObject(10): 'bla', MyObjectWithCustomHash(123): 890}\n```"

        "content": "In Python, the `__hash__` method is used to generate a hash value for an object, which allows it to be used as a key in a dictionary or an element in a set. Here's a breakdown of how default and custom hash methods work, and how you can manage them effectively:\n\n### Default `__hash__` Method\n\n1. **Default Hashing for Custom Objects:**\n   - By default, instances of custom classes in Python are hashable. The default `__hash__` implementation in a user-defined class relies on the object's `id`, which is unique for that instance during its lifetime. This means different instances of the same class will have different hash values unless explicitly overridden.\n\n2. **Using Objects as Keys:**\n   - In your example with `key1`, `key2`, and `key3`, since each is a different instance of `MyObject`, each will have a unique hash value. Thus, they can coexist as keys in the same dictionary without conflict.\n\n3. **Objects of Different Types:**\n   - When you use objects of different types as keys (e.g., `int`, `MyObject`, `str`), the default hashing mechanism works fine as each type generally has its own `__hash__` implementation. Built-in types like `int`, `str`, and others have their own hash functions, which are designed to minimize collisions.\n\n### Custom `__hash__` Method\n\n1. **Implementing a Custom `__hash__`:**\n   - If your objects have attributes and you want their hash value to depend on these attributes, you should define a custom `__hash__` method in your class. Ensure that the attributes used in `__hash__` are immutable, as changes would lead to unpredictable behavior in hash-based collections.\n\n2. **Avoiding Conflicts:**\n   - When creating a custom hash method, ensure that it produces a wide range of values to minimize potential collisions. Here's a simple template for a custom `__hash__` method:\n     ```python\n     class MyObject:\n         def __init__(self, attr1, attr2):\n             self.attr1 = attr1\n             self.attr2 = attr2\n         \n         def __hash__(self):\n             return hash((self.attr1, self.attr2))\n     ```\n   - This uses a tuple of the attributes, which is hashed to produce a single hash value. This method takes advantage of Python's built-in ability to hash tuples.\n\n3. **Ensuring Consistency:**\n   - When overriding `__hash__`, it is often useful to also override `__eq__` to ensure that objects considered equal have the same hash value. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of hash-based collections like dictionaries and sets:\n     ```python\n     class MyObject:\n         def __init__(self, attr1, attr2):\n             self.attr1 = attr1\n             self.attr2 = attr2\n         \n         def __hash__(self):\n             return hash((self.attr1, self.attr2))\n         \n         def __eq__(self, other):\n             if isinstance(other, MyObject):\n                 return (self.attr1, self.attr2) == (other.attr1, other.attr2)\n             return False\n     ```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe default `__hash__` method can be relied upon for using object instances as dictionary keys, provided they are different instances. However, if you have specific attributes that define the identity of your objects, implementing a custom `__hash__` is a good practice. Ensure that any attributes used for hashing are immutable and that you implement `__eq__` to maintain consistency between equality and hash values. This approach ensures your custom hash values don't conflict with any built-in hashes."
