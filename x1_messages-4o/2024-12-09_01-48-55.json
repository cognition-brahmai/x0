The error message I receive is \"Buffer has wrong number of dimensions (expected 1, got 2)\". I previously executed a similar merge using only two columns, which worked fine. The code I am using is as follows:\n\n```python\ndf = pd.merge(df, c, how=\"left\",\n        left_on=[\"section_term_ps_id\", \"section_school_id\", \"state\"],\n        right_on=[\"term_ps_id\", \"term_school_id\", \"state\"])\n```\n\nThe columns for the two dataframes, df and c, are:\n\ndf:\n\n```python\nIndex([u'section_ps_id', u'section_school_id', u'section_course_number', u'section_term_ps_id', u'section_staff_ps_id', u'section_number', u'section_expression', u'section_grade_level', u'state', u'sections_id', u'course_ps_id', u'course_school_id', u'course_number', u'course_schd_dept', u'courses_id', u'school_ps_id', u'course_school_id', u'school_name', u'school_abbr', u'school_low_grade', u'school_high_grade', u'school_alt_school_number', u'school_state', u'school_phone', u'school_fax', u'school_principal', u'school_principal_phone', u'school_principal_email', u'school_asst_principal', u'school_asst_principal_phone', u'school_asst_principal_email'], dtype='object')\n```\n\nc:\n\n```python\nIndex([u'term_ps_id', u'term_school_id', u'term_portion', u'term_start_date', u' term_end_date', u'term_abbreviation', u'term_name', u'state', u'terms_id', u'sch ool_ps_id', u'term_school_id', u'school_name', u'school_abbr', u'school_low_grade', u'school_high_grade', u'school_alt_school_number', u'school_state', u'school_phone', u'school_fax', u'school_principal', u'school_principal_phone', u'school_principal_email', u'school_asst_principal', u'school_asst_principal_phone', u'school_asst_principal_email'], dtype='object')\n```\n\nIs it possible to merge on three columns like this?

        "content": "Yes, it's definitely possible to merge on three columns using `pandas.merge()` in Python. The error message \"Buffer has wrong number of dimensions (expected 1, got 2)\" is a bit unusual for a merge operation and might indicate a different underlying issue. Here's a checklist to help troubleshoot and resolve the problem:\n\n1. **Check Column Existence**: Ensure that all columns specified in `left_on` and `right_on` actually exist in their respective DataFrames. From your description, it looks like they should, but it's worth double-checking.\n\n    ```python\n    print(df.columns)\n    print(c.columns)\n    ```\n\n2. **Check Column Data Types**: Ensure that the columns you're merging on have compatible data types. For example, if `section_term_ps_id` in `df` is of type `int64`, then `term_ps_id` in `c` should also be `int64`. You can check data types using:\n\n    ```python\n    print(df.dtypes)\n    print(c.dtypes)\n    ```\n\n3. **Handle Duplicate Column Names**: Make sure there are no duplicate column names within each DataFrame that might cause confusion. In your DataFrame `c`, it seems there are two `term_school_id` columns. Ensure that each column has a unique name.\n\n4. **Check for NaN Values**: Examine if there are any NaN values in the columns you're using for the merge. NaNs can sometimes cause unexpected behavior in merges.\n\n5. **Inspect Data Values**: Look at the actual data in the columns to ensure there are no unexpected characters or data issues that might be causing problems.\n\n6. **Simplify DataFrames**: As a troubleshooting step, try creating smaller DataFrames with only the relevant columns and perform the merge to see if the error persists:\n\n    ```python\n    df_reduced = df[['section_term_ps_id', 'section_school_id', 'state']]\n    c_reduced = c[['term_ps_id', 'term_school_id', 'state']]\n\n    merged = pd.merge(df_reduced, c_reduced, how=\"left\",\n                      left_on=[\"section_term_ps_id\", \"section_school_id\", \"state\"],\n                      right_on=[\"term_ps_id\", \"term_school_id\", \"state\"])\n    ```\n\n7. **Update Pandas**: Ensure that you are using a relatively recent version of pandas. Sometimes, bugs are fixed in newer versions, so updating pandas might resolve the issue.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to pinpoint the issue and resolve the error you're encountering. If the problem persists after these checks, consider sharing a sample of your data to better diagnose the issue."
