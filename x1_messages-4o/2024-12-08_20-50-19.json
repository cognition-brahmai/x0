First, perform the multiplication and division from left to right:\n   - \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\)\n   - \\(5 \\div 6 \\approx 0.8333\\)\n\n2. Now, substitute these values back into the expression:\n   - \\(2 + 12 - 0.8333\\)\n\n3. Finally, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n   - \\(2 + 12 = 14\\)\n   - \\(14 - 0.8333 \\approx 13.1667\\)\n\nSo, the result of the expression is approximately \\(13.1667\\)."
