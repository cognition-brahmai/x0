        "content": "To detect the Python version being used at runtime, you can utilize the `sys` module, which provides access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter. Specifically, you can use `sys.version_info`, which gives you a tuple containing the major, minor, micro, release level, and serial version information. Here's a simple way to check the Python version and take different actions based on whether you're running Python 2.x or Python 3.x:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Get the Python version as a tuple\nversion_info = sys.version_info\n\n# Print the full version details\nprint(\"Full version info:\", version_info)\n\n# Check if the major version is less than 3\nif version_info[0] < 3:\n    print(\"Running on Python 2.x\")\n    # You can handle Python 2.x specific code here\nelse:\n    print(\"Running on Python 3.x\")\n    # You can handle Python 3.x specific code here\n\n# Alternatively, you can also use:\n# if sys.version_info < (3, 0):\n#     print(\"Running on Python 2.x\")\n# else:\n#     print(\"Running on Python 3.x\")\n```\n\nThis code will print out whether the script is running under Python 2 or Python 3, and you can add specific logic for each version as needed. The `sys.version_info` tuple is useful because you can compare it directly to determine if the Python version meets certain criteria, such as being less than or greater than a specific version."
