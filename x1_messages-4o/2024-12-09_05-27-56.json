However, I noticed that contrary to Macport, there seems to be no python_select utility and my default mac python continues to remain the default. When I run `which python`, it returns `/usr/bin/python`, which is not a symlink. How can I make python installed by brew my default python?"

        "content": "To make the Python installed by Homebrew your default Python on macOS, you'll need to adjust your shell's PATH environment variable. When you install Python via Homebrew, it places the Python binaries in a directory that is typically something like `/usr/local/Cellar/python@2.7/<version>/bin`. However, the symlink to the Python executable will be placed in `/usr/local/bin`, which is where you should point your PATH.\n\nHere\u2019s how to update your shell configuration to use the Homebrew version of Python by default:\n\n1. **Open Terminal**:\n   Start by opening Terminal on your Mac.\n\n2. **Find the Homebrew Python Path**:\n   Run the command `brew --prefix python` to confirm the Homebrew path, typically it should point you to something like `/usr/local`.\n\n3. **Update Your PATH**:\n   You'll need to edit your shell configuration file to include the Homebrew binary directory at the start of your PATH. Depending on the shell you are using, you will edit either `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, or another relevant file.\n\n   For bash:\n   ```bash\n   echo 'export PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bash_profile\n   source ~/.bash_profile\n   ```\n\n   For zsh:\n   ```zsh\n   echo 'export PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.zshrc\n   source ~/.zshrc\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify the Change**:\n   After updating your PATH, verify that the Homebrew Python is now the default by running:\n   ```bash\n   which python\n   ```\n\n   This should now return `/usr/local/bin/python`.\n\n5. **Check the Python Version**:\n   Confirm that the correct version of Python is being used by running:\n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   ```\n\nThis process ensures that the Homebrew version of Python is prioritized over the system default Python. By placing `/usr/local/bin` at the beginning of your PATH, you ensure that when you execute `python`, it refers to the Homebrew-installed version."
