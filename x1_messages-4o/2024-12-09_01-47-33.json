I am trying to write some serialization and copy methods for a couple of models, but I can't just iterate over the `obj.__dict__` because it contains SQLAlchemy-specific items. Is there a way to extract only the `id` and `desc` names from the model?\n\nFor example, consider the following model:\n\n```python\nclass JobStatus(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'jobstatus'\n\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n    desc = Column(Unicode(20))\n```\n\nIn this case, I could easily create a function like this:\n\n```python\ndef logme(self):\n    return {'id': self.id, 'desc': self.desc}\n```\n\nBut I would prefer a solution that auto-generates the dictionary, especially when dealing with larger objects."

        "content": "To iterate over the list of columns defined in a SQLAlchemy model and automatically generate a dictionary containing just the column names and their values, you can make use of the `__table__` attribute of the model which provides metadata about the table, including columns. Here's how you can implement such a function:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy.inspection import inspect\n\nclass JobStatus(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'jobstatus'\n\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n    desc = Column(Unicode(20))\n\n    def logme(self):\n        return {column.name: getattr(self, column.name) for column in self.__table__.columns}\n\n# Alternatively, using the SQLAlchemy inspection system\n    def logme_inspect(self):\n        return {column.key: getattr(self, column.key) for column in inspect(self).mapper.column_attrs}\n\n# Usage\njob_status = JobStatus(id=1, desc='Completed')\nprint(job_status.logme())          # {'id': 1, 'desc': 'Completed'}\nprint(job_status.logme_inspect())  # {'id': 1, 'desc': 'Completed'}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`self.__table__.columns`**: This provides an iterable of the columns defined in the SQLAlchemy model, allowing you to access each column's name and retrieve its value from the instance using `getattr`.\n- **`inspect(self).mapper.column_attrs`**: This utilizes SQLAlchemy's inspection system to access column attributes. It is a more abstract approach and works well if you're dealing with more complex models where you might have additional attributes or relationships.\n\nBoth methods will help you dynamically generate a dictionary of column names and values, which is particularly useful for serialization or logging purposes."
