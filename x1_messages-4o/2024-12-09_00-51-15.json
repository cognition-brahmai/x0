Open the original file and read the first line.\n2. Modify the first line as needed.\n3. Write the modified first line to a new file.\n4. Append the rest of the lines from the original file to the new file without modifying them.\n\nHere's a Python script that demonstrates this process:\n\n```python\n# Define the filenames\noriginal_file = 'large_file.txt'\nnew_file = 'modified_file.txt'\n\n# Open the original file and the new file\nwith open(original_file, 'r') as infile, open(new_file, 'w') as outfile:\n    # Read the first line from the original file\n    first_line = infile.readline()\n\n    # Modify the first line as needed\n    modified_first_line = first_line.upper()  # Example modification: convert to uppercase\n\n    # Write the modified first line to the new file\n    outfile.write(modified_first_line)\n\n    # Copy the rest of the lines from the original file to the new file\n    for line in infile:\n        outfile.write(line)\n```\n\nThis script will efficiently handle the task by only modifying the first line and then appending the rest of the lines from the original file to the new one. This approach avoids reading the entire file into memory, making it suitable for handling large files."
