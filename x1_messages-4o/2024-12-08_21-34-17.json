Can you provide me with a code that iterates through all possible 4-digit numbers and checks if they are palindromic? If a number is palindromic, I would like to add it to a list of palindromic numbers and print out the list at the end of the program. Thank you in advance for your help!"

        "content": "Certainly! Below is a C# program that iterates through all 4-digit numbers, checks if they are palindromic, and adds them to a list. At the end of the program, it prints the list of palindromic numbers.\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\n\nclass PalindromicNumbers\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        List<int> palindromicNumbers = new List<int>();\n\n        // Iterate through all 4-digit numbers\n        for (int i = 1000; i <= 9999; i++)\n        {\n            if (IsPalindromic(i))\n            {\n                palindromicNumbers.Add(i);\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Print the list of palindromic numbers\n        Console.WriteLine(\"4-digit Palindromic Numbers:\");\n        foreach (int number in palindromicNumbers)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(number);\n        }\n    }\n\n    static bool IsPalindromic(int number)\n    {\n        string numStr = number.ToString();\n        char[] numArray = numStr.ToCharArray();\n        Array.Reverse(numArray);\n        string reversedStr = new string(numArray);\n\n        return numStr == reversedStr;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Iteration**: The program iterates through all numbers from 1000 to 9999, which are the 4-digit numbers.\n\n2. **Palindrome Check**: For each number, it converts the number to a string, reverses the string, and checks if the reversed string is equal to the original string. If they are equal, the number is palindromic.\n\n3. **Adding to List**: If the number is palindromic, it is added to the `palindromicNumbers` list.\n\n4. **Output**: After iterating through all 4-digit numbers, the program prints all the palindromic numbers stored in the list.\n\nYou can run this code in a C# environment to see the list of 4-digit palindromic numbers."
