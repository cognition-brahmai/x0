The impact varies for each material and depends on the energy and emissions saved per pound. Your task is to create a code that can handle multiple input variables and output the results for each material separately. This will require careful reasoning and analysis to provide a more accurate estimation of the overall impact of recycling on the environment. Are you up for the challenge?"

        "content": "Certainly! To solve this environmental puzzle using Ruby, we need to write a program that calculates the total environmental impact of recycling various materials. We'll need to consider the energy and emissions saved per pound for each material. Here's a sample Ruby script to help you get started:\n\n```ruby\n# Define a hash to store the energy and emissions savings for each material per pound\nMATERIAL_SAVINGS = {\n  aluminum: { energy_saved: 14.0, emissions_saved: 7.0 }, # Example values\n  glass: { energy_saved: 2.0, emissions_saved: 1.0 },\n  paper: { energy_saved: 5.0, emissions_saved: 3.0 },\n  plastic: { energy_saved: 3.0, emissions_saved: 2.0 }\n}\n\n# Method to calculate the total impact of recycling a given material\ndef calculate_impact(material, pounds)\n  if MATERIAL_SAVINGS.key?(material)\n    energy_saved = MATERIAL_SAVINGS[material][:energy_saved] * pounds\n    emissions_saved = MATERIAL_SAVINGS[material][:emissions_saved] * pounds\n    puts \"Recycling #{pounds} pounds of #{material} saves:\"\n    puts \"- Energy: #{energy_saved} units\"\n    puts \"- Emissions: #{emissions_saved} units\"\n  else\n    puts \"Material not recognized. Please choose from: #{MATERIAL_SAVINGS.keys.join(', ')}\"\n  end\nend\n\n# Example usage\nmaterials_to_recycle = {\n  aluminum: 10, # pounds\n  glass: 15,\n  paper: 25,\n  plastic: 8\n}\n\nmaterials_to_recycle.each do |material, pounds|\n  calculate_impact(material, pounds)\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Data Structure**: We use a hash `MATERIAL_SAVINGS` to store the energy and emissions savings per pound for each recyclable material. This allows easy access and modification of savings values.\n\n2. **Method Definition**: The `calculate_impact` method takes two parameters: `material` and `pounds`. It calculates the total energy and emissions saved by multiplying the savings per pound by the total pounds of material recycled.\n\n3. **Input and Output**: The script takes a hash `materials_to_recycle` where keys are material names and values are the pounds to be recycled. It then iterates over this hash, calling `calculate_impact` for each material to output the savings.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: If a material is not recognized, it outputs a message listing available options.\n\nFeel free to modify the savings values in the `MATERIAL_SAVINGS` hash to reflect more accurate data that you may have. This script is a starting point and can be expanded to include more materials or different units of measurement as needed."
