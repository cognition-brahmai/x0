Here's a breakdown of what each line does:\n\n1. `int a, b;` - This line declares two integer variables `a` and `b`.\n2. `a = 5;` - This line assigns the value `5` to the variable `a`.\n3. `b = a + 1;` - This line assigns to the variable `b` the result of the expression `a + 1`, which is `6` because `a` has been assigned the value `5`.\n\nIn summary, this code initializes `a` with the value `5` and then initializes `b` with a value that is one greater than `a`, resulting in `b` being `6`."
