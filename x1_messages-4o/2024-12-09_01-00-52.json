The widget functions as expected, allowing me to update, retrieve, and clear items. However, it does not support multiple selections in its current state. How can I enable multiple selection functionality for a QListWidget in PyQt? My initial understanding is that I might need to create a custom QListWidget through subclassing, but I am unsure of the steps to follow after that. I have found some solutions in C++, but I am specifically looking for a Python solution."

        "content": "To enable multiple selection functionality in a `QListWidget` in PyQt, you don't necessarily need to subclass `QListWidget`. Instead, you can modify the selection mode of the existing `QListWidget` instance. PyQt provides a simple way to set the selection mode to allow for multiple selections. You can do this by setting the `selectionMode` property of the `QListWidget` to `QAbstractItemView.MultiSelection`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QListWidget, QAbstractItemView, QVBoxLayout, QWidget\n\nclass MyWindow(QWidget):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n\n        self.initUI()\n\n    def initUI(self):\n        # Create a QListWidget\n        self.listWidget = QListWidget(self)\n\n        # Enable multiple selection\n        self.listWidget.setSelectionMode(QAbstractItemView.MultiSelection)\n\n        # Add some items to the QListWidget\n        for i in range(10):\n            self.listWidget.addItem(f\"Item {i}\")\n\n        # Set up a layout and add the QListWidget to the layout\n        layout = QVBoxLayout()\n        layout.addWidget(self.listWidget)\n        self.setLayout(layout)\n\n        # Set the window title\n        self.setWindowTitle('QListWidget Multi Selection Example')\n\n        # Set the window size\n        self.resize(300, 200)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    import sys\n    app = QApplication(sys.argv)\n    window = MyWindow()\n    window.show()\n    sys.exit(app.exec_())\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Import Required Modules:** Start by importing the necessary modules from PyQt5. You'll need `QApplication`, `QListWidget`, `QAbstractItemView`, `QWidget`, and others for laying out the widget.\n\n2. **Create a QListWidget Instance:** Within your main window or widget class, create an instance of `QListWidget`.\n\n3. **Set Selection Mode:** Use the `setSelectionMode` method on your `QListWidget` instance to set the selection mode to `QAbstractItemView.MultiSelection`. This allows users to select multiple items at once.\n\n4. **Add Items:** Populate your `QListWidget` with items as needed.\n\n5. **Layout:** Use a `QVBoxLayout` to arrange the `QListWidget` within your window or widget.\n\nThis approach should suffice for enabling multiple selection in your `QListWidget` without the need for subclassing."
