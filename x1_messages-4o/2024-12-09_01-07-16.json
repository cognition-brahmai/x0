However, you can access line numbers through a few alternative methods or workarounds:\n\n1. **Using an Extension**: There are third-party extensions and scripts available online that modify IDLE to show line numbers. These often require you to modify IDLE's source code or configuration files.\n\n2. **Alternative Editors**: Consider using an alternative Python editor or IDE that supports line numbers out of the box, such as PyCharm, VSCode, or Atom. These editors provide a more feature-rich environment for Python development, including line numbers.\n\n3. **IDLE Shell Workaround**: Although it doesn't provide line numbers, you can print the current line number in the shell by using a simple script. For example, you can use a function to display the current line of code being executed.\n\nFor most users, switching to an editor that supports line numbers natively is the most straightforward solution, especially for larger projects or when debugging extensively."
