I have my conda environment located at the default location for Windows, which is `C:\\ProgramData\\Anaconda2\\envs\\myenv`. I have made sure that conda scripts and executables are not within the `%PATH%` environment variable, as advised. When I point the Python interpreter in PyCharm to `C:\\ProgramData\\Anaconda2\\envs\\myenv\\python.exe`, all works fine in the python console, run environment, and debug mode. But, the terminal does not automatically activate the environment despite checking the box for activating the environment. I tried several methods including copying the activate script from anaconda folder to environment folder, copying it to the `Scripts` folder under the environment, using an activate script from the virtualenv, and adding the anaconda folders to the path. None of these methods seem to work. How can I automatically activate the conda environment when the terminal is opened in PyCharm?"

        "content": "When facing issues with automatically activating a conda environment in the PyCharm terminal, there are a few steps and configurations you can try to ensure the environment is activated correctly:\n\n1. **Check PyCharm Terminal Settings:**\n   - Go to `File > Settings` (or `PyCharm > Preferences` on macOS).\n   - Navigate to `Tools > Terminal`.\n   - Ensure the \"Activate virtualenv\" option is checked. This setting is supposed to activate your conda environment automatically in the terminal.\n\n2. **Update Conda Initialization:**\n   - Open an Anaconda Prompt (not a standard Command Prompt).\n   - Run the command `conda init` to ensure that the shell is properly initialized to use conda.\n   - You may need to restart your system after running this command.\n\n3. **Custom Shell Script:**\n   - Create a custom shell script to activate your environment whenever you open the terminal.\n   - In the `Settings > Tools > Terminal`, set the `Shell Path` to a script that includes the activation command. For example, create a `activate_env.bat` script with the content:\n     ```bat\n     @echo off\n     call C:\\ProgramData\\Anaconda2\\Scripts\\activate.bat C:\\ProgramData\\Anaconda2\\envs\\myenv\n     cmd.exe /K\n     ```\n   - Set the `Shell Path` in PyCharm to point to this script.\n\n4. **Ensure Conda is Properly Installed:**\n   - Make sure that your conda installation is not corrupted. You can try reinstalling Anaconda or Miniconda if problems persist.\n\n5. **Use Conda Environment as Interpreter:**\n   - Sometimes setting the conda environment as the project interpreter can solve the terminal activation issue. Go to `File > Settings > Project: <Project Name> > Python Interpreter`, and select the interpreter located in your conda environment.\n\n6. **Update PyCharm:**\n   - Make sure that you are using the latest version of PyCharm. Updates often contain bug fixes that might resolve your issue.\n\n7. **Check for PyCharm Plugin Conflicts:**\n   - Disable any third-party plugins that might interfere with the terminal or environment settings to see if the issue resolves.\n\nIf none of the above solutions work, you might need to manually activate the environment each time you open the terminal by typing `conda activate myenv`. This is a temporary workaround, but it ensures that your environment is activated correctly."
