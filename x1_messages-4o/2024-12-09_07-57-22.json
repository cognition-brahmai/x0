        "content": "Certainly! `reveal_type` is a built-in function in mypy, a static type checker for Python. It's used to display the type of a variable as inferred by mypy during type checking. You don't need to import it; it's directly available when you're running mypy.\n\nHere's how you can use `reveal_type`:\n\n1. **Install mypy**: If you haven't installed mypy yet, you can do so using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install mypy\n   ```\n\n2. **Write your Python code**: Use `reveal_type` within your code where you want to check the type. Here's an example:\n\n   ```python\n   def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n       result = a + b\n       reveal_type(result)  # This line will show the type of `result`\n       return result\n\n   x = add(2, 3)\n   reveal_type(x)  # This will show the type of `x`\n   ```\n\n3. **Run mypy on your file**: Execute mypy in the command line on your Python file:\n\n   ```bash\n   mypy your_file.py\n   ```\n\n   Replace `your_file.py` with the name of your Python file.\n\n4. **Interpreting the Output**: When you run mypy, it will output the types at the locations where you've used `reveal_type`. For the example above, you might see output like:\n\n   ```\n   your_file.py:3: note: Revealed type is 'builtins.int'\n   your_file.py:7: note: Revealed type is 'builtins.int'\n   ```\n\nThis output indicates that mypy has inferred the type of `result` and `x` to be `int`. You can use `reveal_type` anywhere in your code to check what mypy infers about a particular variable or expression. It's a useful tool for debugging and understanding type inference in complex type-checking scenarios."
