I can't understand why this is happening. Here is my code:\n\n```python\ncv = KFold(n_splits=10)\n\nfor train_index, test_index in cv.split(X):\n    f_train_X, f_valid_X = X[train_index], X[test_index]\n    f_train_y, f_valid_y = y[train_index], y[test_index]\n```\n\nI use `X` (a Pandas dataframe) to perform `cv.split(X)`. The shape of `X` and `y` are as follows:\n\n```python\nX.shape\n# Out: (13503, 17)\ny.shape\n# Out: (13503,)\n```\n\nWhy am I receiving this KeyError?"

        "content": "The KeyError you're encountering is due to how you're using the indices returned by the `KFold.split()` method with your Pandas DataFrame and Series. When you use `train_index` and `test_index` to index into `X` and `y`, you need to make sure that you're indexing correctly.\n\nThe indices returned by `KFold.split()` are NumPy arrays of integer positions, which means they should be used for positional indexing. However, when you try to use these indices directly on a Pandas DataFrame or Series, Pandas attempts to use them as labels, not as positional indices, leading to the KeyError.\n\nTo fix this, you should convert these indices to positional indices using `.iloc` for both `X` and `y`. Here's the corrected code:\n\n```python\ncv = KFold(n_splits=10)\n\nfor train_index, test_index in cv.split(X):\n    f_train_X, f_valid_X = X.iloc[train_index], X.iloc[test_index]\n    f_train_y, f_valid_y = y.iloc[train_index], y.iloc[test_index]\n```\n\nBy using `.iloc`, you ensure that you're using the indices as positional indices, which should resolve the KeyError you're experiencing."
