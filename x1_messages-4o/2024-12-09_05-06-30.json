I have been unsuccessful in my efforts to remove these dags. I have already set `load_examples = False` in the airflow.cfg file and removed the folder lib/python2.7/site-packages/airflow/example_dags. The states of these example dags change to gray after I removed the dags folder, but they are still visible on the web UI screen. I have also specified a new dag folder in the airflow.cfg file as `dags_folder = /mnt/dag/1`. Upon checking this dag folder, it is empty. Why is it so difficult to remove these examples?"

        "content": "It sounds like you've taken several steps to remove the example DAGs from Apache Airflow's UI, but there's still some persistence happening. Let's go through the steps again and identify any potential issues or additional steps you might need to take:\n\n1. **Set `load_examples = False`**: You\u2019ve already done this, which is the correct step to prevent future example DAGs from being loaded.\n\n2. **Remove Example DAGs from the Installation**:\n   - You already removed the example DAGs by deleting the `example_dags` directory. This should prevent them from being loaded in the future.\n\n3. **Clear Existing Example DAGs from the Database**:\n   - The example DAGs may still exist in your Airflow metadata database even after deleting the files. You\u2019ll need to remove them from the database. You can do this using the Airflow CLI:\n\n     ```bash\n     airflow dags list\n     ```\n\n     Find the DAG IDs of the example DAGs and then delete them:\n\n     ```bash\n     airflow dags delete <dag_id>\n     ```\n\n     Replace `<dag_id>` with the actual DAG ID of each example DAG.\n\n4. **Check the DagBag**:\n   - Make sure your `dags_folder` is correctly set and accessible. Since you've set `dags_folder = /mnt/dag/1` and it's empty, ensure there are no lingering symlinks or files in other directories that might be causing the example DAGs to appear.\n\n5. **Restart the Airflow Scheduler and Web Server**:\n   - After making these changes, restart the Airflow services to ensure the UI reflects the current state:\n     ```bash\n     airflow scheduler\n     airflow webserver\n     ```\n   - If you\u2019re using systemd or another service manager, use the appropriate command to restart the services.\n\n6. **Database Clean-Up**:\n   - If the above steps don't work, you might need to manually inspect and clean up the metadata database. This is more advanced and should be done with caution. You can connect to your database and look into tables like `dag`, `dag_run`, etc., to ensure there are no entries for the example DAGs.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to remove the example DAGs from the Airflow UI. If the problem persists, double-check your environment for any discrepancies or misconfigurations."
