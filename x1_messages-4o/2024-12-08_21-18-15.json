        "content": "To accomplish both tasks in Python, you'll need to create a program that prints \"Hello World\", uses a recursive function to generate numbers from 1 to 100, and then stores these numbers in a data structure that can be sorted and filtered. Here's a step-by-step guide and the corresponding code:\n\n### Step 1: Print \"Hello World\"\n\nFirst, you'll need to print \"Hello World\" using a simple print statement.\n\n```python\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n```\n\n### Step 2: Create a Recursive Function\n\nNext, create a recursive function to generate numbers from 1 to 100. The function will call itself until it reaches the base case.\n\n```python\ndef generate_numbers(n, max_n):\n    if n > max_n:\n        return []\n    return [n] + generate_numbers(n + 1, max_n)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Store Numbers in a List and Sort/Filter\n\nAfter generating the numbers, store them in a list. Use list comprehensions and Python array methods to sort and filter them by odd or even numbers.\n\n```python\n# Generate numbers from 1 to 100\nnumbers = generate_numbers(1, 100)\n\n# Sort numbers (though they're already sorted)\nsorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)\n\n# Filter even numbers\neven_numbers = [num for num in sorted_numbers if num % 2 == 0]\n\n# Filter odd numbers\nodd_numbers = [num for num in sorted_numbers if num % 2 != 0]\n\n# Printing the results\nprint(\"Sorted Numbers:\", sorted_numbers)\nprint(\"Even Numbers:\", even_numbers)\nprint(\"Odd Numbers:\", odd_numbers)\n```\n\n### Complete Code\n\nCombining all the steps, the complete code looks like this:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Print \"Hello World\"\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\n# Step 2: Recursive function to generate numbers from 1 to 100\ndef generate_numbers(n, max_n):\n    if n > max_n:\n        return []\n    return [n] + generate_numbers(n + 1, max_n)\n\n# Step 3: Store numbers in a list and filter them\nnumbers = generate_numbers(1, 100)\n\n# Sort numbers\nsorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)\n\n# Filter even numbers\neven_numbers = [num for num in sorted_numbers if num % 2 == 0]\n\n# Filter odd numbers\nodd_numbers = [num for num in sorted_numbers if num % 2 != 0]\n\n# Printing the results\nprint(\"Sorted Numbers:\", sorted_numbers)\nprint(\"Even Numbers:\", even_numbers)\nprint(\"Odd Numbers:\", odd_numbers)\n```\n\nThis program will print \"Hello World\", generate numbers from 1 to 100 using a recursive function, and then sort and filter these numbers into even and odd categories."
