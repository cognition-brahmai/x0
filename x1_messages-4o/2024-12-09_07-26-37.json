I couldn't find any Boto methods or parameters that would work with my current code:\n\n```python\nec2 = boto.connect_ec2( ACCESS_KEY, SECRET_KEY, region=region )\n\nreservation = ec2.run_instances( image_id=AMI_ID, \n                                 key_name=EC2_KEY_HANDLE, \n                                 instance_type=INSTANCE_TYPE,\n                                 security_groups = [ SECGROUP_HANDLE, ] )\n```\nI have found resources on how to increase the size of a running EC2-instance's EBS volume using command-line tools, but I would prefer to achieve this with Boto at the time the EC2 instance is specified."

        "content": "To launch a new EC2 instance with a specific size for the boot EBS volume using Boto, you need to specify the block device mapping when you launch the instance. The block device mapping allows you to define the properties of the EBS volumes that will be attached to the instance, including the root/boot volume.\n\nHere's how you can modify your current code to specify the size of the boot EBS volume:\n\n```python\nimport boto.ec2\nfrom boto.ec2.blockdevicemapping import BlockDeviceMapping, EBSBlockDeviceType\n\n# Establish connection to EC2\nec2 = boto.ec2.connect_to_region(region, aws_access_key_id=ACCESS_KEY, aws_secret_access_key=SECRET_KEY)\n\n# Define the block device mapping\nbdm = BlockDeviceMapping()\n\n# Create an EBS block device with the desired size\n# '/dev/sda1' is a common name for the root device, but it might be different depending on the AMI\n# Make sure to check the AMI's block device mapping to use the correct device name\nebs = EBSBlockDeviceType()\nebs.size = DESIRED_SIZE_IN_GB  # Set this to your desired size in GB\n\n# Associate the block device with the instance\nbdm['/dev/sda1'] = ebs\n\n# Launch the instance with the block device mapping\nreservation = ec2.run_instances(\n    image_id=AMI_ID,\n    key_name=EC2_KEY_HANDLE,\n    instance_type=INSTANCE_TYPE,\n    security_groups=[SECGROUP_HANDLE],\n    block_device_map=bdm\n)\n\n# Get the instance\ninstance = reservation.instances[0]\n\nprint(f\"Launched EC2 instance {instance.id} with a {DESIRED_SIZE_IN_GB} GB root EBS volume.\")\n```\n\nIn this script:\n\n- We create a `BlockDeviceMapping` object that describes the desired configuration of the block devices attached to the instance.\n- We define an `EBSBlockDeviceType` object specifying the size of the EBS volume.\n- We map this EBS block device to the device name (e.g., `/dev/sda1`) that corresponds to the root volume of the AMI.\n- We pass the block device mapping to the `run_instances` method to launch the instance with the specified EBS volume size.\n\nMake sure you replace `DESIRED_SIZE_IN_GB` with the actual size you want for the boot EBS volume. Also, verify the device name (`/dev/sda1`) based on the AMI's block device mapping."
