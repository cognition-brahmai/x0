        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that in Python 3, the `urlopen` function has been moved from the `urllib` module to the `urllib.request` module. This change was made to better organize the module's functionality.\n\nHere's how you can update your code to work in Python 3:\n\n```python\nimport urllib.request\n\n# Use urllib.request to open the URL\nresponse = urllib.request.urlopen(\"http://www.python.org\")\n\n# Read the contents of the response\nhtml = response.read()\n\n# Print the HTML source code\nprint(html.decode('utf-8'))\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Import the Correct Module**: Import the `urlopen` function from `urllib.request` instead of `urllib`.\n2. **Reading Data**: The `read()` method returns bytes, so you might want to decode it into a string using `decode('utf-8')` if you're planning to print or manipulate the HTML as a string.\n\n### Explanation:\n- `urllib.request.urlopen()` is now the correct way to open a URL in Python 3.\n- `read()` method reads the entire content of the URL.\n- `decode('utf-8')` is used to convert the bytes to a string, assuming the webpage is encoded using UTF-8, which is a common encoding format for web pages.\n\nMake these changes to your code and it should work without the AttributeError."
