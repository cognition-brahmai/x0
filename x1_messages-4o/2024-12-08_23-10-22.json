Here's a step-by-step explanation of the process:\n\n1. Define the matrix `A` that you want to find the determinant for. In your example, it's a 2x2 matrix:\n   ```matlab\n   A = [1 2; 3 4];\n   ```\n\n2. Use the `det` function to calculate the determinant of matrix `A`:\n   ```matlab\n   detA = det(A);\n   ```\n\n3. The result stored in `detA` will be the determinant of matrix `A`.\n\nSo, the complete code you've written is correct, and it will calculate the determinant of the matrix `A`:\n\n```matlab\nA = [1 2; 3 4];\ndetA = det(A);\ndisp(detA);\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, `detA` will hold the value `-2`, which is the determinant of the matrix `A`."
