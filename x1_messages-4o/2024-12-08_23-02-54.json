        "content": "Implementing a system in Ruby to track and manage real-time temperature data involves several components: capturing temperature data, analyzing it with algorithms, adjusting system performance dynamically, and providing a user interface for monitoring and customization. Here's a general outline of how you can achieve these tasks:\n\n### Step 1: Gathering Temperature Data\n\nYou'll need to access system temperature sensors. This can vary by operating system. For Linux, you might use libraries like `sys-filesystem` or access `/sys/class/thermal` directly. On Windows, you might use a gem like `wmi-lite`.\n\n```ruby\n# Example using `sys-filesystem` gem for Linux\nrequire 'sys/filesystem'\n\ndef get_temperature\n  # Example: accessing thermal zone data on Linux systems\n  Dir.glob('/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone*/temp').map do |file|\n    File.read(file).to_i / 1000.0 # Convert millidegree to degree Celsius\n  end\nend\n\nputs \"Current temperatures: #{get_temperature.join(', ')}\"\n```\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing Temperature Data\n\nYou can implement algorithms to analyze the temperature data. Moving averages, trend analysis, or machine learning models can be applied here.\n\n```ruby\ndef analyze_temperature(temperatures)\n  # Example: simple moving average\n  temperatures.sum / temperatures.size\nend\n\ncurrent_temperatures = get_temperature\naverage_temperature = analyze_temperature(current_temperatures)\nputs \"Average temperature: #{average_temperature}\u00b0C\"\n```\n\n### Step 3: Dynamic Performance Adjustment\n\nThis part involves changing system settings based on the temperature. You may modify CPU frequency, restrict CPU-intensive tasks, or trigger cooling mechanisms. This typically requires system-level access and might involve shell commands or external utilities.\n\n```ruby\ndef adjust_performance(average_temperature, threshold = 75)\n  if average_temperature > threshold\n    puts \"Temperature is above threshold! Taking action...\"\n    # Example: reduce CPU frequency or kill high-CPU processes\n    # system(\"cpupower frequency-set -u 1.5GHz\") # Linux command example\n  else\n    puts \"Temperature is within normal range.\"\n  end\nend\n\nadjust_performance(average_temperature)\n```\n\n### Step 4: User Interface\n\nFor a user interface, you could use a GUI library like `Shoes` or `Tk`, or create a simple web-based interface using `Sinatra` or `Rails`.\n\n```ruby\n# Example using Sinatra for a basic web interface\nrequire 'sinatra'\n\nget '/' do\n  @current_temperatures = get_temperature\n  @average_temperature = analyze_temperature(@current_temperatures)\n  erb :index\nend\n\n# views/index.erb\n# <h1>System Temperature Monitor</h1>\n# <p>Current Temperatures: <%= @current_temperatures.join(', ') %> \u00b0C</p>\n# <p>Average Temperature: <%= @average_temperature %> \u00b0C</p>\n# <form action=\"/set_threshold\" method=\"post\">\n#   <label for=\"threshold\">Set Temperature Threshold:</label>\n#   <input type=\"number\" id=\"threshold\" name=\"threshold\" step=\"0.1\" required>\n#   <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Update\">\n# </form>\n\npost '/set_threshold' do\n  @threshold = params[:threshold].to_f\n  # Store the threshold and use it in `adjust_performance`\n  redirect '/'\nend\n\nrun! if app_file == $0\n```\n\n### Considerations\n\n1. **Permissions**: Accessing hardware sensors and adjusting system settings require proper permissions. You might need to run your program with elevated privileges.\n   \n2. **Cross-Platform Support**: Sensor access and system adjustments differ across operating systems. You may need platform-specific implementations.\n\n3. **Safety**: Ensure that any changes to system performance are safe and reversible. Test thoroughly in a controlled environment.\n\n4. **User Interface**: Make sure the UI is intuitive and provides necessary controls without overwhelming the user.\n\nThis is a simplified example to get you started. Depending on your specific requirements, you may need more advanced techniques, especially for prediction and dynamic system adjustments."
