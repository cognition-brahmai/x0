I've noticed that when I fit and transform a new set of training data with the same vectorizer, the vectorizer's feature names are overwritten rather than updated. How can I update the vectorizer's feature names with a new set of training data without losing the feature names from the previous training data? Here's the code I have so far:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nimport numpy as np\n\ntrain_data = [\"football is the sport\",\"gravity is the movie\", \"education is imporatant\"]\nvectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(sublinear_tf=True, max_df=0.5, stop_words='english')\n\nprint \"Applying first train data\"\nX_train = vectorizer.fit_transform(train_data)\nprint vectorizer.get_feature_names()\n\nprint \"\\n\\nApplying second train data\"\ntrain_data = [\"cricket\", \"Transformers is a film\",\"AIMS is a college\"]\nX_train = vectorizer.transform(train_data)\nprint vectorizer.get_feature_names()\n\nprint \"\\n\\nApplying fit transform onto second train data\"\nX_train = vectorizer.fit_transform(train_data)\nprint vectorizer.get_feature_names()\n```\n\nThe output I'm getting is:\n\n```python\nApplying first train data\n[u'education', u'football', u'gravity', u'imporatant', u'movie', u'sport']\n\nApplying second train data\n[u'education', u'football', u'gravity', u'imporatant', u'movie', u'sport']\n\nApplying fit transform onto second train data\n[u'aims', u'college', u'cricket', u'film', u'transformers']\n```\n\nWhat I want to achieve is an output like this:\n```python\n[u'education', u'football', u'gravity', u'imporatant', u'movie', u'sport',u'aims', u'college', u'cricket', u'film', u'transformers']\n```"

        "content": "To achieve the desired outcome where you maintain the features from the first training data and update with new features from the second training data without overwriting, you will need to manually combine the vocabulary from both datasets. The `TfidfVectorizer` does not inherently support merging vocabularies from multiple datasets directly. However, you can achieve this by following these steps:\n\n1. Fit the vectorizer on the first dataset and extract the vocabulary.\n2. Fit a new vectorizer on the second dataset.\n3. Merge the vocabularies from both vectorizers.\n4. Create a new `TfidfVectorizer` with the combined vocabulary and fit-transform the combined dataset.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n\n# Initial train data\ntrain_data_1 = [\"football is the sport\", \"gravity is the movie\", \"education is imporatant\"]\nvectorizer_1 = TfidfVectorizer(sublinear_tf=True, max_df=0.5, stop_words='english')\n\n# Fit first train data\nprint(\"Applying first train data\")\nX_train_1 = vectorizer_1.fit_transform(train_data_1)\nvocab_1 = vectorizer_1.vocabulary_\nprint(vectorizer_1.get_feature_names_out())\n\n# Second train data\ntrain_data_2 = [\"cricket\", \"Transformers is a film\", \"AIMS is a college\"]\nvectorizer_2 = TfidfVectorizer(sublinear_tf=True, max_df=0.5, stop_words='english')\n\n# Fit second train data\nprint(\"\\n\\nApplying second train data\")\nX_train_2 = vectorizer_2.fit_transform(train_data_2)\nvocab_2 = vectorizer_2.vocabulary_\nprint(vectorizer_2.get_feature_names_out())\n\n# Merge vocabularies\ncombined_vocab = {word: idx for idx, word in enumerate(sorted(set(vocab_1.keys()).union(vocab_2.keys())))}\n\n# Create a new vectorizer with the combined vocabulary\nvectorizer_combined = TfidfVectorizer(sublinear_tf=True, max_df=0.5, stop_words='english', vocabulary=combined_vocab)\n\n# Fit-transform the combined datasets\nprint(\"\\n\\nApplying fit transform onto combined train data\")\nX_train_combined = vectorizer_combined.fit_transform(train_data_1 + train_data_2)\nprint(vectorizer_combined.get_feature_names_out())\n```\n\nThis script will give you the desired output with features from both datasets combined:\n\n```\n[u'aims', u'college', u'cricket', u'education', u'film', u'football', u'gravity', u'imporatant', u'movie', u'sport', u'transformers']\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that you maintain and merge the vocabulary from multiple datasets effectively."
