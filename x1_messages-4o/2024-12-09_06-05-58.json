I've tried using the test_request_context() method with test_client(), but it does not seem to be setting the request.args object. Here is the code I've tried:\n\n```python\nwith self.app.test_client() as c:\n    with self.app.test_request_context() as req:\n        req.request.args = {'code': 'mocked access token'}\n        resp = c.get('/myview')\n```\nThis code, however, does not seem to be setting the request.args object. Is there an alternative method I can use to set the request.args object?"

        "content": "When testing a Flask application with `test_client`, you don't need to mock `request.args` directly. Instead, you can pass query parameters as part of the URL when making a request using the test client. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve that:\n\n```python\nwith self.app.test_client() as c:\n    # Pass query parameters in the URL\n    resp = c.get('/myview', query_string={'code': 'mocked access token'})\n```\n\nIn this code, the `query_string` argument is used to provide the query parameters that will populate `request.args` in your view function. This approach emulates how a real HTTP GET request would include query parameters, and `Flask` will handle parsing them into `request.args` for you.\n\nThis way, when your view function is called, `request.args['code']` will return `'mocked access token'` as expected."
