        "content": "To analyze the sentence \"The phoenix quickly flew away,\" let's break it down into its components and categorize each part:\n\n1. **Subject**: \"The phoenix\"  \n   - Explanation: The subject of the sentence is \"The phoenix,\" which is the noun phrase that performs the action of the verb. It is the main focus of the sentence, indicating the entity that is carrying out the action of flying.\n\n2. **Verb**: \"flew\"  \n   - Explanation: The verb in this sentence is \"flew,\" which is the action performed by the subject. It describes what the phoenix is doing.\n\n3. **Direct Object**: None  \n   - Explanation: A direct object receives the action of the verb. In this sentence, there is no direct object because the verb \"flew\" is intransitive and does not require an object to complete its meaning.\n\n4. **Indirect Object**: None  \n   - Explanation: An indirect object is typically the recipient of the direct object. Since there is no direct object in this sentence, there is also no indirect object.\n\n5. **Complement**: None  \n   - Explanation: A complement is a word or phrase that is necessary to complete the meaning of a sentence. In this case, there isn't a complement required to complete the meaning of \"flew.\"\n\n6. **Adverbial Phrase**: \"quickly away\"  \n   - Explanation: The adverbial phrase \"quickly away\" modifies the verb \"flew,\" providing additional information about how the action was performed.\n\n   - **Specific Type of Adverbial Phrase**: The adverbial phrase can be broken down further:\n     - \"quickly\" - Manner (Code: 3): This word describes how the phoenix flew, indicating the speed or manner of the action.\n     - \"away\" - Location (Code: 2): While \"away\" often indicates a direction rather than a specific place, in this context, it functions similarly to a location adverbial by describing the direction or endpoint of the action.\n\nOverall, the sentence structure is centered around the subject \"The phoenix,\" with the verb \"flew\" being modified by the adverbial phrase \"quickly away,\" which provides details about the manner and direction of the action."
