I've observed that most Python projects on GitHub lack automation beyond the installation provided by setup.py. What's the reason behind this? Do Python developers prefer running style checks, tests, etc. manually? For example, tasks like setting up dependencies, calling pep8 and pylint command line tools, running tests, compiling coffeescripts to minified javascript, deploying the project, or calling sphinx with appropriate arguments are all automated in other languages. Is there a specific reason why Python does not follow this trend?"

        "content": "Python developers have historically had a different approach to automation compared to developers in languages like Ruby or JavaScript. Here are a few reasons why Makefiles and similar tools aren't as prevalent in Python projects:\n\n1. **Python's Philosophy**: Python emphasizes readability and simplicity. Many Python developers prefer straightforward scripts over complex build tools. This often leads to simple shell scripts or Python scripts being used for automation tasks instead of Makefiles.\n\n2. **Virtual Environments**: Python projects often rely on virtual environments to manage dependencies, which is a more isolated and controlled setup compared to global installations. Tools like `venv` and `virtualenv` make dependency management straightforward without needing a Makefile.\n\n3. **Pip and SetupTools**: Historically, `setup.py` and `setuptools` have been the go-to tools for package management and installation. They provide some automation capabilities, though they are primarily focused on packaging and distribution rather than build automation.\n\n4. **Task Automation Tools**: While not as prevalent as Makefiles, there are Python-specific tools for task automation like `invoke` and `doit`. These tools are often more Pythonic and integrate well with Python projects, but they aren't as widely adopted as similar tools in other ecosystems.\n\n5. **Diverse Ecosystem**: Python's vast ecosystem means that developers often use a variety of tools tailored to specific needs. For example, `tox` is commonly used for testing across multiple environments, while `flit` and `poetry` are newer tools for managing dependencies and packaging.\n\n6. **Simple Scripts**: For many Python projects, simple shell scripts or Python scripts suffice for automation tasks. Developers might write scripts to run tests, lint code, or deploy applications without needing a formal build system.\n\n7. **Cultural Factors**: The Python community has a culture of pragmatism and simplicity, which sometimes leads to less formal build systems compared to other languages. This culture influences the tools and practices that are adopted.\n\nOverall, while Python does have tools for automation, the community often opts for straightforward solutions that align with Python's philosophy of simplicity and readability. However, as the ecosystem evolves, we may see more standardized approaches to automation in Python projects."
