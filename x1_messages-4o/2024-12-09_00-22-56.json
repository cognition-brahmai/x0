I am familiar with string formatting in Python but I am having difficulty applying it in this context. Here is the current output of my code:\n\n```python\ndf1.groupby('dept')['data1'].sum()\n\ndept\nvalue1       1.192433e+08\nvalue2       1.293066e+08\nvalue3       1.077142e+08\n```\n\nI can suppress the scientific notation by converting to a string, but I am not sure how to string format and add decimals. Here is the code I use to convert to a string:\n\n```python\nsum_sales_dept.astype(str)\n```\n\nHow can I modify the output of the groupby operation so it doesn't show scientific notation and allows me to add decimals?"

        "content": "You can format the output of a Pandas `groupby` operation by using the `apply` method to format each value in the resulting Series. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Use the `apply` method to format each value.\n2. Use Python's string formatting to specify the desired number format.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to achieving this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample dataframe\ndata = {'dept': ['value1', 'value2', 'value3', 'value1', 'value2', 'value3'],\n        'data1': [50000000.5, 60000000.7, 40000000.9, 69243300.3, 69306600.1, 67714200.6]}\n\ndf1 = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Group by 'dept' and sum 'data1'\nsum_sales_dept = df1.groupby('dept')['data1'].sum()\n\n# Format the numbers to have comma as thousand separator and two decimal places\nformatted_sum_sales_dept = sum_sales_dept.apply(lambda x: f\"{x:,.2f}\")\n\nprint(formatted_sum_sales_dept)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- The `groupby` operation is performed to sum up the values in the `'data1'` column for each `'dept'`.\n- The `apply` method is used on the resulting Series to format each value using Python string formatting.\n- The format specifier `\"{x:,.2f}\"` ensures that the numbers are formatted with commas as thousand separators and two decimal places.\n\nThis will give you an output without scientific notation and with the desired number of decimal places. Here\u2019s how the formatted output will look:\n\n```\ndept\nvalue1    119,243,300.80\nvalue2    129,306,600.80\nvalue3    107,714,200.90\ndtype: object\n```\n\nThis approach provides a clear and human-readable format for large numbers."
