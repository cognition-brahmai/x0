Sometimes when I right-click on a function or method with a doctest, the option \"Run 'Doctest my_function_name'\" is available, and other times, only the option to run the whole file (not as a doctest) is presented. What determines when the \"run doctest\" option will appear and when it will not? Is there a way to control this?"

        "content": "Running doctests in PyCharm can sometimes be a bit tricky due to the way PyCharm detects and integrates doctests. Here are some factors that can affect whether the \"Run 'Doctest my_function_name'\" option appears and how you can control it:\n\n1. **Proper Syntax**: Ensure that your doctests are written correctly. PyCharm needs to recognize the doctest format, which typically includes the `>>>` prompt followed by the expected output in comments.\n\n2. **File Recognition**: PyCharm needs to recognize the file as containing doctests. This typically means having a Python file (`.py`) where the doctests are within a function or class docstring.\n\n3. **Inspection Settings**: PyCharm uses inspections to detect various elements in your code. Make sure that the inspections related to doctests are enabled. You can check this under `File > Settings > Editor > Inspections` and ensure that anything related to doctests is enabled.\n\n4. **Project Interpreter**: Ensure that your project interpreter is set correctly and includes the necessary modules for running doctests. You can configure this under `File > Settings > Project: [Your Project Name] > Python Interpreter`.\n\n5. **Configuration**: You can manually create a run configuration for doctests in a specific file or function:\n   - Go to `Run > Edit Configurations`.\n   - Click the `+` to add a new configuration and select `Python tests > Doctests`.\n   - Specify the target script or function for which you want to run doctests.\n\n6. **Scope of Right-Click**: The context in which you right-click can affect what options appear. For instance, right-clicking directly on the function definition line might show more specific options than right-clicking elsewhere in the file.\n\n7. **PyCharm Version**: Ensure you are using an updated version of PyCharm, as newer versions may have better support and features for running doctests.\n\nIf the option still does not appear, you can always run doctests manually using the terminal with the command:\n```bash\npython -m doctest your_file.py\n```\n\nBy ensuring these settings and conditions are met, you should have more consistent results with running doctests directly from PyCharm."
