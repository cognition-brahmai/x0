        "content": "In the British monarchy, the upbringing, educational development, and cultural immersion of royal children, including the third child, are primarily the responsibility of the parents, with the support of a team that may include nannies, governesses, and tutors. During Queen Elizabeth II's reign, this responsibility would typically fall to the parents, such as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for their children.\n\nThe role of the parents is to ensure that the child receives a well-rounded education, encompassing both academic and cultural elements, and is prepared to fulfill any future royal duties. This includes selecting appropriate schools, overseeing extracurricular activities, and imparting values and traditions associated with the royal family.\n\nHistorically, the British royal family has employed professional caregivers to assist with childcare. For example, Prince Charles, Queen Elizabeth II's eldest son, was cared for by a governess named Catherine Peebles and later by his nanny, Mabel Anderson. These individuals played significant roles in the early education and upbringing of the royal children, ensuring they adhered to royal protocols while also experiencing normal childhood activities.\n\nThe involvement of the royal family's wider network, including grandparents and other relatives, can also play a part in the child's cultural immersion. Queen Elizabeth II herself was influenced by her grandmother, Queen Mary, and her mother, the Queen Mother, who both played roles in her formative years.\n\nIn summary, while there isn't a single figure formally designated to oversee the upbringing of the third child specifically, it is a collaborative effort led by the parents, supported by professionals and the extended family, to ensure the child's development aligns with royal traditions and responsibilities."
