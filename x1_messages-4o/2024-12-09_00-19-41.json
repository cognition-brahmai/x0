For instance, when I run this code, the list variable seems to be acting like a class variable:\n\n```python\nclass testClass():\n    list = []\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.list.append('thing')\n\np = testClass()\nprint(p.list)\n\nf = testClass()\nprint(f.list)\n```\n\nThe output is:\n\n```\n['thing']\n['thing', 'thing']\n```\n\nHowever, when I run this code, it seems to act like an instance variable:\n\n```python\nclass testClass():\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.list = []\n        self.list.append('thing')\n\np = testClass()\nprint(p.list)\n\nf = testClass()\nprint(f.list)\n```\n\nThe output is:\n\n```\n['thing']\n['thing']\n```\n\nWhy is there a difference in behavior?"

        "content": "The difference in behavior you're observing is due to the distinction between class variables and instance variables in Python.\n\n### Class Variables\n\nIn your first example:\n\n```python\nclass testClass():\n    list = []  # This is a class variable\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.list.append('thing')\n```\n\n- `list` is defined at the class level, which means it is shared across all instances of the class. Therefore, when you append `'thing'` to `self.list`, you're actually modifying the class-level variable.\n- Every instance of `testClass` will reference the same `list`, so changes made by one instance will be reflected in others.\n\nThis is why when you create two instances (`p` and `f`), both `p.list` and `f.list` show the cumulative additions to the shared class-level list.\n\n### Instance Variables\n\nIn your second example:\n\n```python\nclass testClass():\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.list = []  # This is an instance variable\n        self.list.append('thing')\n```\n\n- `list` is defined within the `__init__` method, making it an instance variable. Each instance of `testClass` will have its own separate `list`.\n- When you create a new instance, a new list is created and assigned to `self.list`, ensuring that each instance has its own independent copy.\n\nThat's why when you print `p.list` and `f.list`, they each contain only one `'thing'`, as each instance manages its own separate list.\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Class Variables:** Shared among all instances. Defined directly within the class.\n- **Instance Variables:** Unique to each instance. Defined within methods, typically `__init__`.\n\nTo avoid unexpected behaviors like the one in your first example, use instance variables when you need each object to maintain its own state."
