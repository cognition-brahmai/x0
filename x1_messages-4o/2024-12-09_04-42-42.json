Now, I want to display a page on which users can see all contributions to a certain contest. The images should be ordered by their score. I tried using `Contest.objects.get( pk = id ).image_set.order_by( 'score' )` to order the images, but it doesn't work because 'score' is not a database field that could be used in queries. How can I order my QuerySet by the aggregate field value 'score'?\n\nHere are my models:\n```python\nclass Contest:\n    title = models.CharField( max_length = 200 )\n    description = models.TextField()\n\nclass Image:\n    title = models.CharField( max_length = 200 )\n    description = models.TextField()\n    contest = models.ForeignKey( Contest )\n    user = models.ForeignKey( User )\n\n    def score( self ):\n        return self.vote_set.all().aggregate( models.Sum( 'value' ) )[ 'value__sum' ]\n\nclass Vote:\n    value = models.SmallIntegerField()\n    user = models.ForeignKey( User )\n    image = models.ForeignKey( Image )\n```"

        "content": "To order the images by their score, you need to calculate the score for each image within your query. Since the score is derived from the `Vote` model, you can use Django's annotation and aggregation capabilities to achieve this.\n\nHere's how you can modify your query to annotate each `Image` with its score and then order by that score:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db.models import Sum\n\n# Retrieve the contest\ncontest = Contest.objects.get(pk=id)\n\n# Annotate each image with its score and order by score in descending order\nimages_with_scores = contest.image_set.annotate(score=Sum('vote__value')).order_by('-score')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **`annotate(score=Sum('vote__value'))`:** This line adds a `score` field to each `Image` in the QuerySet, which is the sum of the `value` field from the `Vote` model related to that particular `Image`.\n\n2. **`order_by('-score')`:** This orders the images in descending order based on their scores, so the image with the highest score comes first.\n\n### Benefits of this approach:\n- Efficiently calculates the score on the database level, which is much more efficient than calculating it in Python, especially for large datasets.\n- Allows you to order the images directly based on the calculated score.\n\nWith this approach, you can easily display the images sorted by their score on your contest page."
