The statement you came across in \"Dive into Python 3\" might be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation. \n\nHere's how you can verify this information:\n\n1. **Documentation Check**: You can always refer to the official Python documentation. For Python 3, the `readlines()` method for file objects is documented to return a list of lines. You can find this in the Python documentation under file objects.\n\n2. **Code Verification**: You can verify the behavior by testing it in Python:\n\n   ```python\n   with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n       lines = file.readlines()\n       print(type(lines))\n   ```\n\n   If you run this code, `type(lines)` will output `<class 'list'>`, confirming that `readlines()` returns a list.\n\n3. **Alternative Methods**: In Python 3, if you want an iterator over the lines of a file, you can simply iterate over the file object itself, like this:\n\n   ```python\n   with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n       for line in file:\n           print(line)\n   ```\n\nThis method of iterating over the file object directly is both memory-efficient and aligns with the behavior of `xreadlines()` from Python 2. \n\nIn summary, `readlines()` returns a list in Python 3, and for an iterator-like behavior, you can iterate directly over the file object."
