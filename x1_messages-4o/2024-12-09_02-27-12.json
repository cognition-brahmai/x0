        "content": "Yes, you can adjust the size of the plots in Jupyter Notebook by setting the figure size using Matplotlib's `plt.figure()` function or by adjusting the default figure size in the Matplotlib configuration. Here are a few ways you can increase the size of your plots:\n\n1. **Set the figure size for individual plots:**\n\n   You can specify the size of a plot by using the `figsize` argument in the `plt.figure()` function before you plot:\n\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))  # Width, Height in inches\n   plt.plot(x, y)\n   plt.show()\n   ```\n\n   Adjust the `figsize` values to your desired width and height.\n\n2. **Set the default figure size for all plots:**\n\n   You can change the default figure size for all plots in your notebook by modifying the `rcParams`:\n\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n   plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [10, 6]  # Width, Height in inches\n   ```\n\n   This will set the default size for all plots to 10 inches by 6 inches.\n\n3. **Using `%config InlineBackend.figure_format`:**\n\n   You can also adjust the figure format and resolution to make plots clearer, which can sometimes make them appear larger:\n\n   ```python\n   %config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'  # For high-resolution displays\n   ```\n\nBy using these methods, you can adjust the size of your plots to better suit your needs in Jupyter Notebook."
