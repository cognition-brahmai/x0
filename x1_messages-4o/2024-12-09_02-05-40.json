I have written some Python code to read the text file and generate the scatter plot. However, I am struggling to overplot a line of best fit to the data in the scatter plot. None of the built-in pylab functions seem to work for me. Can someone help me modify my code to achieve this?\n\nHere is my current code:\n\n```python\nfrom matplotlib import *\nfrom pylab import *\n\nwith open('file.txt') as f:\n   data = [line.split() for line in f.readlines()]\n   out = [(float(x), float(y)) for x, y in data]\nfor i in out:\n   scatter(i[0],i[1])\n   xlabel('X')\n   ylabel('Y')\n   title('My Title')\nshow()\n```"

        "content": "To add a line of best fit to your scatter plot, you can use the `numpy` library to compute the coefficients for the best fit line and then use `matplotlib` to plot it. Here's how you can modify your existing code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Read data from the file\nwith open('file.txt') as f:\n    data = [line.split() for line in f.readlines()]\n    out = [(float(x), float(y)) for x, y in data]\n\n# Separate the data into x and y coordinates\nx_coords, y_coords = zip(*out)\n\n# Create the scatter plot\nplt.scatter(x_coords, y_coords, label='Data Points')\n\n# Calculate the line of best fit\ncoefficients = np.polyfit(x_coords, y_coords, 1)\npolynomial = np.poly1d(coefficients)\nx_fit = np.linspace(min(x_coords), max(x_coords), 100)  # Generate x values for the line\ny_fit = polynomial(x_fit)  # Calculate corresponding y values\n\n# Plot the line of best fit\nplt.plot(x_fit, y_fit, color='red', label='Line of Best Fit')\n\n# Add labels and title\nplt.xlabel('X')\nplt.ylabel('Y')\nplt.title('Scatter Plot with Line of Best Fit')\nplt.legend()\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Reading Data**: The data is read from `file.txt` and converted into a list of tuples containing floats.\n2. **Scatter Plot**: We use `plt.scatter` to plot the x and y coordinates.\n3. **Line of Best Fit**:\n   - `np.polyfit()` is used to calculate the coefficients of the best fit line, with `1` indicating a linear fit.\n   - `np.poly1d()` creates a polynomial object to evaluate the line.\n   - `x_fit` is a range of x values for plotting the line of best fit smoothly.\n   - `y_fit` calculates the corresponding y values using the polynomial.\n4. **Plotting**: Both the scatter points and the line of best fit are plotted, and labels are added for clarity."
