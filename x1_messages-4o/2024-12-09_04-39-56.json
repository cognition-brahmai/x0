However, I'm noticing that the syntax highlighting isn't as extensive as the one provided by Visual Studio Community with Python tools. For example, in VS Community, imported packages are highlighted in purple and classes in light blue, whereas in VS Code, these elements are not highlighted the same way as shown in the attached image. How can I get the same Python syntax highlighting in VS Code as in VS Community?"

        "content": "To achieve similar syntax highlighting in Visual Studio Code as you see in Visual Studio Community, you can customize your VS Code setup by using different themes and extensions that enhance syntax highlighting. Here's what you can do:\n\n1. **Install a Different Theme**:\n   - Visual Studio Code supports a wide range of themes that can change the color scheme and syntax highlighting. You can search for themes that closely resemble Visual Studio Community. \n   - Some popular themes to consider are \"One Dark Pro,\" \"Dracula Official,\" or \"Monokai Pro.\" You can search for these in the Extensions Marketplace within VS Code.\n\n2. **Customize the Theme**:\n   - If you find a theme that is close but not exactly what you want, you can customize it further.\n   - Go to `File > Preferences > Settings` (or press `Ctrl + ,`) and search for `editor.tokenColorCustomizations`. Here you can specify custom colors for different syntax tokens by editing the settings.json file. You can refer to the [VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings) for guidance on how to do this.\n\n3. **Use Syntax Highlighting Extensions**:\n   - There are extensions specifically designed to enhance Python syntax highlighting. You can try extensions such as \"MagicPython\" or \"Python Extended\" to see if they offer better highlighting for your needs.\n   - Search for these extensions in the Extensions Marketplace and install them.\n\n4. **Check for Updates**:\n   - Ensure your Python extension is up to date, as updates can sometimes improve features like syntax highlighting.\n\n5. **Adjust Language Settings**:\n   - VS Code allows you to define custom settings for specific languages. Go to `File > Preferences > Settings`, and navigate to the Python-specific settings to see if there are any options related to syntax highlighting that you can adjust.\n\nBy experimenting with these options, you should be able to achieve a syntax highlighting scheme in VS Code that closely resembles what you get with Visual Studio Community."
