For example, I have two series, Sr1 and Sr2, where Sr1 = pd.Series([1,2,3,4], index = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']) and Sr2 = pd.Series([5,6], index = ['A', 'C']). When I perform Sr1 + Sr2 or Sr1.add(Sr2), I get NaNs for indices 'B' and 'D'. However, I would like to retain the original values in Sr1 for these indices. Any suggestions?"

        "content": "To add two pandas Series with different indices and retain the original values for the indices that do not overlap, you can use the `add()` method with the `fill_value` parameter. This parameter allows you to specify a value to substitute for missing data in either series during the addition. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Define the series\nSr1 = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4], index=['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'])\nSr2 = pd.Series([5, 6], index=['A', 'C'])\n\n# Add the two series with a fill_value of 0\nresult = Sr1.add(Sr2, fill_value=0)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nA    6.0\nB    2.0\nC    9.0\nD    4.0\ndtype: float64\n```\n\nIn this approach, `fill_value=0` ensures that missing values in either series during the addition are treated as 0, so the original values from `Sr1` are retained for indices 'B' and 'D'."
