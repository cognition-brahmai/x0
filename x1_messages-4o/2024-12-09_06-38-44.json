I am working in an IPython environment and using matplotlib to plot a simple line graph. However, when I call the show() function, nothing happens - no error message, no new window, just nothing. I installed matplotlib using pip and did not receive any error messages. For reference, I am using Ubuntu, IPython v0.11, Python v2.6.6, and matplotlib v1.0.1. Here's the code I'm running:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as p \np.plot(range(20), range(20))\np.show()\n```\n\nThe plot command returns `matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0xade2b2c` as the output, but no graph is displayed. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "It sounds like you might be encountering an issue with the backend that Matplotlib is using in your IPython environment. Here are a few steps to help resolve this:\n\n1. **Ensure Inline Backend for IPython Notebook:** If you're using IPython Notebook (Jupyter), you need to ensure that plots are rendered inline. You can do this by including the following magic command in a notebook cell before your plotting code:\n\n   ```python\n   %matplotlib inline\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Backend Configuration:** If you're not in a notebook environment or the above step doesn't work, check which backend Matplotlib is using. You can do this by running:\n\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib\n   print(matplotlib.get_backend())\n   ```\n\n   If the backend is not suitable for your environment (e.g., 'Agg' is for file output only), you can change it to a suitable interactive backend like 'TkAgg', 'Qt5Agg', or 'GTK3Agg'. You can change the backend by modifying your script as follows:\n\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib\n   matplotlib.use('TkAgg')  # or 'Qt5Agg', 'GTK3Agg', etc.\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as p\n   ```\n\n3. **Install Required Libraries:** Ensure that the necessary GUI libraries are installed on your system for the backend you choose. For example, for 'TkAgg', you need Tkinter, which you can install using:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install python-tk\n   ```\n\n4. **Update Your Environment:** Consider updating your Python, IPython, and Matplotlib to more recent versions, as older versions may have compatibility issues. Python 2.6.6 is quite old, and upgrading to Python 3.x is recommended if possible.\n\n5. **Testing with a Simple Script:** Try running your script outside of IPython in a simple Python script to see if the issue persists. This can help isolate whether the problem is specific to the IPython environment.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with Matplotlib not displaying plots in your IPython environment. If the problem persists, consider checking for any specific error messages or logs that might provide additional clues."
