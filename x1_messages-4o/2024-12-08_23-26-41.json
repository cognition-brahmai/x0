        "content": "Let's break down the problem and think through a possible solution using JavaScript. \n\n### Potential Limitation:\nA significant constraint with the next major breakthrough in virtual reality (VR) could indeed be a lack of compatibility with current hardware. This could manifest as a need for more advanced processing capabilities, better graphics handling, or new input/output methods that existing systems don't support.\n\n### Solution Approach:\nWe can create a JavaScript library that acts as a compatibility layer between existing hardware and new VR applications. This library could help bridge the gap by optimizing performance, translating input/output, and providing polyfills for unsupported features.\n\n### Key Features of the Library:\n1. **Performance Optimization:** Dynamically adjust graphics settings or use WebAssembly for computationally intensive tasks.\n2. **Input/Output Translation:** Map new VR input/output methods to those supported by existing hardware.\n3. **Feature Polyfills:** Implement polyfills for new VR features that aren't supported natively by older hardware.\n\n### JavaScript Code Outline:\n\n```javascript\nclass VRCompatibilityLayer {\n    constructor() {\n        this.init();\n    }\n\n    init() {\n        this.checkHardwareCapabilities();\n        this.applyPerformanceOptimizations();\n        this.setupInputOutputMappings();\n        this.loadFeaturePolyfills();\n    }\n\n    checkHardwareCapabilities() {\n        // Detect hardware capabilities\n        console.log(\"Checking hardware capabilities...\");\n        // Example: Check for WebGL support\n        if (!this.isWebGLSupported()) {\n            console.warn(\"WebGL not supported, applying fallback.\");\n            this.enableCanvasFallback();\n        }\n    }\n\n    isWebGLSupported() {\n        try {\n            const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');\n            return !!window.WebGLRenderingContext && (canvas.getContext('webgl') || canvas.getContext('experimental-webgl'));\n        } catch (e) {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n\n    enableCanvasFallback() {\n        // Implement a fallback using 2D Canvas or other methods\n    }\n\n    applyPerformanceOptimizations() {\n        console.log(\"Applying performance optimizations...\");\n        // Implement WebAssembly or other optimizations if needed\n    }\n\n    setupInputOutputMappings() {\n        console.log(\"Setting up input/output mappings...\");\n        // Map new VR inputs to existing hardware inputs\n    }\n\n    loadFeaturePolyfills() {\n        console.log(\"Loading feature polyfills...\");\n        // Implement polyfills for features not supported by older hardware\n    }\n}\n\n// Usage:\nconst vrCompatibilityLayer = new VRCompatibilityLayer();\n\n// Now, integrate this compatibility layer with your VR application\n```\n\n### Future Enhancements:\n- **Dynamic Configuration:** Allow users to configure or tweak settings based on their specific hardware.\n- **Community Contributions:** Open-source the library to enable community contributions for a wider range of hardware compatibility.\n- **Machine Learning:** Use AI to predict and optimize settings based on usage patterns.\n\nBy using such a compatibility layer, developers can make their VR applications more accessible to users with a variety of hardware configurations, prolonging the life of existing devices and expanding the reach of new VR technologies."
