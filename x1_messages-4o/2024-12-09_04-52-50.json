I prefer to avoid hardcoding the class name, and would rather use something like `class(self).static_var += 1`. Is there a way to achieve this?\n\n```python\nclass ReallyLongClassName:\n\n    static_var = 5\n\n    def instance_method(self):\n        ReallyLongClassName.static_var += 1\n```"

        "content": "In Python, you can access a class's static or class variables from an instance method without hardcoding the class name by using the `type` function. The `type(self)` will give you the class of the instance, allowing you to access class variables dynamically. Here's how you can modify your `instance_method` to achieve this:\n\n```python\nclass ReallyLongClassName:\n    static_var = 5\n\n    def instance_method(self):\n        type(self).static_var += 1\n\n# Example usage:\nobj = ReallyLongClassName()\nprint(ReallyLongClassName.static_var)  # Output: 5\nobj.instance_method()\nprint(ReallyLongClassName.static_var)  # Output: 6\n```\n\nUsing `type(self)` is effectively the same as using the class name directly, but it allows you to avoid hardcoding the class name in your method, which can be helpful if you want to maintain flexibility or reuse the method in subclasses."
