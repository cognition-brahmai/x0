The problem I'm facing is that whenever I use the `pd.read_csv` method, the first row which should be data is being treated as column names. I've tried using `header=False`, but this ends up deleting the first row. My data is being processed from a string (`st = '\\n'.join(lst)`) which I then convert to a file-like object using `io.StringIO(st)`, then I build the CSV from that file object."

        "content": "When using `pd.read_csv` to read CSV data, if you want to ensure that the first row is treated as data rather than column names, you should specify `header=None`. This tells pandas not to interpret any of the rows as column headers, and instead, it will assign default integer-based column names. Since you mentioned that using `header=False` deletes the first row, it's possible there may be some misunderstanding with how the file is being read or the format of the data. Let's address this step by step:\n\n1. **Ensure Data Format**: Make sure that your data string is properly formatted with the correct delimiters (e.g., commas) and no unexpected characters.\n\n2. **Use `io.StringIO`**: As you've mentioned, you're already converting your string to a file-like object using `io.StringIO`. This is correct.\n\n3. **Read with `header=None`**: Use `pd.read_csv` with the `header=None` parameter to make sure pandas treats every row as data.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport io\n\n# Example list of strings representing CSV data\nlst = [\n    \"val1,val2,val3\",\n    \"1,2,3\",\n    \"4,5,6\"\n]\n\n# Convert the list of strings into a single string with newlines\nst = '\\n'.join(lst)\n\n# Convert the string into a file-like object\nfile_like_object = io.StringIO(st)\n\n# Read the CSV data with no header\ndf = pd.read_csv(file_like_object, header=None)\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nThis should output:\n\n```\n   0  1  2\n0  val1  val2  val3\n1    1    2    3\n2    4    5    6\n```\n\nIn this case, pandas assigns integer-based column names `[0, 1, 2]` while treating your first row as data. If you want to assign specific column names later, you can do so by setting `df.columns` to a list of your desired column names."
