I tried using the following code:\n\n```python\ndf = DataFrame({'A': range(1, 11), 'B': np.random.randn(10)})\ndf.assign(ln_A = lambda x: np.log(x.A))\ndf.assign(ln(A) = lambda x: np.log(x.A))\ndf.assign(\"ln(A)\" = lambda x: np.log(x.A))\n```\nBut I am getting a SyntaxError:\n\n```\nFile \"<ipython-input-7-de0da86dce68>\", line 1\ndf.assign(ln(A) = lambda x: np.log(x.A))\nSyntaxError: keyword can't be an expression\n```\n\nI am aware that I can rename the column right after the .assign call, but I want to understand more about this method and its syntax. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "The `assign` method in pandas does not support column names with spaces or special characters like parentheses directly in the method call because it uses keyword argument syntax, which requires valid Python identifiers. However, there are a couple of ways to work around this.\n\nOne approach is to use a dictionary with `**` unpacking, since dictionary keys can be any string:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Create a DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'A': range(1, 11), 'B': np.random.randn(10)})\n\n# Use a dictionary to assign a new column with a special name\nnew_column_name = \"ln(A)\"\ndf = df.assign(**{new_column_name: lambda x: np.log(x['A'])})\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nIn this example, `**{new_column_name: lambda x: np.log(x['A'])}` unpacks the dictionary into keyword arguments, allowing you to use any string as a column name.\n\nAlternatively, you could assign the new column using direct assignment after the `assign` call:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Create a DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'A': range(1, 11), 'B': np.random.randn(10)})\n\n# Assign the new column using a temporary column name\ndf = df.assign(ln_A=lambda x: np.log(x['A']))\n\n# Rename the temporary column to include special characters\ndf = df.rename(columns={'ln_A': 'ln(A)'})\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nBoth methods achieve the same result, but using `**` unpacking is more direct if you want to maintain a single `assign` step."
