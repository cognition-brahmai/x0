After setting up a virtual environment to run Django, I noticed that \"(base)\" started appearing in front of my Anaconda command prompt, like so: \"(base) C:\\users\\user_name>\". If I type 'deactivate', the prompt disappears, but it reappears when I close the terminal and open a new one. Additionally, this prompt does not recognize pip or any Anaconda commands. I can run pip on the 'base' prompt, but not on the original one. Also, I installed a module in '(base)...' using pip but my IDE is not recognizing this module. Running \"conda list anaconda\" in \"(base)..\" gives the version of Anaconda as 4.4. Without the 'base', it does not recognize conda. I have run pip and conda several times before this happened. I'm running Windows 10. Why is this happening, and how can I fix it?"

        "content": "The `(base)` appearing in your Anaconda command prompt indicates that the base environment of Anaconda is currently active. This is the default environment that is activated when you start the Anaconda prompt. Here's a breakdown of what's happening and how you can address the issues you're facing:\n\n1. **Base Environment Activation**: By default, the Anaconda installation sets the base environment to be activated automatically when you open the Anaconda command prompt. This is why you see `(base)` at the beginning of the prompt.\n\n2. **Deactivating the Base Environment**: You can deactivate the base environment by typing `conda deactivate`. However, as you noticed, it will reactivate the next time you open a new Anaconda prompt because it's set to do so by default.\n\n3. **Setting Default Behavior**: If you want to stop automatically activating the base environment, you can change this behavior by modifying the Anaconda configuration. Run the following command in your Anaconda prompt:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda config --set auto_activate_base false\n   ```\n\n   This will prevent the base environment from activating automatically when you open the Anaconda prompt.\n\n4. **Virtual Environment Management**: When you create a new virtual environment for your Django project, you should activate it using:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda activate your_env_name\n   ```\n\n   Replace `your_env_name` with the name of your virtual environment. This should allow you to use `pip` and other commands within that environment without interference from the base environment.\n\n5. **IDE Integration**: If your IDE is not recognizing the modules installed in your environment, ensure that your IDE is configured to use the Python interpreter from the correct environment. Most IDEs allow you to specify the Python interpreter in the settings or preferences, so make sure it points to the interpreter in your virtual environment.\n\n6. **Module Installation**: When installing modules, make sure you are in the correct environment. You can check which environment is active by looking at the prompt or by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda info --envs\n   ```\n\n   This command will list all your environments and indicate which one is currently active.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to manage your Anaconda environments more effectively and resolve the issues you're experiencing with module recognition in your IDE."
