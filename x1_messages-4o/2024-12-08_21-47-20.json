The password must contain four words.\n2. The first word must be a color.\n3. The second word must be an animal.\n4. The third word must be a number spelled out in letters.\n5. The fourth word must be a fruit.\nOnce you have created the password, you must use ASCII code to convert each word into a series of numbers. Can you provide me with the final sequence of numbers?"
