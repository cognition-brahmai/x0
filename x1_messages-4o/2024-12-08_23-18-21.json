        "content": "The Earth's structure is composed of several distinct layers, each characterized by unique compositional and mechanical properties. These layers can be categorized based on their chemical composition or their physical properties.\n\n### Compositional Layers:\n\n1. **Crust:**\n   - **Composition:** The crust is the outermost layer of the Earth, composed primarily of silicate rocks. The continental crust is mainly granite, while the oceanic crust is primarily basalt.\n   - **Density:** The continental crust has an average density of about 2.7 g/cm\u00b3, whereas the oceanic crust is denser, averaging around 3.0 g/cm\u00b3.\n   - **Temperature:** Temperatures range from the surface temperature up to about 200-400\u00b0C at the boundary with the mantle.\n   - **Thickness:** The crust varies in thickness, with continental crust averaging about 30-50 km and oceanic crust about 5-10 km.\n\n2. **Mantle:**\n   - **Composition:** Comprised mostly of silicate minerals rich in magnesium and iron, such as olivine and pyroxene.\n   - **Density:** Density increases with depth from about 3.3 g/cm\u00b3 near the crust to about 5.5 g/cm\u00b3 near the core.\n   - **Temperature:** Ranges from about 500\u00b0C near the crust to over 4,000\u00b0C near the core.\n   - **Thickness:** Extends to a depth of about 2,900 km.\n\n3. **Core:**\n   - **Outer Core:**\n     - **Composition:** Composed mainly of liquid iron and nickel.\n     - **Density:** Ranges from about 9.9 to 12.2 g/cm\u00b3.\n     - **Temperature:** Estimated to be between 4,500\u00b0C and 5,500\u00b0C.\n     - **Thickness:** Approximately 2,200 km thick.\n   - **Inner Core:**\n     - **Composition:** Primarily solid iron and nickel.\n     - **Density:** Ranges from about 12.6 to 13.0 g/cm\u00b3.\n     - **Temperature:** Can reach up to about 5,700\u00b0C.\n     - **Radius:** About 1,220 km.\n\n### Mechanical Layers:\n\n1. **Lithosphere:**\n   - **Description:** The rigid outer layer of the Earth, encompassing the crust and the uppermost part of the mantle. It is broken into tectonic plates.\n   - **Properties:** It is solid and relatively cool compared to deeper layers, with temperatures up to about 300-500\u00b0C.\n   - **Thickness:** Varies from about 100 km beneath the ocean to about 200 km beneath continents.\n\n2. **Asthenosphere:**\n   - **Description:** A semi-fluid layer directly beneath the lithosphere, part of the upper mantle.\n   - **Properties:** It is ductile, allowing tectonic plates to move on top of it. Temperatures range from about 1,300\u00b0C to 1,600\u00b0C.\n   - **Thickness:** Extends to about 700 km below the Earth's surface.\n\n3. **Mesosphere (Lower Mantle):**\n   - **Description:** Extends from the bottom of the asthenosphere to the outer core.\n   - **Properties:** More rigid than the asthenosphere due to high pressure, with temperatures ranging from 1,600\u00b0C to over 4,000\u00b0C.\n   - **Thickness:** Extends from about 700 km to 2,900 km depth.\n\n4. **Inner Core Boundary (ICB):**\n   - **Description:** The boundary between the solid inner core and the liquid outer core.\n   - **Properties:** Marks a significant change in the Earth's materials from liquid to solid due to the immense pressures that solidify the iron and nickel despite high temperatures.\n\n### Overall Structure:\n\nThe Earth's layered structure plays a crucial role in geodynamic processes, such as plate tectonics, volcanic activity, and the generation of the planet's magnetic field. The lithosphere's rigid plates move atop the more ductile asthenosphere, leading to seismic and volcanic activity. The outer core's fluid motion generates the Earth's magnetic field, while the solid inner core grows slowly as the Earth cools over geological time scales. The interactions between these layers shape the planet's surface and contribute to its dynamic nature."
