I have a package, 'visdom', that shows up when I use 'conda list', but when I try to import it in Python, I get an ImportError saying 'No module named 'visdom''. I've confirmed that the environment is activated when executing Python. Here's the commands I used and the output:\n\n```\nsource activate MyVirtEnv\nconda list |grep visdom\nvisdom                    0.1.05                        0    conda-forge\n```\nAnd here's the error I get when trying to import visdom in python:\n\n```\npython\nPython 3.5.3 |Anaconda custom (64-bit)| (default, Mar  6 2017, 11:58:13) \n[GCC 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-1)] on linux\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> import visdom\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nImportError: No module named 'visdom'\n>>> \n```\nI also checked the Python sys.path and sys.executable:\n\n```\nsource activate universe\npython\nPython 3.5.3 |Anaconda custom (64-bit)| (default, Mar  6 2017, 11:58:13) \n[GCC 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-1)] on linux\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> import sys\n>>> sys.path\n['', '/home/deeplearning/anaconda3/envs/universe/lib/python35.zip', '/home/deeplearning/anaconda3/envs/universe/lib/python3.5', '/home/deeplearning/anaconda3/envs/universe/lib/python3.5/plat-linux', '/home/deeplearning/anaconda3/envs/universe/lib/python3.5/lib-dynload', '/home/deeplearning/anaconda3/envs/universe/lib/python3.5/site-packages', '/home/deeplearning/anaconda3/envs/universe/lib/python3.5/site-packages/Sphinx-1.5.6-py3.5.egg', '/home/deeplearning/gym', '/home/deeplearning/anaconda3/envs/universe/lib/python3.5/site-packages/torchvision-0.1.9-py3.5.egg']\n>>> sys.executable\n'/home/deeplearning/anaconda3/envs/universe/bin/python'\n>>> \n```\nWhy can't Python recognize this package, even though it seems to be installed correctly?"

        "content": "It looks like you're experiencing an environment issue where Python cannot locate the `visdom` module, despite it being listed in your Conda environment. Here are some steps to help diagnose and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Active Environment**: Ensure the correct environment is activated before running Python. You mentioned activating `MyVirtEnv`, but later your `sys.path` indicates you\u2019re using an environment called `universe`. Verify you are in the correct environment:\n   ```bash\n   source activate MyVirtEnv\n   ```\n\n2. **Reinstall the Package**: Sometimes packages may not be installed correctly, or there might be a mismatch between Python versions. Try reinstalling `visdom`:\n   ```bash\n   conda install -c conda-forge visdom\n   ```\n\n3. **Check Package Installation**: Verify the package is installed in the correct environment. After activating your environment, check the specific `site-packages` directory:\n   ```bash\n   ls /home/deeplearning/anaconda3/envs/MyVirtEnv/lib/python3.5/site-packages/visdom\n   ```\n\n4. **Python Version Consistency**: Ensure that the Python version in your environment matches the one used when executing Python commands. The installed packages need to be compatible with your Python version.\n\n5. **Environment Path Conflicts**: Ensure there are no conflicts in your `sys.path` that might affect module resolution. Sometimes, custom paths or other site-packages can interfere with module imports.\n\n6. **Check for Multiple Python Installations**: Make sure that there is no other Python version interfering with the Conda environment. You can check the Python version and path by running:\n   ```bash\n   which python\n   ```\n\n7. **Create a New Environment**: If issues persist, consider creating a new environment and installing only the necessary packages to isolate the problem:\n   ```bash\n   conda create -n testenv python=3.5\n   source activate testenv\n   conda install -c conda-forge visdom\n   ```\n\n8. **Check for Virtual Box Issues**: If none of the above works, consider any potential issues related to Virtual Box or shared folders that might be impacting file permissions or accessibility.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the ImportError and successfully import `visdom` in your Python environment."
