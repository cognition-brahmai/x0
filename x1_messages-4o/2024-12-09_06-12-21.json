In the project settings, I created a new project interpreter in a venv, inside the /venv folder. However, when I try to install any package like pandas to the project interpreter, I get a Non-zero exit code (2) with the message \"no such option: --build-dir\". When I execute 'pip install pandas' in the Terminal as per PyCharm's 'proposed solution', it installs fine and pandas and its dependencies appear in the list of installed modules in the interpreter. I have not encountered this issue before and could not find any settings where I can specify how PyCharm will invoke pip in this situation. What could be the reason for this issue and how can I resolve it?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering seems to be related to an outdated version of `pip` or a compatibility issue with the version of PyCharm you're using. The `--build-dir` option was removed in recent versions of `pip`, which could be causing the problem if PyCharm is calling `pip` with this outdated option.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Upgrade `pip`**:\n   - Open the terminal in PyCharm or your command prompt.\n   - Run the following command to upgrade `pip`:\n     ```bash\n     python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n     ```\n   - This will ensure you have the latest version of `pip` that is compatible with your version of Python and PyCharm.\n\n2. **Upgrade `setuptools` and `wheel`**:\n   - Similarly, upgrade `setuptools` and `wheel` as these are often tied with the installation process:\n     ```bash\n     python -m pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel\n     ```\n\n3. **Verify the Interpreter Settings**:\n   - Go to **File > Settings > Project: [Your Project Name] > Python Interpreter** in PyCharm.\n   - Ensure that the interpreter path is correct and points to the `venv` you created.\n\n4. **Recreate the Virtual Environment**:\n   - If the issue persists, consider deleting the current virtual environment and creating a new one:\n     - Delete the `/venv` folder.\n     - In PyCharm, go to **File > Settings > Project: [Your Project Name] > Python Interpreter** and click on the gear icon, then select \"Add...\"\n     - Choose \"New environment\" and create a new virtual environment.\n\n5. **Check PyCharm's Package Management**:\n   - If you've upgraded `pip` and recreated the environment, and the issue still persists, check if there are any updates or patches for your version of PyCharm.\n   - Consider upgrading PyCharm to a newer version if available.\n\n6. **Alternative Installation**:\n   - As a temporary workaround, continue installing packages via the terminal using `pip install [package-name]`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with package installation in PyCharm. If the issue persists, consider checking PyCharm's official support channels or forums for additional assistance, as there might be specific patches or updates available for your version."
