Below is a comparison of the verb forms for the sentences provided, along with an explanation of the grammatical correctness:\n\n| Sentence                     | Verb Form Used | Correct Verb Form | Grammatical Correctness | Explanation                                                                 |\n|------------------------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| \"He goed to the store.\"      | Goed           | Went              | Incorrect               | \"Goed\" is not a correct past tense form. The verb \"go\" is irregular and its past tense is \"went\".              |\n| \"He went to the store.\"      | Went           | Went              | Correct                 | \"Went\" is the correct past tense form of the verb \"go\". It follows the irregular verb pattern. |\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Irregular Verbs:** In English, many verbs form their past tense irregularly, meaning they do not simply add \"-ed\" to the base form. \"Go\" is one such irregular verb.\n- **Correct Form:** The past tense of \"go\" is \"went.\" This is an exception to the regular verb pattern where typically \"-ed\" is added to form the past tense.\n- **Grammatical Rule:** When dealing with irregular verbs, it is essential to memorize or reference their unique past tense forms, as they do not follow standard conjugation rules.\n\nThe second sentence, \"He went to the store,\" is grammatically correct because it uses the correct irregular past tense form of the verb \"go.\""
