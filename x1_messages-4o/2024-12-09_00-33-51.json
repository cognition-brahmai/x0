I've found different solutions for specific cases but these require understanding of the encoding being handled. I'm interested in finding a way to read and write both strings and Unicode strings from .csv files that works straightforwardly in Python 2.6. Is there a simple solution to this or is it a limitation of Python 2.6?"

        "content": "Handling UTF-8 and Unicode in Python 2.6 can be a bit tricky due to its limited support for Unicode compared to later versions. However, you can still manage to work with UTF-8 and Unicode data in CSV files with some additional effort. Here's a straightforward approach to read and write CSV files with UTF-8 encoding in Python 2.6.\n\n### Reading CSV Files\n\nTo read a CSV file with UTF-8 encoding, you can use the `csv` module along with the `codecs` module to handle the encoding:\n\n```python\nimport csv\nimport codecs\n\ndef read_csv_utf8(filename):\n    with codecs.open(filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n        reader = csv.reader(f)\n        data = [row for row in reader]\n    return data\n\n# Usage\ndata = read_csv_utf8('your_file.csv')\nfor row in data:\n    print(row)\n```\n\n### Writing CSV Files\n\nWhen writing to a CSV file, you should also handle UTF-8 encoding. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport csv\nimport codecs\n\ndef write_csv_utf8(filename, data):\n    with codecs.open(filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n        writer = csv.writer(f)\n        for row in data:\n            writer.writerow([unicode(col) for col in row])\n\n# Usage\ndata_to_write = [\n    [u'Name', u'Age', u'City'],\n    [u'John Doe', 28, u'New York'],\n    [u'Anna M\u00fcller', 22, u'Berlin']\n]\nwrite_csv_utf8('your_output_file.csv', data_to_write)\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n1. **Encoding Explicitly**: Always specify the encoding explicitly when opening files. This ensures that Python reads and writes in UTF-8, which is essential for handling Unicode characters.\n\n2. **Unicode Literals**: Use `unicode` literals (`u'string'`) in your code for any strings that may contain non-ASCII characters. This is necessary because Python 2.x differentiates between `str` and `unicode` types.\n\n3. **Python 2.6 Limitations**: Python 2.6 is quite old and lacks many of the conveniences found in Python 3.x for handling Unicode. If possible, consider upgrading to a more recent version of Python to make handling Unicode simpler and more robust.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to read and write UTF-8 encoded CSV files in Python 2.6 with minimal hassle."
