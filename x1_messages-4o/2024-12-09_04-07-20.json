        "content": "In Python, I am trying to decide whether to put my helper functions inside or outside of a class. Some methods of the class require a helper function, although the helper function doesn't use anything in the class itself. Should the helper function be placed inside or outside of the class? I tried putting it inside, but I received a complaint from PyLint that the function could have been placed outside. For context, the class is a software upgrader and the helper function creates a new folder if the folder doesn't exist yet. The class is in a module that currently contains mostly code for the class, but other classes may be added later."

        "content": "When deciding whether to place a helper function inside or outside of a class in Python, there are several factors to consider:\n\n1. **Reusability**: If the helper function is something that could be reused by other parts of your application or by other classes in the future, it makes sense to place it outside the class. This way, it can be easily imported and used elsewhere without needing to instantiate the class.\n\n2. **Encapsulation**: If the helper function is specific to the class and contributes to the internal workings of the class, it might make sense to keep it inside the class to maintain encapsulation. However, in your case, since the helper function does not use any class-specific data or methods, this point is less relevant.\n\n3. **Readability and Organization**: Keeping functions that don't interact with class-specific data outside the class can make your code more readable and organized. It separates concerns and makes it clear which functions are utility functions versus those that are integral to the class's functionality.\n\n4. **PyLint and Code Standards**: PyLint warnings, such as the one you received, often guide you towards writing more maintainable and standard-compliant code. If PyLint suggests placing the function outside, it aligns with the common practice of separating utility functions from class methods when they do not interact with the class state.\n\nGiven your scenario, where the helper function creates a new folder if it doesn't exist and doesn't interact with the class's state, it would be a good practice to place it outside the class. This makes the function more versatile and aligns with the single responsibility principle, where each part of your code has a specific role.\n\nHere's how you might structure your code:\n\n```python\n# utility.py\n\ndef create_folder_if_not_exists(folder_path):\n    import os\n    if not os.path.exists(folder_path):\n        os.makedirs(folder_path)\n\n\n# upgrader.py\n\nfrom utility import create_folder_if_not_exists\n\nclass SoftwareUpgrader:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # class initialization\n        pass\n\n    def some_method(self):\n        # method that uses the helper function\n        create_folder_if_not_exists('/path/to/folder')\n        # other method logic\n```\n\nThis way, your helper function is reusable and your class methods remain focused on class-specific functionality."
