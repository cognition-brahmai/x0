Is there a more convenient way to set these fields using the human-readable name instead of the value? Here's an example of my model:\n\n```python\nclass Thing(models.Model):\n    PRIORITIES = (\n        (0, 'Low'),\n        (1, 'Normal'),\n        (2, 'High'),\n    )\n\n    priority = models.IntegerField(default=0, choices=PRIORITIES)\n```\n\nI want to set the priority of a Thing instance. However, this doesn't work:\n\n```python\nthing.priority = 'Normal'  # Throws ValueError on .save()\n```\n\nI currently have a workaround which is:\n\n```python\nthing.priority = dict((key,value) for (value,key) in Thing.PRIORITIES)['Normal']\n```\n\nBut this is not ideal. I was wondering if there is a better solution or a method to set fields by choice name that I may have overlooked?"

        "content": "In Django, when you have a model field with choices, you're typically expected to set the field value using the actual value (e.g., the integer in your case), not the human-readable name. However, you can make things more convenient by defining a helper method or a property in your model to handle this conversion for you.\n\nHere's one approach: You can create a method in your model that allows setting the priority using the human-readable name:\n\n```python\nclass Thing(models.Model):\n    PRIORITIES = (\n        (0, 'Low'),\n        (1, 'Normal'),\n        (2, 'High'),\n    )\n\n    priority = models.IntegerField(default=0, choices=PRIORITIES)\n\n    def set_priority_by_name(self, name):\n        priority_dict = dict((name, value) for (value, name) in self.PRIORITIES)\n        if name in priority_dict:\n            self.priority = priority_dict[name]\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Invalid priority name: {name}\")\n\n# Usage:\nthing = Thing()\nthing.set_priority_by_name('Normal')\nthing.save()\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use a class method to achieve the same functionality:\n\n```python\nclass Thing(models.Model):\n    PRIORITIES = (\n        (0, 'Low'),\n        (1, 'Normal'),\n        (2, 'High'),\n    )\n\n    priority = models.IntegerField(default=0, choices=PRIORITIES)\n\n    @classmethod\n    def get_priority_value(cls, name):\n        priority_dict = dict((name, value) for (value, name) in cls.PRIORITIES)\n        if name in priority_dict:\n            return priority_dict[name]\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Invalid priority name: {name}\")\n\n# Usage:\nthing = Thing()\nthing.priority = Thing.get_priority_value('Normal')\nthing.save()\n```\n\nThese methods make your code cleaner and easier to use, especially when you need to set the priority based on the human-readable name multiple times. This way, you encapsulate the logic for translating the human-readable name into the corresponding integer value within your model."
