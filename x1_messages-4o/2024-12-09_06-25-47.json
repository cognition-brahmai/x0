        "content": "In TensorFlow, when working with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks, the input data dimensions are structured as [Batch Size, Sequence Length, Input Dimension]. Let's break down these terms:\n\n1. **Sequence Length**: This refers to the number of time steps in each sequence of your input data. In the context of time-series data, it represents how many time steps you are looking back in the past for making predictions. If you are working with sequences where each sequence has a fixed number of elements, the sequence length would be the number of these elements.\n\n2. **Input Dimension**: This refers to the number of features in each time step of the sequence. Each element in your sequence is expected to have a certain number of features. For example, if each time step in your data has multiple variables (like temperature, pressure, etc.), the input dimension would be the count of these variables.\n\nFor your specific input data, `[[[1.23], [2.24], [5.68], [9.54], [6.90], [7.74], [3.26]]]`, here is how you would determine these parameters:\n\n- **Batch Size**: This is the number of sequences you process at a time. In your example, you have one outermost list, indicating a batch size of 1.\n\n- **Sequence Length**: This is the number of time steps in each sequence. In your example, there are 7 inner lists (each containing a list with a single number), so the sequence length is 7.\n\n- **Input Dimension**: This is the number of features per time step. In your example, each time step contains a single feature (a single number), so the input dimension is 1.\n\nIn summary, for your input data, the dimensions would be [Batch Size=1, Sequence Length=7, Input Dimension=1]. When feeding this data into an LSTM layer in TensorFlow, you would ensure your input data is shaped accordingly to match these dimensions."
