        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this using Python's `os` module along with `os.walk()` to traverse the directory tree. Here's a sample code that retrieves all files with a specific extension from a given directory and its subdirectories:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef find_files_with_extension(directory, extension):\n    matching_files = []\n    \n    # Use os.walk to traverse the directory and its subdirectories\n    for root, _, files in os.walk(directory):\n        # Check each file in the current directory\n        for file in files:\n            # If the file ends with the specified extension, add it to the list\n            if file.endswith(extension):\n                # Append the full path of the file\n                matching_files.append(os.path.join(root, file))\n    \n    return matching_files\n\n# Define the directory and the extension you want to search for\ndirectory = \"/home/user/documents\"\nextension = \".pdf\"\n\n# Get the list of matching files\npdf_files = find_files_with_extension(directory, extension)\n\n# Print the list of PDF files\nfor file_path in pdf_files:\n    print(file_path)\n```\n\n### How it Works:\n- The `os.walk()` function is used to generate the file names in a directory tree by walking either top-down or bottom-up.\n- For each directory, it returns a tuple containing the directory path (`root`), the directory names (`_`), and the file names (`files`).\n- The code checks each file to see if it ends with the specified extension.\n- If a file matches, its full path is added to the `matching_files` list.\n\nYou can adjust the `directory` and `extension` variables to fit your specific needs. This script will print the full paths of all matching files."
