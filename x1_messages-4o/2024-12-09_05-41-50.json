        "content": "To determine the Python version used to compile a `.pyc` file, you can inspect the \"magic number\" in the file. The magic number is a two-byte value located at the beginning of the `.pyc` file, and it indicates the version of Python that compiled the file.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to help you determine the version:\n\n1. **Open the `.pyc` file**: You can use a binary or hex editor to open the `.pyc` file and examine its contents.\n\n2. **Read the magic number**: The first four bytes of the `.pyc` file contain the magic number. The first two bytes are the actual magic number, and the next two bytes are a timestamp or other metadata.\n\n3. **Convert the magic number to an integer**: The magic number is stored in little-endian format, so you need to reverse the byte order before converting it to an integer.\n\n4. **Look up the magic number**: Once you have the integer representation of the magic number, you can compare it against a list of known magic numbers for different Python versions.\n\nHere's a Python script to help automate this process:\n\n```python\nimport importlib.util\nimport struct\n\ndef get_python_version_from_pyc(file_path):\n    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:\n        magic_number = f.read(2)\n        magic_number = struct.unpack('<H', magic_number)[0]\n\n    # A dictionary mapping magic numbers to Python versions\n    magic_number_to_version = {\n        20121: '1.5',\n        50428: '1.6',\n        50823: '2.0',\n        60202: '2.1',\n        60717: '2.2',\n        62011: '2.3',\n        62041: '2.4',\n        62061: '2.5',\n        62131: '2.6',\n        62161: '2.7',\n        62211: '3.0',\n        62251: '3.1',\n        62331: '3.2',\n        62021: '3.3',\n        3350: '3.4',\n        3360: '3.5',\n        3370: '3.6',\n        3390: '3.7',\n        3410: '3.8',\n        3430: '3.9',\n        3450: '3.10',\n    }\n\n    return magic_number_to_version.get(magic_number, \"Unknown version\")\n\n# Example usage\nfile_path = 'your_file.pyc'\nversion = get_python_version_from_pyc(file_path)\nprint(f\"The .pyc file was compiled with Python version: {version}\")\n```\n\nReplace `'your_file.pyc'` with the path to your `.pyc` file. This script will output the Python version used to compile the file. Note that the dictionary `magic_number_to_version` may need to be updated with newer Python versions if they are released after the script was created."
