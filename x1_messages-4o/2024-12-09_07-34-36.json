I am trying to fetch a page using Python 2.6 with the following code:\n\n```python\nimport urllib2\nurl = \"http://google.com\"\ndata = urllib2.urlopen(url)\ndata = data.read()\n```\nBut when I use this on a failing URL, I get the exception `urllib2.HTTPError: HTTP Error 500: Internal Server Error`. I want to know how I can fetch such error pages (with or without `urllib2`), even when they are returning Internal Server Errors. Also, note that with Python 3, the corresponding exception is `urllib.error.HTTPError`."

        "content": "To handle HTTP errors and still be able to read the response content in Python 2.6, you can catch the `urllib2.HTTPError` exception and access its content. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport urllib2\n\nurl = \"http://your-failing-url.com\"\n\ntry:\n    response = urllib2.urlopen(url)\n    html = response.read()\nexcept urllib2.HTTPError as e:\n    # This block will handle HTTPError exceptions\n    if e.code == 500:\n        print(\"HTTP Error 500 encountered. Reading response content.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"HTTP Error {e.code} encountered. Reading response content.\")\n    html = e.read()  # Read the response content from the exception\nexcept urllib2.URLError as e:\n    # This block will handle URL-related errors\n    print(f\"URL Error encountered: {e.reason}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Request successful.\")\n\nprint(html)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Try-Except Block**: The `try` block attempts to open the URL. If an `HTTPError` occurs, the code moves to the corresponding `except` block.\n- **HTTPError Handling**: When an `HTTPError` is caught, you can read the response content using the `read()` method on the exception object itself (`e.read()`).\n- **URLError Handling**: In case of URL-related errors (such as connection issues), you can catch them using `urllib2.URLError`.\n- **Print the Content**: Finally, you print the HTML content whether or not an error occurred.\n\nThis method allows you to handle HTTP errors gracefully while still accessing the response content. Remember that the response content might not always be HTML; it could also be a JSON error message or plain text. Adjust your content handling accordingly."
