        "content": "I am trying to understand the `axis` parameter in keras `BatchNormalization` layer. The keras documentation mentions that it uses `axis=-1` as a default value and states that the feature axis is typically normalized, and I am finding it surprising as I am more familiar with using something like `StandardScaler` from `sklearn`, which would be equivalent to using `axis=0`. This would normalize the features individually. So, why does keras normalize samples individually by default (i.e. `axis=-1`) as opposed to features? \n\nTo provide more context, let's consider a mock dataset:\n\n```python\ndata = np.array([[   1,   10,  100, 1000],\n                 [   2,   20,  200, 2000],\n                 [   3,   30,  300, 3000]])\n\ndata.mean(axis=0)\n# output: array([    2.,    20.,   200.,  2000.])\n\ndata.mean(axis=1)\n# output: array([ 277.75,  555.5 ,  833.25])\n```\nIn this case, wouldn't it make more sense to subtract the `axis=0` mean, as opposed to the `axis=1` mean? Using `axis=1`, the units and scales can be completely different. \n\nFurthermore, according to this paper, it seems to imply that `axis=0` should be used for calculating expectations and variances for each feature individually, assuming you have an (m, n) shaped dataset where m is the number of samples and n is the number of features.\n\nLastly, to test my understanding,  I experimented with a toy dataset and tried to inspect the dimensions of the means and variances `BatchNormalization` was calculating:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\nfrom keras.optimizers import Adam\nfrom keras.models import Model\nfrom keras.layers import BatchNormalization, Dense, Input\n\niris = load_iris()\nX = iris.data\ny = pd.get_dummies(iris.target).values\n\ninput_ = Input(shape=(4, ))\nnorm = BatchNormalization()(input_)\nl1 = Dense(4, activation='relu')(norm)\noutput = Dense(3, activation='sigmoid')(l1)\n\nmodel = Model(input_, output)\nmodel.compile(Adam(0.01), 'categorical_crossentropy')\nmodel.fit(X, y, epochs=100, batch_size=32)\n\nbn = model.layers[1]\nbn.moving_mean  # <tf.Variable 'batch_normalization_1/moving_mean:0' shape=(4,) dtype=float32_ref>\n```\nThe input X has shape (150, 4), and the `BatchNormalization` layer calculated 4 means, which means it operated over `axis=0`. But, if `BatchNormalization` has a default of `axis=-1` then shouldn't there be 150 means?"

        "content": "The confusion here arises from the difference in interpretation between feature normalization in a machine learning context and the workings of the `BatchNormalization` layer in neural networks. Let's clarify this:\n\n1. **Axis in BatchNormalization**: The `axis` parameter in Keras's `BatchNormalization` layer specifies the axis that should be normalized. By default, `axis=-1` means that the normalization is applied to the last axis of the input data. This means that each feature (or channel in the case of convolutional layers) is normalized across the batch independently. So, for a typical 2D input (batch_size, features), `axis=-1` directly corresponds to normalizing each feature across the batch.\n\n2. **Difference from StandardScaler**: The `StandardScaler` from `sklearn`, on the other hand, normalizes each feature across the samples in the entire dataset, not batch-wise. It effectively operates over `axis=0` in the context of a static dataset, meaning it looks at each feature and normalizes it based on the entire dataset's statistics.\n\n3. **Why Batch Normalization Uses Axis -1**: In the context of neural networks, `BatchNormalization` is designed to normalize the activations of each layer. This normalization happens during training, and it uses the statistics of the mini-batches (not the entire dataset) to calculate mean and variance. This is beneficial because it helps stabilize and speed up the training process by reducing internal covariate shift.\n\n4. **Understanding Your Toy Dataset Example**: In your example, you're feeding the model batches of data with a shape of (batch_size, features). The `BatchNormalization` layer computes the mean and variance for each feature across the batch. Since your input shape is (150, 4), and assuming the batch size is 32, the normalization occurs on the features (4) across each batch, not the 150 samples.\n\n5. **Moving Mean and Variance**: The `moving_mean` and `moving_variance` calculated by the `BatchNormalization` layer are running averages of the batch-wise statistics. These are updated during training and used during inference to standardize the activations.\n\nUltimately, the BatchNormalization layer's `axis=-1` default setting is appropriate for normalizing feature maps in neural network layers, where each feature is treated independently across samples in a batch. This is conceptually different from the way `StandardScaler` operates on a dataset level."
