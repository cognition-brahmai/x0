        "content": "To compare two lists in Python and return the values that match in both, you can use a simple function that utilizes list comprehension or set intersection. Below are two different approaches to achieve this:\n\n### Approach 1: Using List Comprehension\n\nYou can use list comprehension to iterate over one list and check if each element is in the other list:\n\n```python\ndef returnMatches(list1, list2):\n    return [item for item in list1 if item in list2]\n\na = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nb = [9, 8, 7, 6, 5]\nmatches = returnMatches(a, b)\nprint(matches)  # Output: [5]\n```\n\n### Approach 2: Using Set Intersection\n\nYou can convert both lists to sets and use the intersection operation to find common elements. This is often more efficient for larger lists:\n\n```python\ndef returnMatches(list1, list2):\n    return list(set(list1) & set(list2))\n\na = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nb = [9, 8, 7, 6, 5]\nmatches = returnMatches(a, b)\nprint(matches)  # Output: [5]\n```\n\nBoth methods will give you the list of matching elements. The set-based approach is generally faster when dealing with large lists due to the efficiency of set operations."
