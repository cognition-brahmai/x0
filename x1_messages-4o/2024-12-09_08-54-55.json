        "content": "To write a JavaScript program that prints the numbers between 1 and 5, you can use a simple `for` loop. Here is a basic example:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {\n    console.log(i);\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Initialization (`let i = 1;`)**: This part initializes a variable `i` to 1, which is the starting point of our loop.\n\n- **Condition (`i <= 5;`)**: This condition is checked before each iteration of the loop. The loop will continue to execute as long as this condition is true. In this case, the loop will run while `i` is less than or equal to 5.\n\n- **Increment (`i++`)**: After each iteration, the `i++` statement increases the value of `i` by 1.\n\n- **`console.log(i);`**: This line of code inside the loop prints the current value of `i` to the console.\n\nWhen you run this program, it will output the numbers 1 through 5, each on a new line."
