The code I'm using is as follows:\n\n```python\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimgpath = './map.png'\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.image as mpimg\nimport numpy as np\n\nfrom PIL import Image\n\nimg = Image.open(imgpath)\nprint(img.size)\n\nwidth, height = img.size\nimgplot = plt.imshow(img)\nplt.savefig('test.png', dpi = 300)\n```\nAlthough the `plt.savefig('test.png', dpi = 300)` command produces a high-resolution image (because I changed the dpi to 300), the image displayed in the notebook is of such low resolution that I can't identify anything on it. I tried using `plt.imshow(img, dpi = 300)`, but it doesn't work. Is there a way to increase the resolution of the image shown in the Jupyter Notebook?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is that the `imshow` function in Matplotlib does not have a `dpi` parameter to directly increase the resolution of the image displayed in the notebook. However, you can increase the size of the displayed image by adjusting the figure size. This won't change the DPI of the image displayed, but it will make the image appear larger and potentially easier to see details.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to increase the size of the image displayed in the notebook:\n\n```python\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimgpath = './map.png'\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.image as mpimg\nimport numpy as np\n\nfrom PIL import Image\n\nimg = Image.open(imgpath)\nprint(img.size)\n\nwidth, height = img.size\n\n# Create a figure and set its size\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 10))  # Adjust the figsize as needed\n\nimgplot = ax.imshow(img)\nplt.axis('off')  # Optionally turn off the axis\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nBy adjusting the `figsize` parameter, you can control how large the image appears in the notebook. The values `(10, 10)` are just an example; you can modify them to fit your needs.\n\nIf you want to ensure that the image is displayed at its native resolution, you can use the following approach:\n\n```python\nimport IPython.display as display\nfrom PIL import Image\n\nimg = Image.open(imgpath)\ndisplay.display(img)\n```\n\nThis will use the native image display capabilities of the Jupyter Notebook, which can often render images at a higher resolution compared to Matplotlib's `imshow`."
