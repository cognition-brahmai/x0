I have previously made calls using the `urllib2` module and have also looked into the `requests` module but I am unsure of how to proceed. The command line equivalent of what I am trying to achieve is: \n```curl --header \"Authorization:access_token myToken\" https://website.example/id```\nThis gives JSON output and `myToken` is a hexadecimal variable that remains constant throughout. I would like to be able to make this call from Python so I can loop through different ids and analyze the output."

        "content": "To make an API query using Python with authentication via an access token, you can use the `requests` module, which is simpler and more straightforward than `urllib2`. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to proceed:\n\n1. **Install the Requests Module**: If you haven't already installed the `requests` module, you can do so using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n\n2. **Use the Requests Module to Make an API Call**: You can use the `requests.get()` function to make a GET request to your desired URL. You will need to include the access token in the headers to authenticate your request. Here's how you can do it:\n\n   ```python\n   import requests\n\n   # Define the base URL and access token\n   base_url = \"https://website.example/id\"\n   access_token = \"myToken\"\n\n   # Prepare the headers with the access token\n   headers = {\n       \"Authorization\": f\"access_token {access_token}\"\n   }\n\n   # Make the API request\n   response = requests.get(base_url, headers=headers)\n\n   # Check if the request was successful\n   if response.status_code == 200:\n       # Parse the JSON response\n       data = response.json()\n       print(data)\n   else:\n       # Print the error message\n       print(f\"Failed to retrieve data: {response.status_code} - {response.text}\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Loop Through Different IDs**: If you want to loop through different IDs, you can modify the `base_url` by appending each ID to it in a loop. Here's an example:\n\n   ```python\n   import requests\n\n   # Define the base URL and access token\n   base_url = \"https://website.example/\"\n   access_token = \"myToken\"\n\n   # Prepare the headers with the access token\n   headers = {\n       \"Authorization\": f\"access_token {access_token}\"\n   }\n\n   # List of IDs to loop through\n   ids_to_check = [\"id1\", \"id2\", \"id3\"]\n\n   for id in ids_to_check:\n       # Construct the full URL for each ID\n       url = f\"{base_url}{id}\"\n       \n       # Make the API request\n       response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n\n       # Check if the request was successful\n       if response.status_code == 200:\n           # Parse the JSON response\n           data = response.json()\n           print(f\"Data for {id}: {data}\")\n       else:\n           # Print the error message\n           print(f\"Failed to retrieve data for {id}: {response.status_code} - {response.text}\")\n   ```\n\nThis setup will loop through each ID, make a request to the API, and print the data or error message for each ID. Adjust the `ids_to_check` list to include the IDs you wish to query."
