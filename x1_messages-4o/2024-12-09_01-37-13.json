        "content": "I have defined a class in Python called 'Foo'. In this class, I have a method '__bool__' which should return 'True' if the attribute 'bar' is greater than 10, otherwise 'False'. But when I create an object of this class and use it in an 'if' statement, it is not behaving as expected. The 'if' statement seems to always evaluate to 'True', regardless of the value of 'bar'. Here is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nclass Foo(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.bar = 3\n    def __bool__(self):\n        return self.bar > 10\n\nfoo = Foo()\n\nif foo:\n    print 'x'\nelse:\n    print 'y'\n```\nThe output of this code is 'x', but I expected it to be 'y' because 'bar' is not greater than 10. Why is this happening?"

        "content": "The issue you are encountering is due to the difference in how the `__bool__` method is implemented in Python 3 versus Python 2, and also a typo in your print statement that suggests you might be using Python 2. \n\nIn Python 2, the method you need to implement for boolean conversion is `__nonzero__` instead of `__bool__`. The `__bool__` method is used in Python 3. If you are using Python 2, your class should look like this:\n\n```python\nclass Foo(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.bar = 3\n    def __nonzero__(self):\n        return self.bar > 10\n\nfoo = Foo()\n\nif foo:\n    print 'x'\nelse:\n    print 'y'\n```\n\nIf you're using Python 3, your code should be correct with `__bool__`, but the print statement should use parentheses, like this:\n\n```python\nclass Foo(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.bar = 3\n    def __bool__(self):\n        return self.bar > 10\n\nfoo = Foo()\n\nif foo:\n    print('x')\nelse:\n    print('y')\n```\n\nMake sure you're using the correct version of Python and the appropriate method for that version. If you're using Python 2, use `__nonzero__`; if using Python 3, use `__bool__`. Also, ensure your print statements match the syntax of the version you're using."
