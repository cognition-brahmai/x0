The marbles can be distributed equally between his two kids, meaning the number of marbles must be an even number.\n3. The remainder conditions that were mentioned (but not specified in your question).\n\nAssuming the remainder conditions are something like having a specific remainder when divided by another number (as is common in such problems), let's work with a general approach.\n\nLet's say John also wants the marbles to meet some remainder condition, such as leaving a remainder of \\( r \\) when divided by \\( n \\). We need to minimize the number of marbles, \\( M \\), such that:\n\n- \\( M \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\) (multiple of 5)\n- \\( M \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2} \\) (even number)\n- \\( M \\equiv r \\pmod{n} \\)\n\nThe least common multiple of 5 and 2 is 10, so the number must be a multiple of 10. Thus, let's find the smallest \\( M \\) that satisfies the above conditions using the Chinese Remainder Theorem or direct checking:\n\n1. Set \\( M = 10k \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n2. Check for the smallest \\( k \\) such that \\( 10k \\equiv r \\pmod{n} \\).\n\nWithout the specific remainder condition (remainder \\( r \\) when divided by \\( n \\)), we can't determine the exact number. However, if you provide the specific remainder condition, I can help calculate the exact minimum number of marbles. If no such condition exists, and the problem is only about satisfying the first two conditions, the smallest number that is both a multiple of 5 and even is 10."
