Specifically, I have two counters, one being `Counter({'menu': 20, 'good': 15, 'happy': 10, 'bar': 5})` and the other `Counter({'menu': 1, 'good': 1, 'bar': 3})`. I am looking for a way to combine these two counters to get `Counter({'menu': 21, 'good': 16, 'happy': 10,'bar': 8})`."

        "content": "To sum the contents of two `collections.Counter` objects in Python, you can simply use the addition operator (`+`). When you add two `Counter` objects together, it combines their counts, summing the values for any keys that appear in both counters. \n\nHere's how you can do it with your specific example:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ncounter1 = Counter({'menu': 20, 'good': 15, 'happy': 10, 'bar': 5})\ncounter2 = Counter({'menu': 1, 'good': 1, 'bar': 3})\n\n# Sum the two Counter objects\ncombined_counter = counter1 + counter2\n\nprint(combined_counter)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nCounter({'menu': 21, 'good': 16, 'happy': 10, 'bar': 8})\n```\n\nThis method efficiently combines the counts from both counters, ensuring that keys present in both have their counts summed."
