Now, I would like to generate predictions using this model in the form of categorical outputs rather than probability matrices. However, when I use `predict(model, newdata, type='response')` I get probabilities similar to the results of `type='link'`. Is there a way to get categorical outputs? Here's the code I've been using:\n\n```r\nBST = gbm(V1~.,data=training,distribution='multinomial',n.trees=2000,interaction.depth=4,cv.folds=5,shrinkage=0.005)\npredBST = predict(BST,newdata=test,type='response')\n```"

        "content": "In your scenario, you want to convert the predicted probabilities into categorical outputs. The `predict` function with `type='response'` for a `gbm` model with `distribution='multinomial'` indeed returns a matrix of predicted probabilities for each class. To get the categorical predictions, you need to convert these probabilities into class labels by selecting the class with the highest probability for each observation.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```r\n# Assuming predBST is the matrix of predicted probabilities\n# Each row corresponds to an observation, and each column corresponds to a class\n\n# Get the index of the maximum probability for each observation\npredicted_classes_index <- apply(predBST, 1, which.max)\n\n# Map the indices to actual class labels\n# Assuming your response variable in the training data has levels like factor(V1)\nclass_labels <- levels(training$V1)\npredicted_classes <- class_labels[predicted_classes_index]\n\n# predicted_classes now contains the categorical predictions\n```\n\nThis code uses the `apply` function to find the index of the maximum probability for each row (observation) in your `predBST` matrix. The `which.max` function helps identify the column index with the highest probability, which corresponds to the predicted class. Finally, you map these indices to the actual class labels using the `levels` function from your training data's response variable.\n\nEnsure that your response variable in the training data is a factor with the correct levels, as this mapping relies on those levels to convert indices back to the original class labels."
