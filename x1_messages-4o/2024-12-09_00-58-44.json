I have implemented three approaches: Using the standard PyTorch MSE loss function (which works fine), creating a custom loss function but relying on PyTorch's automatic gradient calculation (which also works fine), and finally, creating a custom loss function with my own backward method (which is causing the problem). In the third approach, the training loss is increasing instead of decreasing. Could you help me understand what might be going wrong?"

        "content": "When implementing a custom backward function in PyTorch, it's crucial to ensure that the gradient calculations are accurate and stable. Here's a checklist to help identify potential issues:\n\n1. **Check Gradient Calculation**: Ensure that the gradients computed in your custom backward method are correct. For MSE loss, the gradient with respect to the predictions \\( \\hat{y} \\) is \\((\\hat{y} - y)\\), where \\( y \\) are the true values. Make sure you're calculating this gradient correctly.\n\n2. **Scale Gradients Properly**: Incorrect scaling of gradients can lead to exploding or vanishing gradients. Ensure that the calculated gradients are correctly scaled. For MSE, the typical gradient is divided by the number of samples.\n\n3. **Learning Rate**: An excessively high learning rate can cause the loss to explode. Try reducing the learning rate to see if the loss behaves more stably.\n\n4. **Gradient Accumulation**: Ensure that you're not accidentally accumulating gradients over iterations without resetting them. Use `optimizer.zero_grad()` before calling the backward function.\n\n5. **Parameter Update**: Verify that the parameters are being updated correctly using the gradients you've calculated. If you're manipulating the gradients directly, ensure that any operations are consistent with gradient descent.\n\n6. **Numerical Stability**: Check for any operations in your gradient computation that might be causing numerical instability, such as division by very small numbers.\n\n7. **Comparison with Autograd**: Compare your gradients with those computed by PyTorch's autograd to ensure they match. This can help identify discrepancies in your custom implementation.\n\n8. **Debugging**: Print intermediate values of gradients and loss during training to trace where things might be going wrong.\n\nIf you've checked all the above and still encounter issues, you might want to simplify the model or use smaller data initially to isolate the problem. Additionally, comparing your implementation against a simple working example can highlight differences."
