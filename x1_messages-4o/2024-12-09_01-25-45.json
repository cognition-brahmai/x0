For example, I have this piece of code:\n\n```python\nsession.query(Foo.bar.label(\"foobar\")).filter(foobar > 10).all()\n```\n\nHowever, it doesn't work as expected because there is no variable called 'foobar'. Can you guide me on how to accomplish this?"

        "content": "When you use the `label` method in SQLAlchemy, it creates an alias for a column in the result set, but you can't directly reference this alias in the query using Python variable syntax. Instead, you need to use the alias within the SQLAlchemy query syntax. Here\u2019s how you can modify your code to use the labeled element in a filter:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import aliased\n\n# Create a labeled element\nfoobar = Foo.bar.label(\"foobar\")\n\n# Use the labeled element in the query\nresults = session.query(foobar).filter(foobar > 10).all()\n```\n\nIn this example, `foobar` is assigned the labeled column, and you can use it in the query directly in the `filter` call. This way, you are using the labeled column for both selecting and filtering the data.\n\nIf you need to use the alias in more complex queries, consider using `aliased` or subqueries, but for simple labeling and filtering, the above approach should work well."
