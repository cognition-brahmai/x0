        "content": "The error you are encountering is due to the fact that the environment is trying to create a window for plotting using a display server, which is not available because you are running the script over SSH in a headless mode. The solution is to ensure that you are using a non-interactive backend to generate plots without needing a display server.\n\nYou've already set the backend to `'Agg'` using `matplotlib.use('Agg')`, which is correct for headless environments. However, you might still be experiencing issues due to other settings or imports. Here's a step-by-step guide to troubleshoot and resolve the problem:\n\n1. **Ensure Proper Backend**: Double-check that the backend is set to `'Agg'` before any other matplotlib imports. You can achieve this by placing `matplotlib.use('Agg')` right after importing matplotlib and before importing other modules that utilize matplotlib.\n\n2. **Check for Conflicting Imports**: Ensure that there are no other conflicting imports or configurations of matplotlib that might override your backend setting. This includes making sure that the backend setting is done before any import of `pylab` or `pyplot`.\n\n3. **Environment Variables**: Ensure that there are no environment variables like `DISPLAY` set in your environment that could be causing this issue. You can check this by running `echo $DISPLAY` in your shell. If it\u2019s set, try unsetting it using `unset DISPLAY`.\n\n4. **Reinstall Matplotlib**: If the problem persists, there might be an issue with your matplotlib installation. Consider reinstalling it using:\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall matplotlib\n   pip install matplotlib\n   ```\n\n5. **Script Execution**: Ensure that when you execute your script over SSH, you don't accidentally use any commands or options that might try to open a display, like `ssh -X`.\n\n6. **Check Anaconda Environment**: If you are using an Anaconda environment, ensure that all packages are up-to-date and compatible with each other. You can update your environment using:\n   ```bash\n   conda update --all\n   ```\n\n7. **Running a Simple Test**: Create a simple test script to ensure the basic functionality works:\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib\n   matplotlib.use('Agg')  # Ensure this is set before any other imports\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n   import numpy as np\n\n   x = np.arange(0, 2, 0.001)\n   y = np.sin(x)**2 + 4*np.cos(x)\n   plt.plot(x, y, 'r.')\n   plt.savefig('test_plot.png')  # Save the plot to a file\n   ```\n\n8. **Check for Errors**: If the simple test script works and your main script does not, the issue may be with other parts of your script. Start by commenting out parts of your script to isolate the problem.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the \"Invalid DISPLAY variable\" error and successfully run your script in a headless SSH environment."
