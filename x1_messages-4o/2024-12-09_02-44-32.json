        "content": "To modify the display text in a Django Admin `<select>` field for a `ForeignKey`, you can customize the queryset and use the `__str__` method of the model to display additional information. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Modify the `__str__` Method**: \n   Update the `__str__` method of the model you are referencing with the `ForeignKey` to include both its name and the name of its parent. This will ensure that whenever this object is represented as a string, it will show the desired information.\n\n   For example, consider a model `Child` with a ForeignKey to a model `Parent`:\n\n   ```python\n   class Parent(models.Model):\n       name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n\n       def __str__(self):\n           return self.name\n\n   class Child(models.Model):\n       parent = models.ForeignKey(Parent, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n       name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n\n       def __str__(self):\n           return f\"{self.name} ({self.parent.name})\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Use a Custom Form**:\n   If you want even more control over how the ForeignKey field is displayed, you can create a custom form for the admin interface.\n\n   ```python\n   from django import forms\n   from django.contrib import admin\n   from .models import Child\n\n   class ChildForm(forms.ModelForm):\n       class Meta:\n           model = Child\n           fields = '__all__'\n\n       def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n           super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n           # Customize the queryset and label for the ForeignKey field\n           self.fields['parent'].queryset = Parent.objects.all()\n           self.fields['parent'].label_from_instance = lambda obj: f\"{obj.name} (Parent: {obj.parent.name})\"\n\n   class ChildAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n       form = ChildForm\n\n   admin.site.register(Child, ChildAdmin)\n   ```\n\n3. **Override `label_from_instance`**:\n   In the custom form, we override the `label_from_instance` method for the `parent` field. This method is used to determine how each object in the queryset should be displayed in the dropdown.\n\nWith these steps, the `<select>` field in the Django Admin will display both the name of the `Child` and its `Parent`, providing more context to the user. Remember to adjust the model names and fields according to your specific use case."
