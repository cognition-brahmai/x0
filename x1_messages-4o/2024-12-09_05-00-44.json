        "content": "Yes, you can easily display an image upside down using the `imshow()` function from `matplotlib.pyplot`. One straightforward way to invert the image is to manipulate the data array before displaying it. You can achieve this by using NumPy to flip the array vertically. Here's an example of how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Assuming 'image' is your image data in a NumPy array\n# Flip the image upside down\ninverted_image = np.flipud(image)\n\n# Display the inverted image\nplt.imshow(inverted_image)\nplt.axis('off')  # Optional: To turn off the axis labels\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this code, `np.flipud()` is used to flip the image array upside down. The `imshow()` function then displays this inverted image. This approach is efficient and doesn't modify the original image data."
