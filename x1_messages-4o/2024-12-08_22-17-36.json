        "content": "### Biographical Sketch of Nikola Tesla\n\n#### Early Life and Education\n\nNikola Tesla was born on July 10, 1856, in Smiljan, a village in the Austrian Empire, present-day Croatia. He was the fourth of five children in the family of Milutin Tesla, a Serbian Orthodox priest, and Georgina \u0110uka Tesla, who was unschooled but had a talent for making home craft tools and memorizing many Serbian epic poems. Tesla credited his eidetic memory and creative abilities to his mother's genetics and influence.\n\nTesla attended the Polytechnic School in Graz, Austria, and later the University of Prague. Though he did not complete a degree, he was exceptionally knowledgeable about physics and mathematics, which laid the foundation for his future innovations.\n\n#### Contributions to Electrical Engineering and Physics\n\n1. **Alternating Current (AC) System**: Tesla's most significant contribution was the development and promotion of the alternating current (AC) system for power distribution, which became the standard for electricity transmission worldwide. AC was more efficient for long-distance transmission than the direct current (DC) system promoted by Thomas Edison.\n\n2. **Induction Motor and Transformers**: Tesla invented the induction motor and transformers, devices that utilize the principles of electromagnetism to convert electrical energy into mechanical energy and to change the voltage of electricity, respectively.\n\n3. **Tesla Coil**: The Tesla Coil, invented in 1891, is a high-voltage transformer circuit that creates high-frequency alternating currents, leading to many applications in radio technology and electrical experiments.\n\n4. **Wireless Communication**: Tesla envisioned wireless communication and power transmission. He conducted early experiments in wireless transmission, which laid the groundwork for modern radio and telecommunications.\n\n5. **Radio Waves**: Tesla's experiments with radio waves predated those of Guglielmo Marconi, although Marconi is credited with the invention of the radio. Tesla's work was later recognized when the U.S. Supreme Court acknowledged his patents related to the technology.\n\n6. **X-ray Technology**: Tesla's work on high-voltage and high-frequency power led to pioneering work in X-ray imaging, independently of Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen.\n\n#### Comparative Analysis with Contemporaries\n\n- **Thomas Edison**: Tesla and Edison had contrasting scientific philosophies and professional approaches. Edison was a proponent of direct current (DC), while Tesla championed alternating current (AC). The \"War of Currents\" was primarily a battle between Edison's DC systems and Tesla's AC systems, backed by George Westinghouse. Tesla's AC eventually prevailed due to its efficiency over long distances.\n\n- **George Westinghouse**: Westinghouse was an industrialist who recognized the potential of Tesla's AC system and partnered with him to develop and commercialize it. Their collaboration led to the eventual dominance of AC power, particularly after the successful lighting of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago and the harnessing of Niagara Falls for power generation.\n\n#### Personal Life\n\nTesla led a largely solitary and celibate life, dedicating himself wholly to his work and innovations. He was known for his meticulous routines and eccentric behavior, such as his obsession with the number three and his aversion to pearls. Despite his scientific brilliance, he struggled with financial issues throughout his life, often due to his lack of business acumen and the overshadowing of his inventions by rivals.\n\nTesla never married, often claiming that his chastity was helpful to his scientific abilities. He had close friendships with figures like Mark Twain, who admired his intellect and creativity.\n\n#### Later Years and Legacy\n\nIn his later years, Tesla continued to work on various projects, including ideas for renewable energy and wireless power distribution, but many of his concepts remained theoretical. He died on January 7, 1943, in New York City, poor and reclusive.\n\nDespite his financial and personal struggles, Tesla's legacy is monumental. His work laid the foundation for modern electrical engineering and power distribution systems. Today, he is celebrated as a pioneer of electrical engineering, a visionary whose ideas were ahead of his time, and a symbol of the inventive spirit. His name lives on in the Tesla, the SI unit of magnetic flux density, and in the electric vehicle company Tesla, Inc."
