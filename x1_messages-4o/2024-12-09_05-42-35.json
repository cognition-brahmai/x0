I've attempted to set the 'tzinfo' attribute of the datetime object directly using the code:\n\n```python\nclass Book( db.Model ):\n    creationTime = db.DateTimeProperty()\n\nbook.creationTime.tzinfo = EST\n```\nI referenced this example for my EST object. However, I'm encountering an error message that says \"attribute 'tzinfo' of 'datetime.datetime' objects is not writable\". I've seen answers that recommend using libraries such as pytz and python-dateutil, but I want to understand how to solve this problem without them. How can I set the timezone of a datetime instance in Python?"

        "content": "In Python, the `datetime` object's `tzinfo` attribute is indeed not directly writable. Instead, you should use methods that return a new datetime object with the desired timezone information. While using libraries like `pytz` would typically be the most straightforward approach, it's possible to handle timezone conversion without third-party libraries by using the built-in `datetime` module.\n\nSince you're not using external libraries, you can manually adjust the time to account for the timezone difference. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Determine the time difference between UTC and EST. Note that EST is UTC-5 hours (without daylight saving time).\n\n2. Adjust the `creationTime` to reflect this difference.\n\nHere's an example of how you can manually adjust the datetime:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\nclass Book:\n    def __init__(self, creationTime):\n        self.creationTime = creationTime\n\n    def convert_to_est(self):\n        # EST is UTC-5\n        est_offset = timedelta(hours=-5)\n        # Adjust the time\n        est_time = self.creationTime + est_offset\n        return est_time\n\n# Example usage\nbook = Book(datetime(2023, 10, 31, 12, 0, 0))  # Example UTC datetime\nest_time = book.convert_to_est()\nprint(\"Original UTC Time:\", book.creationTime)\nprint(\"Converted EST Time:\", est_time)\n```\n\nThis example manually adjusts the UTC time to EST by subtracting 5 hours. Remember that this approach doesn't handle daylight saving time, which would require additional logic or a timezone-aware library to manage correctly. If you need to handle daylight saving time transitions, using a library like `pytz` is recommended."
