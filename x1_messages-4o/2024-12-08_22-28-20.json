Since there is an even number of observations, the median will be the average of the two middle numbers.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Median} = \\frac{2 + 3}{2} = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\n\\]\n\n### R Code:\n\nHere is how you can compute the mean and median in R:\n\n```r\n# Dataset\ndata <- c(2, 3, 7, 1)\n\n# Mean\nmean_value <- mean(data)\nmean_value\n\n# Median\nmedian_value <- median(data)\nmedian_value\n```\n\n### LaTeX Code:\n\nHere is the LaTeX code to display the mean and median calculations:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\textbf{Mean:}\n\n\\[\n\\text{Mean} = \\frac{2 + 3 + 7 + 1}{4} = \\frac{13}{4} = 3.25\n\\]\n\n\\textbf{Median:}\n\nFirst, arrange the numbers in ascending order: 1, 2, 3, 7.\n\nSince there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle numbers:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Median} = \\frac{2 + 3}{2} = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\n\\]\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nFeel free to use this R code to calculate the values, and the LaTeX code to display the calculations in a document."
