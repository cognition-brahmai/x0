I followed NVIDIA instructions and installed the CUDA toolkit for Ubuntu Linux 10.04, GPU Computing SDK code samples and Developer Drivers for Linux (260.19.26) (64 bit), as my system is 64 bit. I downloaded everything from http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cuda_3_2_downloads.html#Linux. I added /usr/local/cuda/bin to PATH and /usr/local/cuda/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH as per the installation package instructions. However, when I try to run the sample programs, some of them run successfully while others don't. For example, 'convolutionSeparable' and 'matrixMul' just stop without any error message. On the other hand, programs like 'clock', 'simpleMultiCopy', 'MonteCarlo', 'simpleZeroCopy' output 'PASSED'. 'bandwidthTest' just stops with a blinking cursor. How can I ensure my CUDA installation is successful? What could possibly be wrong with the programs that don't run?"

        "content": "To verify that your CUDA installation is successful and troubleshoot issues with specific programs, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check CUDA Version**: First, verify that your system recognizes the CUDA installation. Run the command:\n   ```bash\n   nvcc --version\n   ```\n   This should display the CUDA version you have installed. If it doesn't, there might be an issue with your PATH settings.\n\n2. **Verify NVIDIA Driver Installation**: Ensure that your NVIDIA driver is correctly installed and is compatible with your CUDA version. You can check the driver version with:\n   ```bash\n   nvidia-smi\n   ```\n   This should display the driver version and other details about your GPU.\n\n3. **Check Environment Variables**: Double-check that your `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables are correctly set. You can do this by running:\n   ```bash\n   echo $PATH\n   echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n   ```\n   Ensure that `/usr/local/cuda/bin` is in your `PATH` and `/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/lib` is in your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.\n\n4. **Test Device Query**: Run the `deviceQuery` sample, which is usually located in the `~/NVIDIA_CUDA-<version>/samples/1_Utilities/deviceQuery` directory:\n   ```bash\n   ./deviceQuery\n   ```\n   If this passes, it means your GPU is being detected correctly and the CUDA installation is likely successful.\n\n5. **Check for Specific Errors**: If specific programs like `convolutionSeparable` and `matrixMul` do not run, try running them with `cuda-gdb` to identify any errors:\n   ```bash\n   cuda-gdb ./convolutionSeparable\n   run\n   ```\n   This can help identify any specific issues or errors occurring during execution.\n\n6. **Check System Resources**: Ensure that your system has enough resources (memory, processing power) to run these computations, as resource constraints can sometimes cause programs to halt unexpectedly.\n\n7. **Review Sample Code**: Sometimes, issues might be related to specific sample code. Ensure that the code is correct and has not been modified accidentally.\n\n8. **Consult Logs and Documentation**: Check system logs (`dmesg` or `/var/log/syslog`) for possible kernel errors or warnings. Also, refer to the CUDA documentation for any known issues or additional troubleshooting steps specific to CUDA version 3.2.\n\n9. **Update and Compatibility**: Consider updating to a more recent version of Ubuntu and CUDA if feasible, as Ubuntu 10.04 is quite outdated, and newer versions might offer better support and bug fixes.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and resolve issues with your CUDA installation and ensure it is working correctly."
