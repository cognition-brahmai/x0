I have tried using the 'subprocess.Popen' method with 'nohup' and 'my_command' but it only works if the parent script exits gracefully. If I kill the script using Ctrl-C, all child processes are killed too. The platforms that I am using are OS X and Linux, with Python 2.6 and Python 2.7. Is there a way to avoid this?\n\nHere is the code that I used:\n\n```python\nsubprocess.Popen(['nohup', 'my_command'],\n                 stdout=open('/dev/null', 'w'),\n                 stderr=open('logfile.log', 'a'))\n```"

        "content": "When you want to run a process from Python that continues to run even after the parent script is terminated, you need to ensure that the child process is fully detached from the parent. The issue you're facing with `Ctrl-C` terminating the child process along with the parent is due to the fact that the child process is still part of the same process group.\n\nTo fully detach the child process, you can use the `setsid` option in the `subprocess.Popen` call. This creates a new session and sets the child process as the leader of that session, effectively detaching it from the parent process group. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport subprocess\n\n# Open the stdout and stderr to files\nstdout_file = open('/dev/null', 'w')\nstderr_file = open('logfile.log', 'a')\n\n# Run the command with setsid to detach it\np = subprocess.Popen(\n    ['nohup', 'my_command'],\n    stdout=stdout_file,\n    stderr=stderr_file,\n    preexec_fn=os.setsid  # This sets the session ID and detaches the process\n)\n\n# Close the file descriptors in the parent process\nstdout_file.close()\nstderr_file.close()\n```\n\nHere's what's happening in this code:\n\n- `preexec_fn=os.setsid`: This is a function that will be called in the child process just before the command is executed. `os.setsid()` creates a new session and sets the child process as the session leader, fully detaching it from the parent.\n- The `stdout` and `stderr` are redirected to `/dev/null` and `logfile.log`, respectively, to ensure they don't depend on the parent terminal.\n- Make sure to close the file descriptors in the parent process to avoid resource leaks.\n\nBy using `os.setsid`, the child process will not receive any signals sent to the parent process group (like those sent by pressing `Ctrl-C`), and it will continue running independently."
