We are now planning to offer a \"local\" version of our system, which will be running on PCs that are physically owned by our users. We want to safeguard the app from potential copying and reverse-engineering as much as possible. I am considering using Docker as a deployment tool. Is it feasible to create encrypted Docker containers that prevent anyone from accessing the data stored in the container's filesystem? Are there any established solutions to this problem? Alternatively, are there any well-known solutions not based on Docker?"

        "content": "Deploying applications securely on user-owned PCs is a challenging task, especially when it comes to preventing copying and reverse-engineering. Here are some considerations and potential solutions for safeguarding your application:\n\n### Using Docker for Deployment\n\n1. **Docker Image Security**: Docker does not natively support encrypted containers. However, you can take the following steps to increase security:\n   - **Minimize Image Layers**: Keep the number of layers in your Docker image to a minimum, and avoid including unnecessary files or tools that could aid in reverse-engineering.\n   - **Use Multi-Stage Builds**: This allows you to keep your final image clean and free from build tools or source code that are not needed at runtime.\n   - **Obfuscate Code**: For your Python code, consider using obfuscation tools to make reverse-engineering more difficult.\n   - **Docker Secrets**: Use Docker secrets to manage sensitive data like API keys or configuration files securely.\n\n2. **Encrypted Filesystems**: While Docker itself does not encrypt filesystems, you can use an encrypted filesystem on the host machine to store Docker data. This adds a layer of security but requires that the host machine is secured properly.\n\n3. **Runtime Security**: Use Docker Security features like user namespaces, seccomp, and AppArmor profiles to limit the capabilities of the container.\n\n### Alternative Solutions\n\n1. **Virtual Machines (VMs)**: Deploying your application inside a virtual machine can provide a stronger isolation boundary than Docker containers. You can encrypt the VM disk images to protect your data.\n\n2. **Application Hardening**:\n   - **Code Obfuscation**: Use obfuscation tools for both your C binaries and Python code to make reverse-engineering more challenging.\n   - **Code Signing**: Sign your binaries and scripts to ensure that they have not been tampered with.\n   - **Binary Packing**: Use binary packers to compress and encrypt your C binaries.\n\n3. **License Management**: Implement a robust licensing mechanism that ties the application to a specific machine or user account. This can involve:\n   - **Hardware Binding**: Bind your license to hardware attributes of the user's PC.\n   - **Periodic License Verification**: Require periodic verification of the license with a central server.\n\n4. **Remote Attestation**: Use techniques like remote attestation to verify the integrity and authenticity of the application environment before execution.\n\n5. **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)**: If applicable, leverage TEEs available on modern CPUs (e.g., Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone) to protect sensitive parts of your application.\n\n### Considerations\n\n- **Trade-offs**: Increased security often comes with trade-offs in terms of performance, complexity, and user experience. It is important to balance these factors based on your threat model.\n- **Legal Protections**: Consider the legal protections available, such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights, and ensure your users agree to terms of service that prohibit reverse-engineering.\n\nIn summary, while Docker can be a part of your deployment strategy, it should be complemented with other security measures to provide comprehensive protection against copying and reverse-engineering."
