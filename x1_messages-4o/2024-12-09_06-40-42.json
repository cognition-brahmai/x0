Currently, my code looks like this:\n\n```python\nclass Tag(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'tag'\n\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n    label = Column(String)\n\n    def __init__(self, label, parentTag=None):\n        self.label = label\n```\nI'm unsure how to add the \"parent\" relationship. Could you guide me on this?"

        "content": "To create a self-referential relationship in SQLAlchemy where each `Tag` can have a parent that is another `Tag`, you need to add a foreign key column pointing to the `id` of the `Tag` itself and establish a relationship using the `relationship()` function. Here's how you can modify your `Tag` class to include the parent-child relationship:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, ForeignKey\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import relationship, backref\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\n\nBase = declarative_base()\n\nclass Tag(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'tag'\n\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n    label = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    parent_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('tag.id'))\n\n    # Establishing the relationship\n    parent = relationship(\n        'Tag',\n        remote_side=[id],\n        backref=backref('children', lazy='dynamic')\n    )\n\n    def __init__(self, label, parent=None):\n        self.label = label\n        self.parent = parent\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`parent_id` Column**: This column is a foreign key that references the `id` column of the same table, establishing the self-referential aspect.\n\n- **`parent` Relationship**: This relationship is defined so that each `Tag` can have a parent `Tag`. The `remote_side` parameter specifies that the `id` column on the remote side (i.e., the parent `Tag`) is the target of the foreign key relationship.\n\n- **`backref`**: This creates a bidirectional relationship. By using `backref('children', lazy='dynamic')`, you can access a `Tag`'s children tags via the `children` attribute. The `lazy='dynamic'` option means that the collection of children will be loaded dynamically.\n\nUsing this setup, you can now create a hierarchy of tags where each tag can have zero or one parent and can have multiple children."
