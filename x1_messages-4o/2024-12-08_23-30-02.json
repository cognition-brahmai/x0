Here's a Python code snippet to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef redact_confidential_info(text):\n    # Define patterns for names and addresses\n    name_pattern = r'\\b(John Smith)\\b'\n    address_pattern = r'\\b(8 Main Street, Anytown)\\b'\n    \n    # Replace names and addresses with '[REDACTED]'\n    redacted_text = re.sub(name_pattern, '[REDACTED]', text)\n    redacted_text = re.sub(address_pattern, '[REDACTED]', redacted_text)\n    \n    return redacted_text\n\n# Given passage\npassage = \"John Smith is a software engineer at the ABC Company. His office address is 8 Main Street, Anytown.\"\n\n# Redact confidential information\nredacted_passage = redact_confidential_info(passage)\n\nprint(redacted_passage)\n```\n\nThis code defines patterns for recognizing the specific name \"John Smith\" and the address \"8 Main Street, Anytown.\" It then uses regular expressions to replace these patterns with \"[REDACTED]\" in the text. You can expand these patterns to match other names and addresses as needed."
