In the class, I have fields 'subject', 'message', and 'sender' defined, and when I call the as_table() method on an instance of this form, Django renders the fields in the same order as defined. I am wondering how Django knows the order of these class variables. Additionally, how can I override this order, particularly when I want to add a field from the class's 'init' method?\n\n```python\nclass ContactForm(forms.Form):\n    subject = forms.CharField(max_length=100)\n    message = forms.CharField()\n    sender = forms.EmailField()\n```"

        "content": "Django determines the order of form fields based on the order in which they are defined within the class. When you define fields in a Django form (or model), Django uses the order of their definition to store them in an `OrderedDict` internally, which preserves the order of insertion. This is why, when you call methods like `as_table()`, the fields are rendered in the order they are defined in your `ContactForm` class.\n\nIf you want to override the order of fields, particularly when you add a field dynamically in the `__init__` method, you can modify the `self.fields` attribute, which is an `OrderedDict`. Here's how you can add a field in the `__init__` method and rearrange the order of the fields:\n\n```python\nfrom django import forms\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\n\nclass ContactForm(forms.Form):\n    subject = forms.CharField(max_length=100)\n    message = forms.CharField()\n    sender = forms.EmailField()\n\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super(ContactForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n        # Dynamically add a new field\n        self.fields['extra'] = forms.CharField(required=False)\n        \n        # Define the order of fields explicitly\n        field_order = ['sender', 'extra', 'subject', 'message']\n        \n        # Reorder fields according to the specified order\n        self.fields = OrderedDict((k, self.fields[k]) for k in field_order if k in self.fields)\n```\n\nIn this example, we add a new field called `extra` in the `__init__` method. Then, we specify the desired order of fields in the `field_order` list. Finally, we create a new `OrderedDict` for `self.fields` based on this `field_order`. This ensures that when the form is rendered, the fields appear in the specified order. \n\nBy manipulating the `self.fields` attribute in this way, you have full control over the order of form fields in your Django forms."
