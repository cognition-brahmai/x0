I am struggling to find a direct way to do this without first exporting the model to a .pb file, then freezing it, etc. My model is used for classifying football exercises with 10 features and one label, with 5 different exercises. The trainData contains around 3500 rows and the testData contains around 330 rows. I am using a DNN classifier with n_classes=6. I am working on macOS 10.13.4 High Sierra, using TensorFlow Version 1.8.0, Python Version 3.6.4, and PyCharm Community 2018.1.3."

        "content": "To directly convert a TensorFlow model to a `.tflite` file without the intermediate steps of exporting to a `.pb` file and freezing it, you can use TensorFlow Lite Converter. However, TensorFlow 1.8.0 is quite outdated, and the direct conversion tools have improved significantly in later versions. If possible, consider upgrading to a more recent version of TensorFlow to simplify the process. Nevertheless, here's how you can do it with TensorFlow 1.8.0, using some manual steps:\n\n1. **Upgrade TensorFlow (Recommended):** If possible, upgrade your TensorFlow version to at least 1.12.0, where TensorFlow Lite support is significantly improved. You can do this using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install tensorflow==1.12.0\n   ```\n\n2. **Save the Model as a SavedModel:**\n   First, save your trained model in the SavedModel format. This is the recommended format for TensorFlow models and is required for conversion to TensorFlow Lite.\n\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n\n   # Assuming `classifier` is your trained DNNClassifier model\n   feature_spec = tf.feature_column.make_parse_example_spec(feature_columns)\n   serving_input_receiver_fn = tf.estimator.export.build_parsing_serving_input_receiver_fn(feature_spec)\n\n   saved_model_path = classifier.export_savedmodel(export_dir_base='exported_model', \n                                                   serving_input_receiver_fn=serving_input_receiver_fn)\n   ```\n\n3. **Convert the SavedModel to a TFLite Model:**\n   Use `tflite_convert` to convert the SavedModel to a TensorFlow Lite model.\n\n   ```bash\n   tflite_convert \\\n   --output_file=converted_model.tflite \\\n   --saved_model_dir=exported_model/<timestamp> \\\n   --output_format=TFLITE\n   ```\n\n   Here, `<timestamp>` is the directory created by the `export_savedmodel` function, which contains the exported model.\n\n4. **Handling TensorFlow 1.8.0:**\n   If upgrading is not possible and you must stick to TensorFlow 1.8.0, note that the TFLite converter API was less developed. You might have to manually upgrade your TensorFlow environment temporarily to convert the model or use a Docker container with a newer version of TensorFlow to perform the conversion.\n\n5. **Test the .tflite Model:**\n   Once converted, you can test the `.tflite` model on your device or emulator using the TFLite interpreter.\n\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n\n   interpreter = tf.lite.Interpreter(model_path=\"converted_model.tflite\")\n   interpreter.allocate_tensors()\n\n   # You can then use the interpreter to run inference on new data\n   ```\n\nIf you're unable to upgrade TensorFlow or encounter any issues, consider using a virtual environment or Docker to temporarily switch to a more recent TensorFlow version for conversion. This will not impact your primary environment."
