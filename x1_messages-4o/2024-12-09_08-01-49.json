However, when I try to import matplotlib.pyplot, it just hangs and does not return any error. I've waited for around 20 minutes and nothing happens. When I interrupt the import I get a traceback. I've tried different versions of matplotlib and even used the Enthought/Canopy python distribution but the problem persists. Can anyone explain why I'm seeing a recursive `for x in walk(new_path, topdown, onerror, followlinks):` in the traceback and how to solve this issue?"

        "content": "It sounds like you're experiencing a problem that could be related to Python's `os.walk` function getting stuck in a recursive loop, possibly due to symbolic links or a large directory structure. This can happen if there are circular symbolic links or if `os.walk` is traversing a large directory structure and takes a long time to complete.\n\nHere are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check for Circular Symbolic Links:**\n   - Ensure there are no circular symbolic links in your Python environment directories. Circular links can cause `os.walk` to enter an infinite loop.\n\n2. **Environment Variables:**\n   - Check your `PYTHONPATH` and any other environment variables that might influence where Python is looking for modules. Ensure there are no paths that could lead to circular references.\n\n3. **Matplotlib Configuration:**\n   - Sometimes, issues with matplotlib can be resolved by deleting or renaming the `matplotlib` configuration directory, which is often located in `~/.matplotlib` or `~/matplotlib` on OS X. Try renaming it and importing `matplotlib.pyplot` again to see if that resolves the issue.\n\n4. **Backend Configuration:**\n   - The issue might be related to the default backend that matplotlib is trying to use. You can try setting a different backend by adding the following lines to your script before importing `pyplot`:\n     ```python\n     import matplotlib\n     matplotlib.use('Agg')  # or 'TkAgg', 'Qt4Agg', etc., depending on your setup\n     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n     ```\n\n5. **Update Dependencies:**\n   - Ensure all your dependencies are up to date. You can use pip to update packages:\n     ```bash\n     pip install --upgrade matplotlib numpy\n     ```\n\n6. **Check for Large Directories:**\n   - If your working directory or any directories in your `PYTHONPATH` have a large number of files or directories, it might cause delays. Try setting your working directory to a simpler path with fewer files.\n\n7. **Reinstall Python and Virtual Environment:**\n   - If none of the above solutions work, consider reinstalling Python and setting up a new virtual environment to ensure a clean environment. This can often resolve issues caused by conflicting packages or configurations.\n\nTry these steps and see if they help resolve the issue. If the problem persists, you may want to check for any additional information in the full traceback or share it for further analysis."
