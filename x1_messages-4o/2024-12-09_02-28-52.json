        "content": "The error you're encountering seems to be related to the Octave environment on Ubuntu. It may arise from differences in how Octave handles certain functions or packages compared to other operating systems. Here are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Update Octave**: Ensure you're using a more recent version of Octave. Octave 4.0.0 is quite old, and updating to a newer version might resolve compatibility issues. You can update Octave by running the following commands:\n\n    ```bash\n    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:octave/stable\n    sudo apt-get update\n    sudo apt-get install octave\n    ```\n\n2. **Check for Missing Packages**: Sometimes, additional packages or dependencies might be necessary. Ensure you have all required packages by running:\n\n    ```bash\n    sudo apt-get install liboctave-dev\n    ```\n\n3. **Modify the Submission Script**: It's possible that there's an issue with the submission script. Open the `submit.m` or related script file and look for the lines mentioned in the error messages. Check if there's any reference to a 'message' field in a structure and see if there's a workaround, such as adding a check for the presence of this field or updating the script to handle it correctly.\n\n4. **Check for Network Issues**: Ensure that your network connection is stable. Sometimes, network issues can cause submission problems.\n\n5. **Run Octave with Debugging**: Try running Octave with debugging enabled to get more detailed error messages. This can help identify the problem more precisely. Start Octave with:\n\n    ```bash\n    octave --debug\n    ```\n\n6. **Consult Forums and Community**: Check the course forums or the Octave community for any known issues related to your problem. Other students or users might have faced similar issues and may have shared solutions.\n\n7. **Manual Submission**: If the problem persists, consider submitting your assignment manually if the course platform allows it. You can download the submission files and upload them directly through the course website.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the submission issue on your Ubuntu system. If you continue to experience difficulties, reaching out to the course's support team or forums with specific details may provide additional assistance."
