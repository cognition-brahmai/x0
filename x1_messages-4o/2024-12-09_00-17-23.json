        "content": "The code snippet you've provided seems correct, and it should not raise a `TypeError`. The `isinstance()` function requires the second argument to be a type or a tuple of types, and `list` is a valid type in Python. Here's your code again for reference:\n\n```python\nnames = ['jill', 'jack']\nprint(isinstance(names, list))  # This should return True\n```\n\nIf you're encountering the `TypeError` you mentioned, it might be due to something else in your environment or a typo elsewhere in your code. Here are a few things you can check:\n\n1. **Ensure `list` is not redefined**: Make sure that `list` hasn't been reassigned somewhere in your code. For example, if you have `list = 'something else'` earlier in your code, it would cause issues.\n\n2. **Check for imports or shadowing**: Ensure you're not importing or defining something that could be interfering with the `list` type.\n\n3. **Python Version**: Make sure you are using a standard version of Python. Sometimes modified environments can cause unexpected behavior.\n\n4. **Run in a clean environment**: Try running your code in a fresh Python environment or script to see if the error persists.\n\nIf none of these suggestions solve the issue, please provide more context or additional parts of your code so I can help you further."
