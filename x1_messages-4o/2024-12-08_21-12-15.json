The expression involves dividing the weight of one currency in the SDR by the weight of the other currency in the SDR, and then multiplying the result by the exchange rate of the latter currency."

Keep in mind that the SDR weights are determined by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and are subject to periodic review and adjustment."
