Does 'install_requires' only work with specific Python versions?"

        "content": "The `install_requires` option is part of the `setuptools` library, not `distutils`. If you're seeing a warning about an unknown distribution option, it's likely because your `setup.py` is using `distutils` instead of `setuptools`.\n\nHere's how you can modify your `setup.py` to ensure it uses `setuptools`:\n\n1. Make sure you import `setup` from `setuptools`, not `distutils`. Change the import statement at the top of your `setup.py`:\n\n   ```python\n   from setuptools import setup\n   ```\n\n2. If you haven't already, make sure `setuptools` is installed in your environment. You can install it using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install setuptools\n   ```\n\nBy using `setuptools`, your `install_requires` option should work correctly without warnings. If you continue to face issues, ensure that your environment is set up correctly, and you have the latest version of `setuptools` installed."
