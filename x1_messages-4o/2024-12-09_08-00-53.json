        "content": "The error you are encountering, `UnsupportedOperation: not readable`, occurs because you are trying to read from a file that has been opened in write mode (`\"w\"`). When a file is opened in write mode, it is not possible to read from it until it is closed and reopened in read mode.\n\nTo fix this issue, you should close the file after writing to it and then reopen it in read mode (`\"r\"`) before attempting to read from it. Here's the modified version of your code:\n\n```python\nline1 = []\nline1.append(\"xyz \")\nline1.append(\"abc\")\nline1.append(\"mno\")\n    \n# Open the file in write mode and write the lines to it\nwith open(\"File.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n    for line in line1:\n        file.write(line)\n        file.write(\"\\n\")\n\n# Reopen the file in read mode to read its contents\nwith open(\"File.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n    for line in file:\n        print(line, end=\"\")\n```\n\nIn this revised code:\n\n1. The `with` statement is used to open the file, which ensures that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an error occurs.\n2. The file is opened in write mode first to write the lines to it.\n3. After writing, the file is closed automatically due to the `with` statement.\n4. The file is then reopened in read mode (`\"r\"`) to read and print its contents.\n\nThis approach ensures that you can both write to and read from the file without encountering the `UnsupportedOperation` error."
