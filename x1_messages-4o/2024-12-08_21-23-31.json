        "content": "Certainly! H\u00fcckel's rule is used to determine the aromaticity of planar, cyclic, and conjugated organic compounds. A compound is considered aromatic if it has \\(4n + 2\\) \u03c0 electrons, where \\(n\\) is a non-negative integer (0, 1, 2, 3, ...).\n\nTo implement H\u00fcckel's rule in Swift, you can create a simple function that checks the number of \u03c0 electrons and determines if the compound is aromatic. Here's a basic example:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\n// Function to determine aromaticity using H\u00fcckel's rule\nfunc isAromatic(piElectrons: Int) -> Bool {\n    // Check if the number of \u03c0 electrons fits the 4n + 2 rule\n    return (piElectrons - 2) % 4 == 0\n}\n\n// Example usage\nlet compounds = [\n    (\"Benzene\", 6),  // Benzene has 6 \u03c0 electrons\n    (\"Cyclobutadiene\", 4), // Cyclobutadiene has 4 \u03c0 electrons\n    (\"Naphthalene\", 10), // Naphthalene has 10 \u03c0 electrons\n    (\"Cyclooctatetraene\", 8) // Cyclooctatetraene has 8 \u03c0 electrons\n]\n\nfor (name, piElectrons) in compounds {\n    if isAromatic(piElectrons: piElectrons) {\n        print(\"\\(name) is aromatic.\")\n    } else {\n        print(\"\\(name) is not aromatic.\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function `isAromatic` takes the number of \u03c0 electrons as input.\n- It checks if the number of \u03c0 electrons satisfies the \\(4n + 2\\) rule by rearranging it to \\((\\text{piElectrons} - 2) \\mod 4 == 0\\).\n- If the condition is satisfied, the compound is aromatic; otherwise, it is not.\n\n### Example Output:\n```\nBenzene is aromatic.\nCyclobutadiene is not aromatic.\nNaphthalene is aromatic.\nCyclooctatetraene is not aromatic.\n```\n\nThis code provides a simple demonstration of using H\u00fcckel's rule in Swift to determine the aromaticity of various compounds based on their \u03c0 electron count. Adjust the list of compounds and their \u03c0 electron counts as needed for further analysis."
