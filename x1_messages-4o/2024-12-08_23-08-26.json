        "content": "To create a table in Excel that calculates the sum of the cubes of the first ten positive integers and highlights the number with the highest cube value, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create the Table:**\n   - Open Excel and create a new worksheet.\n   - In column A, enter the numbers 1 through 10 (from A2 to A11).\n   - In column B, enter the formula to calculate the cube of each number.\n\n2. **Enter the Cube Formula:**\n   - In cell B2, enter the formula `=A2^3` to calculate the cube of the number in A2.\n   - Drag the fill handle from B2 down to B11 to fill the cubes of the numbers from 1 to 10.\n\n3. **Create a New Table for Display:**\n   - Select the range A1:B11.\n   - Go to the \"Insert\" tab and click \"Table\" to convert the range into a table for better formatting.\n\n4. **Calculate the Sum of Cubes:**\n   - In a separate cell (e.g., B13), enter the formula `=SUM(B2:B11)` to calculate the sum of the cubes.\n\n5. **Conditional Formatting:**\n   - Select the range B2:B11.\n   - Go to the \"Home\" tab, click on \"Conditional Formatting,\" choose \"New Rule,\" and select \"Format only cells that contain.\"\n   - Set the rule to format cells that are equal to `=MAX($B$2:$B$11)`.\n   - Choose a formatting style (e.g., fill color) to highlight the cell with the highest cube value.\n\n6. **Add Headers:**\n   - Add headers in cells A1 and B1: \"Number\" in A1 and \"Cube\" in B1.\n\nNow, you will have a table that lists the first ten positive integers, their corresponding cubes, and the number with the highest cube value highlighted. Additionally, the sum of the cubes will be displayed separately."
