        "content": "In Python, environment variables must be set as strings. When you attempt to set an environment variable with a non-string value, you'll encounter an error, as environment variables are expected to be strings. Here\u2019s how you can set and read environment variables properly in Python:\n\n### Setting Environment Variables\n\nTo set an environment variable, you should convert the value to a string:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Set environment variable\nos.environ[\"DEBUSSY\"] = \"1\"  # Ensure the value is a string\n```\n\n### Reading Environment Variables\n\nYou can read environment variables using `os.environ.get()` or by directly accessing `os.environ` with the key. Using `os.environ.get()` is generally safer because it allows you to provide a default value if the environment variable is not set:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Read environment variable\nvalue = os.environ.get(\"DEBUSSY\")\nprint(value)  # This will print '1'\n\n# Alternatively, directly access the environment variable\nvalue_direct = os.environ[\"DEBUSSY\"]\nprint(value_direct)  # This will also print '1'\n```\n\n### Notes\n\n1. **Data Type**: Always remember that environment variables are stored as strings. If you need to store other data types, like integers or booleans, you'll need to convert them to and from strings when setting and reading the variables.\n\n2. **Scope**: Environment variables set in a script will only persist for the duration of the script. If you need them to persist beyond the execution of your script, you\u2019ll need to set them in your operating system's environment configuration.\n\n3. **Default Values**: When using `os.environ.get()`, you can specify a default value that will be returned if the environment variable is not found:\n\n   ```python\n   value = os.environ.get(\"UNKNOWN_VAR\", \"default_value\")\n   print(value)  # This will print 'default_value' if \"UNKNOWN_VAR\" is not set.\n   ```\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to effectively set and read environment variables in Python."
