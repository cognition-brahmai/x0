The reason seems to be that the borders of the bars are black and due to the high number of points, they all appear squished together, making the bars look black. Is there a method to remove the bar borders so that I can see the intended color of the bars?"

        "content": "Yes, you can remove the borders of the bars in a bar plot created using `matplotlib.pyplot.bar` by setting the `edgecolor` parameter to `'none'`. This will remove the black borders and allow you to see the intended color of the bars more clearly. Here's an example of how you can do this:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Sample data\ncategories = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']\nvalues = [10, 20, 15, 25, 30]\n\n# Create bar plot with no borders\nplt.bar(categories, values, color='blue', edgecolor='none')\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this example, the `edgecolor='none'` parameter removes the borders of the bars. You can replace `'blue'` with your desired color or a list of colors if you have multiple bars with different colors. If you have a large number of bars, removing the borders should help you see the actual colors more clearly."
