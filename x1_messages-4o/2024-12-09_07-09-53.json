In my Flask script, I have the following lines of code:\n\n```python\nanimal = dog\nreturn render_template('index.html', value=animal)\n```\n\nAnd in my HTML, I have:\n\n```html\n<h3>I like the animal: {{ value }}<h3>\n```\n\nHowever, rather than displaying 'dog', it displays the variable name 'animal'. Could you please help me understand how I can correctly display the Python variable in HTML?"

You should ensure that the variable `animal` is assigned correctly as a string. Here's how you can do it:\n\nIn your Flask script, make sure the variable `animal` is assigned a string value:\n\n```python\nanimal = \"dog\"  # Ensure \"dog\" is in quotes to make it a string\nreturn render_template('index.html', value=animal)\n```\n\nAnd in your HTML template (`index.html`), your code is already correct:\n\n```html\n<h3>I like the animal: {{ value }}</h3>\n```\n\nWith these changes, when you run your Flask application, it should correctly display \"I like the animal: dog\" on your webpage. If you are still experiencing issues, double-check to ensure that the Flask route and the template are correctly set up and that there are no syntax errors in your code."
