After installing Spacy using `sudo pip3 install spacy` and downloading the English language model with `sudo python3 -m spacy download en`, I'm unable to import the English module in my code with `from spacy.en import English`. This results in the following error: `ImportError: No module named 'spacy.en'`. Despite searching online, I've not found a solution. Can you help me resolve this?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to a change in the way SpaCy handles language models in its newer versions. The module `spacy.en` has been deprecated. Instead, language models are now loaded as separate packages. Here's how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Install SpaCy and the English Model Correctly:**\n\n   You can install SpaCy and the English language model using the following commands:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install spacy\n   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm\n   ```\n\n   Note: You don't need to use `sudo` unless you're installing system-wide and have permission issues.\n\n2. **Import and Load the Model in Your Code:**\n\n   Instead of `from spacy.en import English`, you should now load the model like this:\n\n   ```python\n   import spacy\n\n   # Load the English model\n   nlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Using the Model:**\n\n   After loading, you can use the `nlp` variable to process text:\n\n   ```python\n   doc = nlp(\"This is a sentence.\")\n   for token in doc:\n       print(token.text, token.pos_, token.dep_)\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the import error and use SpaCy with the English language model in your projects. If you have any other questions or run into further issues, feel free to ask!"
