The sentence you provided, \"Jane said she forgot the key to the house again,\" is a simple declarative sentence and doesn't require any special punctuation outside of the standard English grammar rules. However, if you wanted to emphasize or clarify certain parts of the sentence, you might consider the following:\n\n1. If you're quoting Jane directly, you would use quotation marks:\n   ```latex\n   Jane said, \"She forgot the key to the house again.\"\n   ```\n\n2. If you want to emphasize \"again,\" you might use italics:\n   ```latex\n   Jane said she forgot the key to the house \\emph{again}.\n   ```\n\n3. If you want to add a pause for emphasis after \"house,\" you could use a comma:\n   ```latex\n   Jane said she forgot the key to the house, again.\n   ```\n\nIn standard cases with LaTeX, you'd write the sentence as you would in normal English text, ensuring that you follow proper grammatical rules."
