        "content": "Yes, you can easily check which GPU has been allocated to your Google Colab session. You can use the following code snippet in your Colab notebook to find out the GPU details:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Check if GPU is available\nif tf.test.is_gpu_available():\n    # Get the list of available GPUs\n    gpus = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')\n    \n    # Print GPU details\n    for gpu in gpus:\n        print(f\"Device: {gpu.name}, Type: {gpu.device_type}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No GPU found, using CPU instead.\")\n```\n\nThis code will print out the details of the GPU currently allocated to your session, including its name and type. Note that `tf.test.is_gpu_available()` is a deprecated method in the newer versions of TensorFlow, but it should still work. If you are using TensorFlow 2.x, you might prefer to use `tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')` directly as shown in the loop.\n\nRunning this code will help you confirm which GPU you are using for your deep learning tasks in Google Colab."
