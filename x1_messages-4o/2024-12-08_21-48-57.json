        "content": "To ensure that every generated random string is unique in Go, you can enhance your existing code by implementing a mechanism that efficiently checks for uniqueness without compromising performance. Here are some strategies you can use:\n\n1. **Use a Set for Uniqueness Check**: Use a data structure like a map to store and check for the uniqueness of generated strings. A map in Go provides average constant-time complexity for inserts and lookups.\n\n2. **UUIDs for Random Strings**: Consider using a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier), which is designed to be unique across space and time. The `github.com/google/uuid` package in Go provides a straightforward way to generate UUIDs.\n\n3. **Hashing with Bloom Filters**: If memory usage is a concern, you might use a Bloom filter to probabilistically check for string existence, allowing for a small probability of false positives but reducing memory usage.\n\n4. **Concurrency Considerations**: If your application is concurrent, ensure that access to the map or any shared resource is synchronized using mutexes or other concurrency primitives.\n\nHere is an example Go code that demonstrates using a map to ensure uniqueness:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"crypto/rand\"\n\t\"encoding/hex\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"sync\"\n)\n\nvar (\n\tgeneratedStrings = make(map[string]struct{})\n\tmu               sync.Mutex\n)\n\nfunc generateRandomString(n int) (string, error) {\n\tbytes := make([]byte, n)\n\tif _, err := rand.Read(bytes); err != nil {\n\t\treturn \"\", err\n\t}\n\treturn hex.EncodeToString(bytes), nil\n}\n\nfunc generateUniqueRandomString(n int) (string, error) {\n\tfor {\n\t\tstr, err := generateRandomString(n)\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\treturn \"\", err\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tmu.Lock()\n\t\tif _, exists := generatedStrings[str]; !exists {\n\t\t\tgeneratedStrings[str] = struct{}{}\n\t\t\tmu.Unlock()\n\t\t\treturn str, nil\n\t\t}\n\t\tmu.Unlock()\n\t}\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tfor i := 0; i < 10; i++ {\n\t\tstr, err := generateUniqueRandomString(16)\n\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\tfmt.Println(\"Error generating string:\", err)\n\t\t\tcontinue\n\t\t}\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Generated unique string:\", str)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Random String Generation**: We use `crypto/rand` to generate a random byte slice, which is then encoded to a hexadecimal string.\n- **Uniqueness Check**: A global map `generatedStrings` is used to track strings that have already been generated. The map is protected by a mutex `mu` to handle concurrent access safely.\n- **Retry Mechanism**: The `generateUniqueRandomString` function continues generating new strings until it finds one that hasn't been seen before.\n\n### Performance Considerations:\n- **Map Operations**: Maps provide efficient average constant-time complexity for checking existence and inserting elements.\n- **Mutex Locking**: Locking is minimized by keeping the critical section (the check and insert) as short as possible.\n- **Memory Usage**: The memory usage will grow with the number of unique strings generated. Consider using a more memory-efficient structure like a Bloom filter if necessary.\n\nThis approach provides a balance between ensuring uniqueness and maintaining performance."
