        "content": "To solve this problem, we'll start by defining an equation for the depreciation of the car. The value of the car decreases by 10% each year over 5 years. \n\n### Depreciation Equation:\nLet \\( V(t) \\) be the value of the car after \\( t \\) years. The initial value of the car, \\( V(0) \\), is $25,000. The depreciation equation is:\n\n\\[ V(t) = V(0) \\times (1 - 0.10)^t \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( V(0) = 25000 \\)\n- \\( t \\) is the number of years.\n\n### Yearly Depreciation Value Table:\nThe yearly depreciation value is the amount by which the car's value decreases each year.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n\\text{Year} & \\text{Yearly Depreciation Value (\\$)} \\\\\n\\hline\n1 & 25000 \\times 0.10 = 2500 \\\\\n2 & 25000 \\times (1 - 0.10) \\times 0.10 = 2250 \\\\\n3 & 25000 \\times (1 - 0.10)^2 \\times 0.10 = 2025 \\\\\n4 & 25000 \\times (1 - 0.10)^3 \\times 0.10 = 1822.5 \\\\\n5 & 25000 \\times (1 - 0.10)^4 \\times 0.10 = 1640.25 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n### Accumulated Depreciation Value Table:\nThe accumulated depreciation value is the total amount of depreciation up to each year.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n\\text{Year} & \\text{Accumulated Depreciation Value (\\$)} \\\\\n\\hline\n1 & 2500 \\\\\n2 & 2500 + 2250 = 4750 \\\\\n3 & 4750 + 2025 = 6775 \\\\\n4 & 6775 + 1822.5 = 8597.5 \\\\\n5 & 8597.5 + 1640.25 = 10237.75 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n### Inflation Impact Explanation:\nInflation affects the value of money over time, reducing the purchasing power of future amounts. While the car's nominal depreciation is calculated using a fixed percentage, inflation means that the actual value of money saved through depreciation may be less in real terms. If inflation is higher than expected, the real cost of owning the car will increase, as the future dollars saved due to depreciation won't have the same purchasing power. This could impact the equation by effectively increasing the cost of owning the car over its lifetime, especially if inflation exceeds the expected rate.\n\n### SQL Query:\nTo calculate the total cost of the car after 5 years considering a yearly inflation rate of 2%, we can adjust the accumulated depreciation value for inflation. Assuming the car's salvage value is zero, the query could look something like this:\n\n```sql\nWITH Depreciation AS (\n  SELECT\n    25000 AS initial_value,\n    0.10 AS rate,\n    0 AS year,\n    25000 AS remaining_value\n  UNION ALL\n  SELECT\n    d.initial_value,\n    d.rate,\n    d.year + 1,\n    d.remaining_value * (1 - d.rate) AS remaining_value\n  FROM\n    Depreciation d\n  WHERE\n    d.year < 5\n),\nInflationAdjusted AS (\n  SELECT\n    year,\n    remaining_value,\n    remaining_value * POWER(1.02, year) AS inflation_adjusted_value\n  FROM\n    Depreciation\n)\nSELECT\n  MAX(year) AS total_years,\n  initial_value - MIN(remaining_value) AS total_depreciation,\n  initial_value - MIN(inflation_adjusted_value) AS inflation_adjusted_depreciation\nFROM\n  InflationAdjusted;\n```\n\nThis query calculates the remaining value of the car each year, adjusts it for a 2% inflation rate, and then computes both the total depreciation and the inflation-adjusted depreciation over 5 years."
