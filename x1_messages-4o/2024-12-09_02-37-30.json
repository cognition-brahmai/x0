        "content": "The error \"SMTP AUTH extension not supported by server\" typically occurs when the SMTP server you're trying to use does not support authentication. Based on your Telnet output, it seems that the server does not advertise the `AUTH` capability, which is necessary for authentication. Here's what you can try to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify SMTP Server Supports Authentication**: First, confirm with your email provider or server administrator that the SMTP server supports authentication. Some servers may require you to use a different hostname or port for authenticated access.\n\n2. **Check Port and Connection Settings**: Ensure that you're using the correct port and connection settings for SMTP authentication. Common ports for SMTP are 587 and 465 (for SSL/TLS). You may need to adjust your code to use these ports.\n\n3. **Update Your Code**: Modify your code to use a port that supports authentication, and ensure you're using the correct protocol. Try using `smtplib.SMTP_SSL` for SSL connections on port 465, or `smtplib.SMTP` with `starttls()` on port 587.\n\nHere's an example using port 587 with `starttls()`:\n\n```python\nimport smtplib\nfrom email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart\nfrom email.mime.text import MIMEText\n\nfromaddr = \"test1@example.com\"\ntoaddr = \"test2@example.com\"\nmsg = MIMEMultipart()\nmsg['From'] = fromaddr\nmsg['To'] = toaddr\nmsg['Subject'] = \"Test Mail\"\n\nbody = \"Test mail from python\"\nmsg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))\n\n# Use the correct SMTP server and port for authentication\nserver = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.example.com', 587)\nserver.ehlo()\nserver.starttls()  # Secure the connection\nserver.ehlo()\n\n# Authenticate with the server\nserver.login(fromaddr, \"password\")\n\ntext = msg.as_string()\nserver.sendmail(fromaddr, toaddr, text)\nserver.quit()\n```\n\n4. **Contact Support**: If the server does not support authentication, you may need to contact your email provider or server administrator to enable it or provide an alternative solution.\n\n5. **Use an Alternative SMTP Server**: If your current SMTP server doesn't support authentication, consider using a different SMTP server that does, such as Gmail's SMTP server, though you might need to adjust your security settings for that account.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and send emails successfully from your application."
