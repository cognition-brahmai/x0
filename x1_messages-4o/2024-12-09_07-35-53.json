I have set up an input pipeline/queue configuration that reads images from a directory tree and prepares batches. I am using the code for CNN from a certain source and when I run this, my program crashes at tf.nn.conv2d with the error \"TypeError: Value passed to parameter 'input' has DataType uint8 not in list of allowed values: float16, float32\". How can I solve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering indicates that the input to the `tf.nn.conv2d` function is of type `uint8`, but TensorFlow expects the input to be a floating-point type, such as `float32`. This is a common issue when dealing with image data, as images are often loaded as `uint8` arrays with pixel values ranging from 0 to 255. To resolve this issue, you'll need to convert your image data to a floating-point type and normalize it appropriately.\n\nHere's how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Convert the data type**: Before feeding your images into the CNN, convert them from `uint8` to `float32`. This can be done using TensorFlow operations.\n\n2. **Normalize the pixel values**: Once converted to `float32`, it's a common practice to normalize the pixel values to the range [0, 1] by dividing by 255.0.\n\nHere's a snippet of code that demonstrates how you can perform these steps:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Assuming 'image' is your input tensor with dtype uint8\nimage_uint8 = ...  # Load or obtain your image tensor here\n\n# Convert the image to float32\nimage_float32 = tf.cast(image_uint8, tf.float32)\n\n# Normalize the image\nimage_normalized = image_float32 / 255.0\n\n# Now you can feed image_normalized into the CNN\noutput = tf.nn.conv2d(image_normalized, filter=your_filter, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding='SAME')\n```\n\nMake sure that you apply these conversions and normalizations to your entire input pipeline, so that all images fed into the CNN are processed correctly. If you're using a data pipeline with `tf.data.Dataset`, you can include these steps in your mapping function that processes each image."
