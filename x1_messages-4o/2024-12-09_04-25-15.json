For example, if I have a string such as \"hello123\", I want to be able to identify that the string ends with a number and then print that number (\"123\" in this case). However, I am having trouble adapting this to situations where I am looping through a file with strings that have different lengths of trailing numbers, such as:\n\n```\nhello123\nhello12324\nhello12435436346\n```\n\nIn such cases, I am unable to select the number using `string[:]` due to the variation in the number lengths. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To extract the trailing numbers from a string in Python, you can use a regular expression. Regular expressions allow you to search for patterns within strings, making it easier to identify and extract numbers regardless of their length. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. Import the `re` module, which provides support for regular expressions.\n2. Use the `re.search()` function to find the pattern of digits at the end of the string.\n3. If a match is found, extract the matched digits.\n\nHere's a code example to demonstrate how you can do this for a string and apply it to each line in a file:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_trailing_numbers(s):\n    # Use a regular expression to find digits at the end of the string\n    match = re.search(r'\\d+$', s)\n    if match:\n        return match.group()\n    return None\n\n# Example strings\nstrings = [\n    \"hello123\",\n    \"hello12324\",\n    \"hello12435436346\"\n]\n\n# Iterate over each string and extract trailing numbers\nfor string in strings:\n    trailing_numbers = extract_trailing_numbers(string)\n    if trailing_numbers:\n        print(f\"The string '{string}' ends with the number: {trailing_numbers}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The string '{string}' does not end with a number.\")\n```\n\nIn this script:\n\n- The regular expression `r'\\d+$'` is used to find one or more digits (`\\d+`) at the end of the string (`$`).\n- `re.search()` is used to search for this pattern in the given string.\n- If a match is found, `match.group()` returns the matched substring, which contains the trailing numbers.\n\nThis approach will work even if the length of the trailing numbers varies between different strings."
