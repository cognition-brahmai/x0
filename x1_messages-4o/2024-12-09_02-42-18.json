It will evaluate to `True` if `A` is anything other than `None`, including `0`, `False`, `[]`, `{}`, `''`, or any other value that is not `None`.\n\n- `if A:` checks for the truthiness of `A`. It will evaluate to `True` if `A` is any truthy value. It will evaluate to `False` if `A` is any falsy value, which includes `None`, `0`, `False`, `[]`, `{}`, `''`, and other similar values.\n\nIf you want to ensure that `A` is not `None`, you should use `if A is not None:`. If you want to check if `A` is truthy and don't care specifically about `None`, then `if A:` is appropriate."
