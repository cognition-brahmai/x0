But, when I type 'python' into PowerShell, I get an error that says the term 'python' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. I tried setting the environment variable with `[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(\"Path\", \"$env:Path;C:\\Python27\", \"User\")`, a solution that was suggested, but it still doesn't work. Typing \"start python\" opens up a window with Python, but I need it in PowerShell. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "To run Python from PowerShell, you need to ensure that the Python executable is correctly referenced in your system's PATH environment variable. It looks like you tried to set the PATH, but it might not have been set for the current PowerShell session or system-wide. Here\u2019s how you can check and set it properly:\n\n### Check the PATH Environment Variable\n\n1. Open PowerShell.\n2. Type the following command to check if `C:\\Python27` is in your PATH:\n   ```powershell\n   $env:Path -split ';'\n   ```\n   Look through the list to see if `C:\\Python27` is included. If not, you\u2019ll need to add it.\n\n### Add Python to PATH\n\n#### System-wide Setting\n\n1. **Open System Properties:**\n   - Right-click on 'This PC' or 'My Computer' on your desktop or in File Explorer and select 'Properties'.\n   - Click on 'Advanced system settings'.\n   - In the 'System Properties' window, click on the 'Environment Variables' button.\n\n2. **Edit PATH:**\n   - In the 'Environment Variables' window, under 'System variables', look for a variable named `Path`. Select it and click 'Edit'.\n   - In the 'Edit Environment Variable' window, click 'New' and add `C:\\Python27`.\n   - Click 'OK' to close each window.\n\n3. **Restart PowerShell** to ensure the changes take effect.\n\n#### User-specific Setting\n\nAlternatively, you can set it for the current user:\n\n1. In the 'Environment Variables' window, under 'User variables for [Your Username]', find `Path` and click 'Edit'. If it doesn\u2019t exist, click 'New' and type `Path`.\n2. Add `C:\\Python27` to the list.\n3. Click 'OK' to close each window.\n\n### Verify Python Installation\n\nAfter setting the PATH, verify the installation:\n\n1. Open a new PowerShell window.\n2. Type `python` and press Enter. It should start the Python interpreter.\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- If you\u2019re still having issues, ensure there\u2019s no typo in the path.\n- Ensure there are no additional spaces or semicolons at inappropriate places in the PATH variable.\n\nFollowing these steps should allow you to run Python from PowerShell successfully. If you continue to encounter issues, restarting your system may help apply the changes."
