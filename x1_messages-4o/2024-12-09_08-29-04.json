I'm having trouble understanding how to use `setup_class` and `teardown_class` methods. I am trying to set up a browser in the `setup_class` method, perform a series of tests defined as class methods, and finally quit the browser in the `teardown_class` method. But I'm confused whether it's correct to create a browser instance for the class or should it be created for every object separately? Should I use `__init__` and `__del__` methods instead of `setup_class` and `teardown_class`? Here is the code I've attempted:\n\n```python\nclass TestClass:\n  \n    def setup_class(cls):\n        pass\n        \n    def test_buttons(self, data):\n        # self.$attribute can be used, but not cls.$attribute?  \n        pass\n        \n    def test_buttons2(self, data):\n        # self.$attribute can be used, but not cls.$attribute?\n        pass\n        \n    def teardown_class(cls):\n        pass\n```"

        "content": "When using `pytest` for end-to-end testing with Selenium, it's common to set up and tear down resources like a browser instance at the class level when you want the same browser session to be shared among all tests within a class. This approach can save time by avoiding the need to restart the browser for each test method, which is useful for tests that do not alter the state in a way that affects other tests.\n\nTo correctly implement `setup_class` and `teardown_class`, you should define these methods as `classmethods` and use the `@classmethod` decorator. This allows you to access class-level resources using `cls`. Here's how you can structure your code:\n\n```python\nfrom selenium import webdriver\n\nclass TestClass:\n\n    @classmethod\n    def setup_class(cls):\n        # Initialize the browser instance at the start of the test class\n        cls.driver = webdriver.Chrome()  # or any other browser driver\n        cls.driver.implicitly_wait(10)  # Implicit wait for elements to load\n\n    def test_buttons(self):\n        # Use cls.driver to interact with the browser\n        cls.driver.get(\"https://example.com\")\n        # Perform actions and assertions on the page\n        button = cls.driver.find_element_by_id(\"button-id\")\n        assert button.is_displayed()\n        \n    def test_buttons2(self):\n        # Use cls.driver again for another test case\n        cls.driver.get(\"https://example.com/other-page\")\n        # Perform actions and assertions on the page\n        button = cls.driver.find_element_by_id(\"another-button-id\")\n        assert button.is_enabled()\n\n    @classmethod\n    def teardown_class(cls):\n        # Quit the browser at the end of the test class\n        cls.driver.quit()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Using `@classmethod` Decorator**: `setup_class` and `teardown_class` are decorated with `@classmethod`, which allows you to use `cls` to access class-level attributes like `cls.driver`.\n\n2. **Browser Initialization**: The browser (e.g., `webdriver.Chrome()`) is initialized once for the entire class, making the browser session available for all test methods.\n\n3. **Accessing Class Attributes**: Use `cls.attribute` to refer to class-level variables, like `cls.driver`, within your test methods.\n\n4. **Cleanup**: Ensure that `cls.driver.quit()` is called in `teardown_class` to close the browser after all tests in the class are executed.\n\n5. **Avoid using `__init__` and `__del__`**: These methods are not typically used for test setup and teardown in `pytest`. Instead, use `setup_class` and `teardown_class` for class-level setup and teardown activities.\n\nBy following this structure, you can efficiently manage browser setup and teardown while running your Selenium tests with `pytest`."
