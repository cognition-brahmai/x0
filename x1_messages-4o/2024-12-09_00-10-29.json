Here\u2019s how you can insert some initial values:\n   ```sql\n   INSERT INTO function_values (x, y)\n   VALUES\n     (-1, 2*(-1)*(-1)*(-1) - 4*(-1) + 2),\n     (0, 2*(0)*(0)*(0) - 4*(0) + 2),\n     (1, 2*(1)*(1)*(1) - 4*(1) + 2),\n     (2, 2*(2)*(2)*(2) - 4*(2) + 2);\n   ```\n\n3. **Find the zeros of the function**:\n   Use the following query to select x-values where y is equal to 0:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT x\n   FROM function_values\n   WHERE y = 0;\n   ```\n\nTo accurately find zeros, you should consider a broader range of x-values and possibly smaller increments. This approach will give you an approximate zero unless you already have calculated values as shown in the example."
