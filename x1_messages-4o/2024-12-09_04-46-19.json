I tried to add a channel using the command `conda config --add channels glotzer`, but this resulted in the channel being available from all my conda environments instead of only the specific one I intended. I noticed that my `~/.condarc` file now reads:\n\n```\nchannels:\n  - glotzer\n  - defaults\n```\nHow can I configure conda so the channel is only available from a specific environment? I have read in the channel documentation that for conda versions 4.1.0 and higher, channels can be placed at the bottom of the `~/.condarc` to prevent added channels from overriding the core package set. This might prevent some issues, but what if I want the package added through a channel to override a core package in one environment?"

        "content": "To add a conda channel to a specific conda environment, you need to modify the configuration for that particular environment rather than the global configuration. Here's how you can do that:\n\n1. **Activate the Environment**: First, activate the environment to which you want to add the channel. You can do this with the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda activate my_env\n   ```\n\n   Replace `my_env` with the name of your environment.\n\n2. **Create an Environment-specific Configuration File**: Conda allows you to have an environment-specific configuration file. You can set the desired channel by creating a `.condarc` file within the environment's directory.\n\n3. **Modify the `.condarc` File**: Locate the environment directory, which is typically found in the `envs` folder within your Anaconda or Miniconda installation directory. Once you find the directory for your specific environment, create or edit a `.condarc` file within that directory with the following content:\n\n   ```yaml\n   channels:\n     - glotzer\n     - defaults\n   ```\n\n   This sets the `glotzer` channel for just that environment.\n\n4. **Verify the Channel Addition**: You can verify that the channel is added to the specific environment by checking the configuration:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda config --show\n   ```\n\n   Make sure to run this command while the environment is activated to see the environment-specific configuration.\n\n5. **Install Packages with Priority**: When you install packages, Conda will prioritize the channels listed in the `.condarc` of the specific environment. If you want to ensure that a package from the `glotzer` channel overrides a core package, make sure the channel is listed before `defaults`.\n\nBy following these steps, you can manage channels for individual environments without affecting the global configuration or other environments."
