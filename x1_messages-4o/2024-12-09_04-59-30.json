Is there a way to specify specific versions of Python with pipenv?\n\n<pre><code>$ pipenv --python 3.6\nWarning: Python 3.6 was not found on your system\u2026\nYou can specify specific versions of Python with:\n  $ pipenv --python path/to/python\n</code></pre>"

        "content": "To set up a pipenv environment with Python 3.6 on your Ubuntu 16.04.03 system, you'll need to first install Python 3.6, as your current setup does not have it. Here are the steps to achieve this:\n\n### Step 1: Add the Deadsnakes PPA\n\nFirst, you need to add a Personal Package Archive (PPA) that contains newer Python versions. The Deadsnakes PPA is a popular choice.\n\nOpen a terminal and run the following commands:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install software-properties-common\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa\nsudo apt update\n```\n\n### Step 2: Install Python 3.6\n\nNow that you've added the PPA, install Python 3.6:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install python3.6\n```\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Installation\n\nCheck that Python 3.6 has been installed correctly:\n\n```bash\npython3.6 --version\n```\n\nYou should see the version number confirming the installation.\n\n### Step 4: Create a Pipenv Environment with Python 3.6\n\nNow that Python 3.6 is installed, you can create a pipenv environment specifying the path to the Python 3.6 binary.\n\n```bash\npipenv --python /usr/bin/python3.6\n```\n\nThis command tells pipenv to use the Python 3.6 interpreter located at `/usr/bin/python3.6`.\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- If you need to work with multiple Python versions often, consider using `pyenv`, a tool that lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Python.\n- Make sure that pipenv is installed. If not, you can install it using pip:\n\n  ```bash\n  pip install pipenv\n  ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to set up a pipenv environment with Python 3.6 on your system."
