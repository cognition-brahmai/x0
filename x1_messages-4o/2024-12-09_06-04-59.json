I have a fully functional installation of Python 2.7.x, and I'd like to run the test example of queueing-tool, which requires installing pygraphviz using pip. When executing the command \"pip install pygraphviz\", I get a lengthy error message. The error message includes warnings about unused variables and a subprocess.CalledProcessError. I am unsure about how to address the above error. All other Python packages, such as numpy or networkx, were straightforward to install. Can someone guide me on how to solve this issue?"

        "content": "Installing `pygraphviz` on macOS can sometimes be tricky due to dependencies on Graphviz, a graph visualization software. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you resolve the installation issue:\n\n1. **Install Graphviz:**\n   First, ensure that Graphviz is installed on your system. You can install it using Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can install it by pasting the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n   ```\n\n   Once Homebrew is installed, run the following command to install Graphviz:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew install graphviz\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify Graphviz Installation:**\n   After installation, verify that Graphviz is correctly installed:\n\n   ```bash\n   dot -V\n   ```\n\n   This command should display the version of Graphviz installed.\n\n3. **Set Environment Variables:**\n   You might need to set some environment variables to help `pygraphviz` locate the Graphviz installation. Add the following lines to your `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, or appropriate shell configuration file:\n\n   ```bash\n   export GRAPHVIZ_LIBDIR=$(brew --prefix graphviz)/lib\n   export GRAPHVIZ_BINDIR=$(brew --prefix graphviz)/bin\n   ```\n\n   Then, reload your shell configuration:\n\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bash_profile\n   ```\n\n   or\n\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.zshrc\n   ```\n\n4. **Install pygraphviz:**\n   Now, try to install `pygraphviz` again using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pygraphviz\n   ```\n\n5. **Install from Source (If Needed):**\n   If the installation still fails, you can try installing `pygraphviz` from source:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/pygraphviz/pygraphviz.git\n   cd pygraphviz\n   python setup.py install\n   ```\n\n   If you get errors during this process, make sure the `include` and `library` directories are correctly pointing to your Graphviz installation. You can specify them explicitly:\n\n   ```bash\n   python setup.py build_ext --include-path=/usr/local/include --library-path=/usr/local/lib\n   python setup.py install\n   ```\n\n6. **Check Installation:**\n   Finally, verify the installation by running a simple Python script that imports pygraphviz:\n\n   ```python\n   import pygraphviz\n   print(pygraphviz.__version__)\n   ```\n\nIf you encounter any specific errors during these steps, please provide the error message so I can offer more precise assistance."
