For example, I have this numpy array:\n\n```python\nY = np.arange(16).reshape(4,4)\n```\n\nI want to extract columns/rows 0 and 3 from this array. The resultant matrix should look like this:\n\n```python\n[[0 3]\n [12 15]]\n```\n\nI've attempted to use all the reshape functions but I'm unable to achieve this. Can anyone provide any guidance or ideas on how to do this?"

        "content": "To extract specific rows and columns from a NumPy array, you can use advanced indexing. In your case, you want to extract rows 0 and 3, and columns 0 and 3 from the array `Y`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Create the array\nY = np.arange(16).reshape(4, 4)\n\n# Use advanced indexing to extract the desired submatrix\nresult = Y[[0, 3], :][:, [0, 3]]\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will give you the following output:\n\n```\n[[ 0  3]\n [12 15]]\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `Y[[0, 3], :]` selects the rows 0 and 3 from `Y`, giving you a temporary intermediate array of shape (2, 4).\n- `[:, [0, 3]]` then selects the columns 0 and 3 from the intermediate array, resulting in the final 2x2 submatrix."
