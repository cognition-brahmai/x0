When I try to do so in Python 3.4.0, I get an ImportError that says: No module named '_ctypes'. The full traceback is as follows:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n   File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n   File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.4/multiprocessing/context.py\", line 132, in Value\n      from .sharedctypes import Value\n   File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.4/multiprocessing/sharedctypes.py\", line 10, in <module>\n   import ctypes\n   File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.4/ctypes/__init__.py\", line 7, in <module>\n      from _ctypes import Union, Structure, Array\nImportError: No module named '_ctypes'\n```\n\nI recently updated to Python 3.4.0 from 3.3.2 by installing from the source, which installed Python 3.4.0 in `/usr/local/lib/python3.4`. I noticed that Python 3.3.2 is still installed in `usr/lib`, so it wasn't overwritten. Did I update to Python 3.4 correctly? How can I resolve this ImportError?"

        "content": "The ImportError you're encountering is due to the `_ctypes` module not being available in your Python 3.4.0 installation. This issue often arises because the necessary development packages for building the `_ctypes` module were not available at the time you compiled Python from source.\n\nHere's how you can resolve the problem:\n\n1. **Install the Required Development Packages:**\n\n   For Ubuntu, you need to ensure that the `libffi-dev` package is installed, as it provides the necessary files to compile the `_ctypes` module.\n\n   Open a terminal and run the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install libffi-dev\n   ```\n\n2. **Rebuild Python 3.4.0:**\n\n   Now that you have the required package installed, you can rebuild Python 3.4.0. Navigate to the directory where you have the Python 3.4.0 source code and run the following commands:\n\n   ```bash\n   make clean\n   ./configure\n   make\n   sudo make install\n   ```\n\n   This process will recompile Python and include the `_ctypes` module.\n\n3. **Verify the Installation:**\n\n   After reinstalling, you can verify that the `_ctypes` module is available by starting Python 3.4.0 and trying to import `ctypes`:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.4\n   ```\n\n   Then, within the Python shell, run:\n\n   ```python\n   import ctypes\n   ```\n\n   If you don't encounter any ImportError, the issue should be resolved.\n\nIf you still face issues after following these steps, ensure that there are no conflicts with other Python installations, and that your `PYTHONPATH` and `PATH` environment variables are correctly set to use the newly compiled Python 3.4.0."
