        "content": "Yes, the softmax function can indeed lead to numerical instability, especially when the input values are large, causing `np.exp(x)` to overflow. A numerically stable way to compute the softmax function is by subtracting the maximum value of the input vector from each element of the vector before applying the exponential function. This approach helps in preventing overflow by ensuring that the largest exponent is zero, which reduces the overall scale of the exponentials.\n\nHere's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef stable_softmax(x):\n    # Subtract the maximum value in x from each element of x\n    shift_x = x - np.max(x)\n    # Compute the exponential of the shifted values\n    exp_shifted = np.exp(shift_x)\n    # Compute the softmax by dividing by the sum of the exponentials\n    softmax_values = exp_shifted / np.sum(exp_shifted)\n    return softmax_values\n\n# Example usage\nx = np.array([2.0, 1.0, 0.1])\nsoftmax_values = stable_softmax(x)\nprint(softmax_values)\n```\n\nThis version of the softmax function should mitigate the NaN issues by maintaining numerical stability. By subtracting the maximum value in the array, you ensure that the largest value passed to the exponential function is 0, which prevents the exponential values from becoming too large."
