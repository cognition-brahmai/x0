Here's a simple and delicious recipe for an Apple Tart:\n\n### Ingredients:\n\n#### For the Pastry:\n- 1 \u00bc cups all-purpose flour\n- 1 tablespoon sugar\n- \u00bd teaspoon salt\n- \u00bd cup unsalted butter, chilled and diced\n- 3 to 4 tablespoons ice water\n\n#### For the Filling:\n- 4 to 5 medium apples (such as Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, or your favorite variety)\n- \u00bc cup granulated sugar\n- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted\n- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n- \u00bc teaspoon ground nutmeg (optional)\n- 1 tablespoon lemon juice\n- 2 tablespoons apricot jelly or jam, warmed\n\n### Instructions:\n\n#### For the Pastry:\n1. **Prepare the Dough:**\n   - In a medium bowl, combine flour, sugar, and salt. Add the chilled, diced butter and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to blend until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.\n   - Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, mixing until the dough just comes together. Form into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.\n\n#### For the Filling:\n2. **Prepare the Apples:**\n   - Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n   - Peel, core, and thinly slice the apples. In a bowl, toss the apple slices with sugar, melted butter, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice until well coated.\n\n#### Assemble the Tart:\n3. **Roll Out the Dough:**\n   - On a lightly floured surface, roll out the chilled dough into a circle about 12 inches in diameter. Carefully transfer it to a tart pan, pressing it into the bottom and sides. Trim any excess dough.\n\n4. **Arrange the Apples:**\n   - Starting from the outside edge, arrange the apple slices in concentric circles over the crust, overlapping slightly. Continue until the entire crust is covered.\n\n5. **Bake the Tart:**\n   - Bake in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes or until the apples are tender and the crust is golden brown.\n\n6. **Finish with Glaze:**\n   - Brush the warmed apricot jelly or jam over the baked apples for a glossy finish. Allow the tart to cool slightly before serving.\n\n### Serve:\n- Slice the tart and serve warm or at room temperature. It pairs beautifully with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.\n\nEnjoy your homemade apple tart!"
