Here is my Dockerfile:\n\n```\n#get python\nFROM python:3.6-slim\n\nRUN pip install --trusted-host pypi.python.org flask\n\n#get openjdk\nFROM openjdk:slim\n\nCOPY . /targetdir\nWORKDIR /targetdir\n\n# Make port 81 available to the world outside this container\nEXPOSE 81\n\nCMD [\"python\", \"test.py\"]\n```\n\nHowever, when I try to run it, I get the following error: \n\n```\nD:\\MyApps\\Docker Toolbox\\Docker Toolbox\\docker.exe: Error response from daemon: OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:348: starting container process caused \"exec: \\\"python\\\": executable file not found in $PATH\": unknown.\n```\n\nThe Python script is located in the same directory and looks like this:\n\n```\nfrom flask import Flask\n\nimport os\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route(\"/\")\n\ndef hello():\n    html = \"&lt;h3&gt;Test:{test}&lt;/h3&gt;\"\n    test = os.environ['JAVA_HOME']\n\n    return html.format(test = test)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True,host='0.0.0.0',port=81)\n```\n\nMy goal is to run a Python program that executes a Java file, and the Python library I'm using requires the path to `JAVA_HOME`. However, I do not know Java, my entire code is in Python, and the Python wrapper runs the file the way I need it to. What am I doing wrong here?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that your Dockerfile is using two `FROM` statements, which creates two separate layers, each with its own base image. When you use a second `FROM` statement, it starts a completely new build stage and won't have access to anything installed in the previous stage. In the final image, only the contents from the last `FROM` statement are included. \n\nTo have both Python and Java in the same Docker container, you need to install both in a single base image. You can use a single base image and install both Python and Java in it, or you can use a multi-stage build to copy artifacts from one stage to another. Since you want to execute both Python and Java in the same environment, here's an updated Dockerfile that installs both:\n\n```dockerfile\n# Base image with both Python and Java\nFROM openjdk:11-slim AS base\n\n# Install Python\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip && \\\n    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\n# Install Python dependencies\nRUN pip3 install --trusted-host pypi.python.org flask\n\n# Set JAVA_HOME environment variable\nENV JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64\n\n# Copy application code to /targetdir inside the container\nCOPY . /targetdir\nWORKDIR /targetdir\n\n# Make port 81 available to the world outside this container\nEXPOSE 81\n\n# Run the Python application\nCMD [\"python3\", \"test.py\"]\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Base Image:** We start with an `openjdk` image and then install Python and pip on top of it. This way, both Java and Python are available in the same environment.\n2. **Python Installation:** We install Python 3 and pip using the package manager.\n3. **Use `python3`:** Ensure you are calling `python3` in the `CMD` directive since that's what is installed.\n4. **Set `JAVA_HOME`:** Define the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable, which is often required by Java applications.\n\n### Running Your Container:\n1. Save the updated Dockerfile.\n2. Build the Docker image with the command:\n   ```bash\n   docker build -t my-python-java-app .\n   ```\n3. Run the Docker container with the command:\n   ```bash\n   docker run -p 81:81 my-python-java-app\n   ```\n\nThis setup allows both Python and Java to coexist in the same Docker container, enabling your Python script to call Java as needed."
