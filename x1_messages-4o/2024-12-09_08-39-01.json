        "content": "To extract email addresses that belong to a specific domain from a text file, you can use Python along with regular expressions (regex). The `re` module in Python is perfect for pattern matching tasks like this. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you achieve this:\n\n1. **Read the File**: Open and read the contents of your text file.\n2. **Use Regular Expressions**: Use a regex pattern to find all email addresses that match the specified domain.\n3. **Store the Results**: Collect all matches in a list.\n\nHere's a Python script that implements these steps:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Define the domain you are interested in\ntarget_domain = \"domain.com\"\n\n# Create a regex pattern to match email addresses within <>\npattern = rf'<([a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@{re.escape(target_domain)})>'\n\n# Open and read the file\nwith open('yourfile.txt', 'r') as file:\n    content = file.read()\n\n# Find all email addresses that match the pattern\nemail_addresses = re.findall(pattern, content)\n\n# Print or use the list of email addresses\nprint(email_addresses)\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- `re.escape(target_domain)`: Escapes the domain string to ensure any special characters are treated literally in the regex pattern.\n- `rf'<([a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@{re.escape(target_domain)})>'`: This regex pattern matches any email address within angle brackets that ends with the specified domain.\n  - `<` and `>`: Ensure the email is enclosed within these brackets.\n  - `[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+`: Matches the local part of the email address (before the @) which can contain letters, numbers, and some special characters.\n  - `@{re.escape(target_domain)}`: Matches the @ symbol followed by the specific domain name.\n- `re.findall`: Returns all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string as a list.\n\nThis script will read the file, search for all email addresses with the specified domain enclosed in `<>`, and store them in the `email_addresses` list. Make sure to replace `'yourfile.txt'` with the actual path to your text file."
