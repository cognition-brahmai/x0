It includes properties for the item's name, price, and quantity:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nclass GroceryItem {\n    var name: String\n    var price: Double\n    var quantity: Int\n\n    init(name: String, price: Double, quantity: Int) {\n        self.name = name\n        self.price = price\n        self.quantity = quantity\n    }\n    \n    func totalPrice() -> Double {\n        return price * Double(quantity)\n    }\n    \n    func description() -> String {\n        return \"Item: \\(name), Price: \\(price), Quantity: \\(quantity), Total Price: \\(totalPrice())\"\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nlet apple = GroceryItem(name: \"Apple\", price: 0.5, quantity: 10)\nprint(apple.description())\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Properties**: The class has three properties: `name` (a `String`), `price` (a `Double`), and `quantity` (an `Int`).\n- **Initializer**: The initializer sets these properties when a new instance of `GroceryItem` is created.\n- **Methods**:\n  - `totalPrice()`: Calculates and returns the total price for the item based on its price and quantity.\n  - `description()`: Provides a string representation of the grocery item, including its total price.\n\nYou can create instances of this class to represent different grocery items in your store."
