I have a question regarding the location of the generated c code. Is there a way to specify where this generated c code is written to? I am asking because I don't want my repository to be filled with generated code. For instance, when I run this setup.py file, it writes a file called example.c to the current working directory.\n\n```python\nfrom distutils.core import setup\nfrom Cython.Build import cythonize\n\nsetup(\n      ext_modules = cythonize(\"example.pyx\"))\n```"

        "content": "When using Cython with `distutils` to compile `.pyx` files to C, the generated C files are indeed written to the current working directory by default. However, you can control where these files are generated using the `build` directory options.\n\nTo specify a different directory for the generated C files, you can use the `build` command options in your `setup.py` script. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Specify the `build` directory**: Use the `build` command to set the `build` base directory and the `build_temp` directory to control where temporary files are placed.\n\n2. **Configure `build_ext` options**: You can further specify `build_ext` options to set the directory for the compiled extension modules.\n\nHere's how you can set it up in your `setup.py`:\n\n```python\nfrom distutils.core import setup\nfrom Cython.Build import cythonize\nfrom distutils.command.build import build as build_orig\nfrom distutils.command.build_ext import build_ext as build_ext_orig\n\nclass build(build_orig):\n    def finalize_options(self):\n        build_orig.finalize_options(self)\n        self.build_base = 'build_directory'  # Specify your desired build directory\n\nclass build_ext(build_ext_orig):\n    def finalize_options(self):\n        build_ext_orig.finalize_options(self)\n        self.build_temp = 'build_directory/temp'  # Specify your desired temporary directory\n        self.build_lib = 'build_directory/lib'   # Specify your desired library directory\n\nsetup(\n    cmdclass={\n        'build': build,\n        'build_ext': build_ext,\n    },\n    ext_modules=cythonize(\"example.pyx\"),\n)\n```\n\nIn this example, replace `'build_directory'` with the path where you want to store the generated files. The `build_temp` and `build_lib` are for temporary build files and the final output directories, respectively.\n\nBy configuring these options, you can keep your repository clean and have all build-related files stored in a separate directory."
