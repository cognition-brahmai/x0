        "content": "The issue you're encountering can be attributed to a few potential causes, and there are several steps you can take to resolve it:\n\n1. **Upgrade `pip`, `setuptools`, and `wheel`:**\n   Your `pip` version is quite outdated. Upgrading it along with `setuptools` and `wheel` can resolve many installation issues. Use the following command to upgrade them:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel\n   ```\n\n2. **Use `sudo -H`:**\n   The warning messages indicate potential permission issues. When using `sudo`, it's often recommended to use the `-H` flag to set the home directory for the root user. Try running:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo -H pip install -U scipy\n   ```\n\n3. **Install Precompiled Binaries:**\n   Building `scipy` from source can be resource-intensive and time-consuming. Consider using a precompiled binary instead. If you're using Python 2.7, you might face issues with older versions. Using Python 3 is recommended if feasible. You can try using a package manager like `conda`:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install python3-scipy\n   ```\n\n   Or, if you prefer using `pip`:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo -H pip install --only-binary :all: scipy\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for Dependencies:**\n   `scipy` requires several dependencies, including `numpy`. Ensure that you have `numpy` installed and updated:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo -H pip install numpy\n   ```\n\n5. **Use a Virtual Environment:**\n   It is generally a good practice to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts and permission issues. Create and activate a virtual environment, then try installing `scipy`:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n   pip install -U scipy\n   ```\n\n6. **Address SSL Warnings:**\n   The `InsecurePlatformWarning` indicates that your current Python environment does not have a secure SSL context. This might not directly cause the freeze, but updating your Python and its SSL packages could help:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install libssl-dev\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the installation issue. If the problem persists, consider checking the system logs or output for more specific error messages, as they can provide further clues on what might be going wrong."
