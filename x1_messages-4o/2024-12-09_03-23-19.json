        "content": "Yes, there is a more straightforward way to get the current year and month using the `datetime` module in Python. You can utilize the `datetime` class directly to extract the year and month without the need to format and then parse them back. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Get the current date and time\nnow = datetime.now()\n\n# Extract the year and month\nyear = now.year\nmonth = now.month\n\n# Combine them if needed\ncurrent_year_month = f\"{year}-{month:02}\"\n\nprint(current_year_month)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `datetime.now()` retrieves the current date and time.\n- `now.year` and `now.month` directly give you the current year and month, respectively.\n- The `f-string` format `f\"{year}-{month:02}\"` ensures that the month is always in a two-digit format, for example, `2023-09` for September 2023."
