I understand how radix sort works, but I am unsure of how to implement the parallel version of it. In the assignment, we are given two arrays - an array of values and an array of positions. We have to sort the array of values using a parallelized radix sort and also set the positions correctly. This is the template provided:\n\n```cpp\n//Udacity HW 4\n//Radix Sorting\n\n#include \"reference_calc.cpp\"\n#include \"utils.h\"\n\n/* Red Eye Removal\n   ===============\n\n   For this assignment we are implementing red eye removal.  This is\n   accomplished by first creating a score for every pixel that tells us how\n   likely it is to be a red eye pixel.  We have already done this for you - you\n   are receiving the scores and need to sort them in ascending order so that we\n   know which pixels to alter to remove the red eye.\n\n   Note: ascending order == smallest to largest\n\n   Each score is associated with a position, when you sort the scores, you must\n   also move the positions accordingly.\n\n   Implementing Parallel Radix Sort with CUDA\n   ==========================================\n\n   The basic idea is to construct a histogram on each pass of how many of each\n   \"digit\" there are.   Then we scan this histogram so that we know where to put\n   the output of each digit.  For example, the first 1 must come after all the\n   0s so we have to know how many 0s there are to be able to start moving 1s\n   into the correct position.\n\n   1) Histogram of the number of occurrences of each digit\n   2) Exclusive Prefix Sum of Histogram\n   3) Determine relative offset of each digit\n        For example [0 0 1 1 0 0 1]\n                ->  [0 1 0 1 2 3 2]\n   4) Combine the results of steps 2 & 3 to determine the final\n      output location for each element and move it there\n\n   LSB Radix sort is an out-of-place sort and you will need to ping-pong values\n   between the input and output buffers we have provided.  Make sure the final\n   sorted results end up in the output buffer!  Hint: You may need to do a copy\n   at the end.\n\n */\n\n\nvoid your_sort(unsigned int* const d_inputVals,\n               unsigned int* const d_inputPos,\n               unsigned int* const d_outputVals,\n               unsigned int* const d_outputPos,\n               const size_t numElems)\n{\n\n}\n```\nI am supposed to create a histogram of the \"digits\" and then perform various steps on this histogram to sort the array. I am unsure of how these steps work to sort the array. Could you explain how to implement a parallel radix sort based on the given template?"

        "content": "Implementing a parallel radix sort using CUDA involves several key steps, as outlined in the template comments. Let's break down the process and outline the implementation for each step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Implementation\n\n1. **Determine the Number of Bits and Passes**:\n   - Radix sort works by sorting the input based on individual digits or bits in passes. For simplicity, you can process a fixed number of bits at a time, such as 1 bit or 4 bits.\n\n2. **Histogram Calculation**:\n   - For each pass, compute how many numbers fall into each bucket (e.g., 0 and 1 if processing one bit at a time).\n   - Use atomic operations to update the histogram in parallel.\n\n3. **Exclusive Prefix Sum (Scan)**:\n   - Compute the starting index for each bucket using an exclusive prefix sum over the histogram. This tells us where each number should go in the output array.\n\n4. **Reorder the Elements**:\n   - Using the prefix sum, determine the new position of each element.\n   - You might need to handle this reordering in a way that preserves the relative order within each bucket. This is often achieved by keeping a local count for each thread/block.\n\n5. **Ping-Pong Buffers**:\n   - Since radix sort is out-of-place, you will alternate between two arrays (ping-pong buffering) for input and output in each pass.\n\n6. **Finalize the Result**:\n   - Ensure that after the final pass, the sorted data is in the correct output array.\n\n### Implementation Outline\n\nHere's a rough outline of how you might implement each step in CUDA:\n\n```cpp\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n#include <thrust/scan.h>\n#include <thrust/device_vector.h>\n\n__global__ void histogramKernel(unsigned int* d_inputVals, unsigned int* d_histogram, int bit, size_t numElems) {\n    int idx = blockDim.x * blockIdx.x + threadIdx.x;\n    if (idx >= numElems) return;\n    \n    unsigned int mask = 1 << bit;\n    unsigned int bucket = (d_inputVals[idx] & mask) ? 1 : 0;\n    \n    atomicAdd(&d_histogram[bucket], 1);\n}\n\n__global__ void reorderKernel(unsigned int* d_inputVals, unsigned int* d_inputPos,\n                              unsigned int* d_outputVals, unsigned int* d_outputPos,\n                              unsigned int* d_scanOutput, int bit, size_t numElems) {\n    int idx = blockDim.x * blockIdx.x + threadIdx.x;\n    if (idx >= numElems) return;\n    \n    unsigned int mask = 1 << bit;\n    unsigned int bucket = (d_inputVals[idx] & mask) ? 1 : 0;\n    \n    unsigned int pos = atomicAdd(&d_scanOutput[bucket], 1);\n    d_outputVals[pos] = d_inputVals[idx];\n    d_outputPos[pos] = d_inputPos[idx];\n}\n\nvoid your_sort(unsigned int* const d_inputVals,\n               unsigned int* const d_inputPos,\n               unsigned int* const d_outputVals,\n               unsigned int* const d_outputPos,\n               const size_t numElems) {\n    const int numBits = 32; // Total bits in an unsigned int\n    const int bitsPerPass = 1; // Process 1 bit at a time\n\n    unsigned int* d_histogram;\n    cudaMalloc(&d_histogram, 2 * sizeof(unsigned int)); // Two buckets: 0 and 1\n\n    unsigned int* d_scanOutput;\n    cudaMalloc(&d_scanOutput, 2 * sizeof(unsigned int));\n\n    for (int bit = 0; bit < numBits; bit += bitsPerPass) {\n        cudaMemset(d_histogram, 0, 2 * sizeof(unsigned int));\n\n        // Step 1: Compute histogram\n        histogramKernel<<<(numElems + 255) / 256, 256>>>(d_inputVals, d_histogram, bit, numElems);\n\n        // Step 2: Exclusive prefix sum (scan)\n        thrust::device_ptr<unsigned int> d_histogram_ptr(d_histogram);\n        thrust::device_ptr<unsigned int> d_scanOutput_ptr(d_scanOutput);\n        thrust::exclusive_scan(d_histogram_ptr, d_histogram_ptr + 2, d_scanOutput_ptr);\n\n        // Step 3: Reorder based on prefix sum\n        reorderKernel<<<(numElems + 255) / 256, 256>>>(d_inputVals, d_inputPos, d_outputVals, d_outputPos, d_scanOutput, bit, numElems);\n\n        // Swap input and output arrays for the next iteration\n        std::swap(d_inputVals, d_outputVals);\n        std::swap(d_inputPos, d_outputPos);\n    }\n\n    // Ensure final output is in d_outputVals\n    if ((numBits / bitsPerPass) % 2 == 1) {\n        cudaMemcpy(d_outputVals, d_inputVals, numElems * sizeof(unsigned int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice);\n        cudaMemcpy(d_outputPos, d_inputPos, numElems * sizeof(unsigned int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice);\n    }\n\n    cudaFree(d_histogram);\n    cudaFree(d_scanOutput);\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Histogram Kernel**: This kernel calculates how many elements fall into each bucket (0 and 1 for each bit) and uses atomic operations to update the histogram.\n  \n- **Scan with Thrust**: The exclusive scan computes the starting index positions for each bucket. Thrust library functions are used for this operation.\n\n- **Reorder Kernel**: This kernel places each element into its correct position based on the scan output and processes one bit at a time.\n\n- **Ping-Pong Buffer**: Alternates between input and output arrays in each pass to ensure that the final sorted array is in `d_outputVals`.\n\nThis implementation focuses on simplicity by processing one bit at a time. It can be optimized further by processing more bits in each pass, reducing the number of passes needed. This requires adjusting the histogram and scan steps to handle more buckets per pass."
