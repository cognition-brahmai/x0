        "content": "The error message you're encountering indicates that the `curl-config` script is not found on your system. This script is part of the development package for the `libcurl` library, which is required for building the `pycurl` Python module.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to install the development package for `libcurl`. Here's how you can do it depending on your operating system:\n\n### On Ubuntu/Debian:\n\nYou can install the `libcurl` development package using the following command:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev\n```\n\n### On CentOS/RHEL:\n\nYou can install the `libcurl` development package using the following command:\n\n```bash\nsudo yum install libcurl-devel\n```\n\n### On macOS:\n\nIf you are using Homebrew, you can install `curl` with:\n\n```bash\nbrew install curl\n```\n\nYou might also need to link the package or ensure that Homebrew's `curl` is being used, so you can try:\n\n```bash\nbrew link --force curl\n```\n\nOnce you have installed the appropriate package for your operating system, try running the `pip install pycurl` command again:\n\n```bash\nsudo pip install pycurl\n```\n\nThis should resolve the error and allow you to successfully install the `pycurl` module."
