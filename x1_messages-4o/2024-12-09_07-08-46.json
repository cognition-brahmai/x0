        "content": "Starting with Python 3.3, the hashing algorithm is non-deterministically salted to avoid a certain kind of attack. This is helpful for webservers but it can cause issues when trying to debug a program, as every time I run the script, dictionary contents are iterated in a different order. Earlier versions of Python had a -R flag for enabling hash randomization, but now that it's the default behavior, the flag has not been replaced by its opposite. Randomization can be disabled by setting the environment variable PYTHONHASHSEED. However, this variable must be set before launching the python process. I've tried to set it with os.putenv(), or in os.environ, but these seem to not affect the hashing method. Is there a way for a Python program to disable its own hash randomization?"

        "content": "In Python, the hash randomization behavior is determined at the start of the interpreter process and cannot be changed during runtime. This is why using `os.putenv()` or modifying `os.environ` within a running Python script does not affect the hash randomization for that script.\n\nTo control hash randomization behavior for debugging or other purposes, you can set the `PYTHONHASHSEED` environment variable before starting the Python interpreter. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Set the Environment Variable in the Shell**: Before launching your Python script, set `PYTHONHASHSEED` to a fixed integer value. For example:\n   - In a Unix-like shell (bash, zsh, etc.):\n     ```bash\n     export PYTHONHASHSEED=0\n     python your_script.py\n     ```\n   - In Windows Command Prompt:\n     ```cmd\n     set PYTHONHASHSEED=0\n     python your_script.py\n     ```\n\n2. **Use a Wrapper Script**: If you frequently need to run Python scripts with a fixed hash seed, you could create a small shell or batch script that sets the environment variable and then calls Python. For example:\n   - On Unix-like systems, you might create a script called `run_with_fixed_hash.sh`:\n     ```bash\n     #!/bin/bash\n     export PYTHONHASHSEED=0\n     python \"$@\"\n     ```\n   - On Windows, create a batch file `run_with_fixed_hash.bat`:\n     ```batch\n     @echo off\n     set PYTHONHASHSEED=0\n     python %*\n     ```\n\n3. **Using a Python Launcher Script**: If you need to programmatically set the environment variable and then launch another Python process from within a Python script, you can do so using the `subprocess` module:\n   ```python\n   import os\n   import subprocess\n   import sys\n\n   # Set the PYTHONHASHSEED environment variable\n   os.environ['PYTHONHASHSEED'] = '0'\n\n   # Relaunch the script with the new environment\n   subprocess.Popen([sys.executable] + sys.argv, env=os.environ)\n   ```\n\nBy using these methods, you can effectively control the hash randomization behavior for your Python scripts."
