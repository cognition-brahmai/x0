        "content": "Yes, complex numbers are indeed a supported data type in Python. In Python, complex numbers are represented using the `complex` class, and they can be created by either using the `complex(real, imag)` constructor or by directly writing a number in the form `a + bj`, where `a` is the real part and `b` is the imaginary part.\n\nHere's how you can use complex numbers in Python:\n\n1. **Creating Complex Numbers:**\n\n   - Using the `complex()` function:\n     ```python\n     z = complex(3, 4)  # Creates a complex number 3 + 4j\n     ```\n   - Using the `a + bj` notation:\n     ```python\n     z = 3 + 4j  # Directly creates a complex number 3 + 4j\n     ```\n\n2. **Accessing Real and Imaginary Parts:**\n\n   You can access the real and imaginary parts of a complex number using the `.real` and `.imag` attributes.\n\n   ```python\n   z = 3 + 4j\n   real_part = z.real  # 3.0\n   imag_part = z.imag  # 4.0\n   ```\n\n3. **Basic Operations:**\n\n   Python supports basic arithmetic operations with complex numbers such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n   ```python\n   z1 = 3 + 4j\n   z2 = 1 + 2j\n\n   addition = z1 + z2       # (4+6j)\n   subtraction = z1 - z2    # (2+2j)\n   multiplication = z1 * z2 # (-5+10j)\n   division = z1 / z2       # (2.2-0.4j)\n   ```\n\n4. **Conjugate of a Complex Number:**\n\n   The conjugate of a complex number can be obtained using the `.conjugate()` method.\n\n   ```python\n   z = 3 + 4j\n   conjugate_z = z.conjugate()  # (3-4j)\n   ```\n\n5. **Complex Functions:**\n\n   Python\u2019s `cmath` module provides various functions for complex numbers, such as `cmath.sqrt()`, `cmath.exp()`, `cmath.log()`, and trigonometric functions like `cmath.sin()`, `cmath.cos()`, etc.\n\n   ```python\n   import cmath\n\n   z = 3 + 4j\n   sqrt_z = cmath.sqrt(z)  # Calculates the square root of a complex number\n   ```\n\nComplex numbers are quite useful in various fields such as engineering, physics, and applied mathematics where complex number computations are frequent."
