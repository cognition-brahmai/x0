I have a function with an argument `NBins` that could either be a scalar, like `50`, or an array, like `[0, 10, 20, 30]`. I've attempted to use `len()` to find out the length of `NBins`, but it throws a `TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()` when `NBins` is a scalar, as shown below:\n\n```python\n>>> N=[2,3,5]\n>>> P = 5\n>>> len(N)\n3\n>>> len(P)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nTypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()\n>>> \n```\n\nIs there a function in Python similar to `isarray` or `isscalar` that I can use to identify whether `NBins` is a scalar or an array?"

        "content": "In Python, you can distinguish between a scalar and an array (or list) by checking the type of the variable. You can use the `isinstance()` function to determine whether `NBins` is a list or a scalar. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef check_nbins_type(NBins):\n    if isinstance(NBins, list):\n        print(\"NBins is an array (list) with length:\", len(NBins))\n    elif isinstance(NBins, (int, float)):\n        print(\"NBins is a scalar with value:\", NBins)\n    else:\n        print(\"NBins is of an unknown type\")\n\n# Examples\nN = [0, 10, 20, 30]\nP = 50\n\ncheck_nbins_type(N)\ncheck_nbins_type(P)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- `isinstance(NBins, list)` checks if `NBins` is a list (an array).\n- `isinstance(NBins, (int, float))` checks if `NBins` is a scalar, specifically an integer or a floating-point number.\n- You can extend the checks to include other types if needed.\n\nThis way, you can determine whether `NBins` is a list or a scalar and handle them accordingly."
