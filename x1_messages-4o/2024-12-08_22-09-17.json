        "content": "To accomplish this task, we will first need a table containing several words arranged in different rows. Let's assume the table is as follows:\n\n| Row 1      | Row 2      | Row 3      |\n|------------|------------|------------|\n| Sun        | Book       | Garden     |\n| Moon       | Light      | Water      |\n| Star       | House      | Forest     |\n| Sky        | Road       | Mountain   |\n| Earth      | Window     | River      |\n\nThe objective is to create ten new words by combining one word from each row, ensuring that these combinations make sense and meet the minimum frequency criterion in a large corpus of English language. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Sunlightgarden** - The combination of \"Sun,\" \"Light,\" and \"Garden\" could refer to a garden that thrives under sunlight.\n2. **Moonhousewater** - The combination of \"Moon,\" \"House,\" and \"Water\" could suggest a house located by a body of water that reflects moonlight.\n3. **Starlightriver** - The combination of \"Star,\" \"Light,\" and \"River\" could depict a river that reflects the light of the stars.\n4. **Skylightforest** - This combination of \"Sky,\" \"Light,\" and \"Forest\" could describe a forest illuminated by the sky's light.\n5. **Earthroadmountain** - The combination of \"Earth,\" \"Road,\" and \"Mountain\" could refer to a mountain path that is earthy and rugged.\n6. **Moonwindowgarden** - This combination of \"Moon,\" \"Window,\" and \"Garden\" could represent a garden that can be viewed through a window under moonlight.\n7. **Starhousemountain** - The combination of \"Star,\" \"House,\" and \"Mountain\" could denote a house situated on a mountain with a clear view of the stars.\n8. **Sunroadforest** - The combination of \"Sun,\" \"Road,\" and \"Forest\" could describe a sunlit road through a forest.\n9. **Earthwindowriver** - This combination of \"Earth,\" \"Window,\" and \"River\" could suggest a window view of a river surrounded by earthy landscapes.\n10. **Skylightriver** - This combination of \"Sky,\" \"Light,\" and \"River\" could describe a river that is illuminated by the sky.\n\nThese new words are hypothetical and created for the purpose of this exercise. In reality, verifying their frequency in a large corpus would require access to extensive linguistic databases."
