When I attempt to run simple code on Sublime Text 3, I receive the following message: \"Python was not found but can be installed from the Microsoft Store: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?linkID=2082640\". Moreover, when I enter 'python' in the Command Prompt, it redirects me to the Windows Store for downloading Python 3.7. This issue began unexpectedly today despite not making any changes or downloads related to Python. I have already tried reinstalling Python and ensured the Path environment variable is correct, but the problem persists. What could be causing this and how can I resolve it?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is likely due to the way Windows handles the `python` command when it is not properly configured in the system PATH, or when there's a misconfiguration in the PATH environment variables. Here are several steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify Python Installation:**\n   - Ensure that Python is correctly installed on your system. You can check this by going to the directory where Python is installed (usually `C:\\Python39` for Python 3.9, for example) and verifying that the Python executable files are present.\n\n2. **Check Environment Variables:**\n   - Open the Start Menu and search for \"Environment Variables\".\n   - Click on \"Edit the system environment variables\".\n   - In the System Properties window, click on the \"Environment Variables\" button.\n   - Under \"System variables\", find the \"Path\" variable and click \"Edit\".\n   - Ensure that the path to the Python executable (e.g., `C:\\Python39\\`) and the path to the `Scripts` directory (e.g., `C:\\Python39\\Scripts\\`) are included in the list. If not, add them.\n\n3. **Default App Associations:**\n   - Sometimes, Windows might have associated the `python` command with the Microsoft Store app. You can reset this by:\n     - Going to \"Settings\" > \"Apps\" > \"Default apps\".\n     - Scroll down and click on \"Choose default apps by file type\".\n     - Look for `.py` and ensure it is associated with your installed Python executable, not the Microsoft Store.\n\n4. **Reinstall Python:**\n   - Uninstall Python completely from your system.\n   - Download the latest version of Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n   - During installation, make sure to check the box that says \"Add Python to PATH\".\n\n5. **Use Python Launcher:**\n   - Python Launcher for Windows (py.exe) is a utility that can help manage multiple Python versions. You can try using `py` instead of `python` in the command prompt to see if it correctly identifies your installed Python version.\n\n6. **Check for Conflicting Software:**\n   - Ensure there are no other software or scripts that might be interfering with the Python command. This includes checking for aliases or batch scripts that might redirect the command.\n\n7. **Command Prompt Restart:**\n   - After making changes to environment variables, restart any open Command Prompt windows to ensure the changes take effect.\n\nBy following the above steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and have the `python` command work correctly from the Command Prompt and Sublime Text."
