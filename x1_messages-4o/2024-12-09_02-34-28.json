        "content": "You can determine the version of the Python interpreter that is running your script by using the `sys` module, which provides access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter. Here\u2019s a simple way to find out the version:\n\n1. **Using the `sys` module:**\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   print(\"Python version\")\n   print(sys.version)\n   print(\"Version info.\")\n   print(sys.version_info)\n   ```\n\n   This code will output the version of Python along with additional information about the version components.\n\n2. **Using the `platform` module:**\n\n   If you want a more readable version string, you can use the `platform` module:\n\n   ```python\n   import platform\n   print(platform.python_version())\n   ```\n\n   This will give you a string with the version number, such as `3.8.5`.\n\nBoth methods are effective, and you can use either depending on your preference for the format of the output."
