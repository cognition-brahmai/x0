Let's organize the berry smoothie ingredients using a narrative approach, creating a story that embeds all the necessary details:\n\n---\n\nIn the heart of the kitchen, the Berry Smoothie Symphony was about to begin. The conductor of this fruity orchestra, a vibrant Strawberry, stood at the helm, weighing in at a sweet 100 grams. It was fresh and ready to lead the ensemble with its juicy notes.\n\nNext to Strawberry, the subtle Blueberry section, modest yet essential, brought 80 grams of its frozen charm. These little spheres of flavor were like tiny cymbals, adding a crisp chill to the melody.\n\nThe Blackberry brigade, with their deep, rich tones, contributed 70 grams of fresh delight. They were the string instruments, offering a smooth and mellow base to the composition.\n\nNearby, the Raspberry quartet, with their 60 grams of frozen wonder, provided a tart harmony. They were the brass section, sharp and bold, cutting through with their vibrant zing.\n\nThe sweet Banana, 90 grams of fresh goodness, entered the scene as the woodwind section. It brought a creamy, smooth undertone, binding the flavors together.\n\nA touch of Honey, 20 grams, acted like the conductor's baton, subtly guiding the performance with its sticky sweetness. It was neither fresh nor frozen but essential for the rhythm.\n\nFinally, the Almond Milk, flowing in at 150 grams, served as the stage itself. It held the entire ensemble, fresh and silky, allowing each ingredient to shine.\n\nThus, the Berry Smoothie Symphony played on, each ingredient contributing its unique note to create a harmonious blend of flavors.\n\n---\n\nIn this narrative, each ingredient is characterized by its weight, state (fresh or frozen), and its role in the \"symphony,\" providing an engaging way to remember the components without using a list or table."
