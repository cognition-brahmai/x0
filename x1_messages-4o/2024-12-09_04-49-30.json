This error doesn't occur when the xlabel method is used. The string value in xlabel works perfectly fine and my plot prints. Can someone help me understand why this happens? The code I've used is as follows:\n\n```python\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\n<ipython-input-85-5a3cfeebed52> in <module>()\n      4 plt.grid(False)\n      5 #plt.ylabel('Relative Search Freq')\n----> 6 plt.ylabel('This is the Y Label')\n      7 plt.xlabel('This is the X Label')\n      8 plt.legend()\n\nTypeError: 'str' object is not callable\n```\n\nThe plot does print but it doesn't include the ylabel or any of the code after the error, which seems like normal behavior. What could be causing this issue?"

        "content": "The `TypeError: 'str' object is not callable` in your code is likely due to a name conflict. This usually happens when a variable name in your script is the same as the name of a function or module you are trying to use, effectively overwriting the function or module with a string (or another data type).\n\nIn your case, it seems like there might be a variable named `ylabel` defined somewhere in your code or environment as a string, which is shadowing the `plt.ylabel` function from `matplotlib.pyplot`.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can troubleshoot and fix this issue:\n\n1. **Check for Variable Name Conflicts**: Look through your code and see if you have inadvertently assigned a string or any other value to a variable named `ylabel`. If you find such a variable, rename it to something else.\n\n2. **Restart Your Kernel/Environment**: Sometimes, especially in Jupyter notebooks, a variable from a previous cell execution may persist. Restarting the kernel can help clear these overwritten variables.\n\n3. **Check the Imports**: Ensure that your imports are correct and that `matplotlib.pyplot` is imported as `plt`. Here is a typical import statement:\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n   ```\n\n4. **Scope Check**: If you have defined functions or classes, ensure there are no `ylabel` variables within those scopes that could be causing the conflict.\n\nAfter addressing these points, try running your code again. It should resolve the `TypeError` and allow your plot to display with the correct labels."
