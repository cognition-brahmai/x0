I have been using the math module, specifically the math.cos() function, but it returns the answer in radians. Here's my code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nx = math.cos(1)\ny = x * 180 / math.pi\nprint(y)\n```\n\nThis gives me output `30.9570417874`. However, when I use my calculator set to degrees, the cosine of 1 gives me `0.9998476...`. How can I get the math.cos() function to return an answer in degrees?"

        "content": "The `math.cos()` function in Python's `math` module expects an input in radians and returns a result also in radians. The issue you're facing comes from applying the conversion from radians to degrees to the result of `cos`, which isn't necessary. Here's how you should approach this problem:\n\n1. Convert the angle from degrees to radians before passing it to `math.cos()`.\n2. Use the result directly as it's already in the correct form.\n\nIf you want to compute the cosine of an angle given in degrees, you should first convert the angle from degrees to radians, compute the cosine, and then use it directly if you need the cosine value itself.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Angle in degrees\nangle_degrees = 1\n\n# Convert the angle to radians\nangle_radians = math.radians(angle_degrees)\n\n# Compute the cosine\ncosine_value = math.cos(angle_radians)\n\nprint(cosine_value)\n```\n\nThis will give you the correct result, which is approximately `0.9998476...`, as your calculator shows when it's set to degrees. Remember that the result of `math.cos()` is the cosine value itself, which is unitless, so no further conversion is needed after computing the cosine."
