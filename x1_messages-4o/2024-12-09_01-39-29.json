In the following code, I am raising an \"Exception: a\" first, and then inside the except block, I am raising an \"Exception: b\". However, the output I get is 'Exception: a'. I expected it to be 'Exception: b'. Why is the 'raise' keyword in the 'finally' block raising the original exception rather than the last exception raised? Here is the code:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    raise Exception(\"a\")\nexcept:\n    try:\n        raise Exception(\"b\")\n    finally:\n        raise\n```"

        "content": "In your code, the behavior you're observing is due to how the `raise` statement works in Python, particularly when used without any arguments.\n\nLet's break down what's happening in your code:\n\n1. **First try block:**\n   - You raise `Exception(\"a\")`.\n   - This exception is immediately caught by the outer `except` block.\n\n2. **Nested try-except block:**\n   - Inside the `except` block, you enter another try block, where you raise `Exception(\"b\")`.\n   - This triggers the `finally` block right away because the exception `Exception(\"b\")` was raised.\n\n3. **Finally block:**\n   - The `finally` block contains the statement `raise` with no arguments.\n   - In Python, when `raise` is used without any arguments, it re-raises the last exception that was active in the current scope.\n   - At this point, the last active exception is `Exception(\"a\")`, which was caught by the outer `except` block.\n\nThus, when you execute `raise` in the `finally` block, it re-raises the original exception `Exception(\"a\")` rather than the more recent `Exception(\"b\")`. This is why you observe the output 'Exception: a'.\n\nIf you want to specifically raise the last exception (`Exception(\"b\")`), you would need to handle it differently, for example by capturing it and explicitly raising it again:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    raise Exception(\"a\")\nexcept:\n    try:\n        raise Exception(\"b\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        pass  # Handle or log Exception(\"b\") if needed\n    finally:\n        raise Exception(\"b\")\n```\n\nThis way, you are explicitly raising `Exception(\"b\")` in the `finally` block, which would give you the desired output."
