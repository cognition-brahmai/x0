The code is as follows:\n\n```python\nwith DAG('airflow_tutorial_v01',\n     default_args=default_args,\n     schedule_interval='0 * * * *',\n     ) as dag:\n\n     print_hello = BashOperator(task_id='print_hello',\n                           bash_command='echo \"hello\"')\n     sleep = BashOperator(task_id='sleep',\n                     bash_command='sleep 5')\n     print_world = PythonOperator(task_id='print_world',\n                             python_callable=print_world)\n\n     print_hello >> sleep >> print_world\n```\n\nThe line `print_hello >> sleep >> print_world` confuses me. What does the >> operator mean in this context? I'm aware of its use as a bitwise operator, but can't relate it to the code here."

        "content": "In the context of Apache Airflow, the `>>` operator is used to set dependencies between tasks. \n\nThe line `print_hello >> sleep >> print_world` is a shorthand way to define the order in which tasks should be executed. Specifically, it establishes that the `sleep` task should run after the `print_hello` task, and the `print_world` task should run after the `sleep` task. This can be read as \"print_hello goes to sleep goes to print_world,\" indicating the flow of execution.\n\nThis operator is a part of Airflow's task dependency API, providing a more readable and concise way to define task dependencies compared to the traditional approach of using the `set_downstream()` and `set_upstream()` methods.\n\nSo, in summary:\n- `print_hello` runs first.\n- After `print_hello` completes, `sleep` runs.\n- After `sleep` completes, `print_world` runs."
