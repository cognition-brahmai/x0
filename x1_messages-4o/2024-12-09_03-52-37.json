        "content": "Is there a nosql flat-file database available that operates similarly to sqlite? I'm looking for a database that can be opened in different processes for reading, while maintaining a single process for writing. This would be ideal for a read cache where strict consistency isn't required, with writes to the file or memory block happening every 1-2 seconds and readers receiving updated data thereafter. I was planning on using sqlite for my python server read cache, but I don't want to rewrite sqls in another place and construct another copy of my data tables in sqlite that mimic what I have in my backend PostgreSql database. Are there any alternatives?"

        "content": "Yes, there are several NoSQL flat-file databases that can operate similarly to SQLite, allowing multiple processes to read while maintaining a single process for writing. Here are some possible alternatives:\n\n1. **TinyDB**: TinyDB is a lightweight, document-oriented database that stores data in JSON files. It's designed for small projects and provides a simple API. It supports multiple processes reading from the database, but you would need to manage the single-writer aspect manually.\n\n2. **LevelDB**: Developed by Google, LevelDB is a fast key-value storage library written at Google that offers an ordered mapping from string keys to string values. While it doesn't natively support concurrent writes, you can implement a single-writer model in your application logic.\n\n3. **RocksDB**: A fork of LevelDB by Facebook, RocksDB offers similar functionality with additional features like better performance. Again, you would need to manage concurrent access in your application.\n\n4. **LMDB (Lightning Memory-Mapped Database)**: LMDB is an ultra-fast, memory-mapped key-value database. It supports multiple readers and a single writer, making it suitable for your use case. It's known for its high performance and reliability.\n\n5. **UnQLite**: UnQLite is a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional NoSQL engine. It combines features of both key-value stores and document databases and can be used for lightweight applications.\n\n6. **Berkeley DB**: It's a high-performance, embedded database for key/value data. It supports multiple readers and a single writer.\n\nIn your case, where you aim to mirror some data from a PostgreSQL database without rewriting SQL queries, you may also consider using a caching layer such as:\n\n- **Redis**: Although not a flat-file database, Redis is an in-memory data structure store that can persist data to disk. It's widely used for caching purposes.\n\n- **Memcached**: Another in-memory caching solution that doesn't persist data to disk but can be used for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.\n\nEach of these options has its own strengths and weaknesses, so the best choice depends on your specific requirements regarding performance, persistence, and ease of integration with your existing system."
