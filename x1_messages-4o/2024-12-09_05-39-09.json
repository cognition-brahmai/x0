I have observed that it seems to perform a form of horizontal concatenation, however, I have been unable to find any documentation online. Here is a minimal working example of my code:\n\n```python\nfrom numpy import c_\na = ones(4)\nb = zeros((4,10))    \nc_[a,b]\n```\n\nI have noticed that the output of the above code is:\n\n```python\narray([[ 1.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n       [ 1.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n       [ 1.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],\n       [ 1.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.]])\n```"

        "content": "The `c_` object in NumPy is a special object that simplifies the process of concatenating arrays along the second axis, i.e., horizontally. It is part of NumPy's index tricks and is used for constructing arrays by stacking them column-wise.\n\nIn your example:\n\n```python\nfrom numpy import c_, ones, zeros\na = ones(4)\nb = zeros((4, 10))    \nc_[a, b]\n```\n\nHere's what happens:\n\n1. `a = ones(4)` creates a 1-D array with four elements, all set to 1. So, `a` is `[1., 1., 1., 1.]`.\n\n2. `b = zeros((4, 10))` creates a 2-D array with shape (4, 10), filled with zeros.\n\n3. When you use `c_[a, b]`, the `c_` object interprets `a` as a column vector and concatenates it with `b` along the second axis (column-wise). \n\nThe `c_` object is part of NumPy's \"index tricks,\" which are utilities that facilitate array construction in a MATLAB-like way. It's particularly useful for quickly stacking 1-D and 2-D arrays without having to explicitly reshape them.\n\nIn essence, `c_[a, b]` is equivalent to using `np.column_stack((a[:, np.newaxis], b))`, where `a[:, np.newaxis]` reshapes `a` from shape `(4,)` to `(4, 1)`, making it a column vector, which can then be horizontally concatenated with `b`. The final result is a 2-D array where `a` is added as the first column to `b`."
