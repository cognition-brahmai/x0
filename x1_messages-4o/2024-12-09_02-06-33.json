The documentation does not seem to cover it and I am confused about whether to call it at the end of each worker's code, i.e., inside mp.spawn or outside of mp.spawn, i.e., by the main process. Here's an example of what I mean by the latter:\n\n```python\ndef test_setup():\n    print('test_setup')\n    if torch.cuda.is_available():\n        world_size = torch.cuda.device_count()\n    else:\n        world_size = 4\n    master_port = find_free_port()\n    mp.spawn(setup_process, args=(world_size, master_port), nprocs=world_size)\n    dist.destroy_process_group()\n    print('successful test_setup!')\n```"

        "content": "In PyTorch's distributed training context, the `torch.distributed.destroy_process_group()` function is used to clean up resources that were allocated for a process group. It's important to call this function appropriately to ensure that your distributed processes are terminated cleanly. \n\nThe placement of `destroy_process_group()` depends on how you are managing your processes. Here's a breakdown of how you should typically handle it:\n\n### Inside Each Worker Process\n\nYou should call `torch.distributed.destroy_process_group()` within each worker process after all distributed operations are complete. This means it should be called in the function that each process (spawned by `mp.spawn()`) is executing. This ensures that each process cleans up after itself.\n\nHere's an example of how you might structure your code:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.distributed as dist\nimport torch.multiprocessing as mp\n\ndef setup_process(rank, world_size, master_port):\n    # Initialize the process group\n    dist.init_process_group(\n        backend='nccl' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'gloo',\n        init_method=f'tcp://127.0.0.1:{master_port}',\n        rank=rank,\n        world_size=world_size\n    )\n\n    # Perform distributed operations\n    # Example: print the rank\n    print(f'Rank {rank} is participating in the process group.')\n\n    # Clean up\n    dist.destroy_process_group()\n\ndef test_setup():\n    print('test_setup')\n    if torch.cuda.is_available():\n        world_size = torch.cuda.device_count()\n    else:\n        world_size = 4\n    master_port = find_free_port()\n    mp.spawn(setup_process, args=(world_size, master_port), nprocs=world_size)\n    print('successful test_setup!')\n\ndef find_free_port():\n    import socket\n    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n    s.bind(('', 0))\n    port = s.getsockname()[1]\n    s.close()\n    return port\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    test_setup()\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n1. **Initialization and Cleanup in Worker**: Each worker process is responsible for initializing and destroying the process group. This ensures that all resources are freed properly.\n\n2. **Avoid Main Process Cleanup**: You should not call `destroy_process_group()` in the main process after `mp.spawn()`, since the main process is not part of the process group and it does not participate in distributed operations. Calling it there would typically result in an error or undefined behavior.\n\n3. **Correct Use of `mp.spawn()`**: `mp.spawn()` handles the creation of subprocesses. The `setup_process` function should include all the necessary setup and teardown logic for distributed processing.\n\nBy following this pattern, you can ensure that each of your processes handles its lifecycle correctly, maintaining a clean and efficient execution environment."
