        "content": "Certainly! Here's a simple Scala program that calculates the sum of all natural numbers below 100:\n\n```scala\nobject SumOfNaturalNumbers {\n  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\n    val limit = 100\n    val sum = (1 until limit).sum\n    println(s\"The sum of natural numbers below $limit is: $sum\")\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We define an object `SumOfNaturalNumbers` which contains the `main` method, the entry point of the program.\n- We set `limit` to 100 as we want to calculate the sum of natural numbers below this value.\n- We use Scala's `until` method to create a range from 1 to 99 (since 100 is not included).\n- We apply the `sum` method on this range to compute the sum of all numbers in it.\n- Finally, we print the result."
