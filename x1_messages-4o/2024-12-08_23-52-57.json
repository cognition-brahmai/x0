        "content": "Finding academic journals with both groundbreaking research and a readership of fewer than 1,000 subscribers can be challenging, as impactful research often leads to greater visibility. However, some lesser-known journals, which might not have massive readerships but have published noteworthy research, include:\n\n1. **Quantum Studies: Mathematics and Foundations** - This journal focuses on the foundational aspects of quantum mechanics and often features innovative research that might not immediately gain widespread attention.\n\n2. **Journal of Quantum Information Science** - While not as widely known as some leading journals in the field, it has published significant work on quantum information theory and related topics.\n\n3. **Entropy** - Although this journal covers a broad range of topics, its quantum mechanics section occasionally publishes pioneering studies, and it might have a smaller dedicated readership interested in this niche area.\n\nThese journals may not always have subscriber counts publicly available, but they represent venues where less mainstream yet significant quantum physics research can be found."
