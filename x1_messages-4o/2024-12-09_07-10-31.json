I am working on a piece of code that will open a file, print out the contents on the screen, ask you if you want to edit/delete/etc the contents, do it, and then re-print out the results and ask you for confirmation to save. However, I am stuck at printing the contents of the file. I am not sure what command to use to do this. I am using Python 2.7.4 and Ubuntu 13.04. Can someone help me understand how I can print the content of a .txt file in Python? Here is the piece of code I have written so far:\n\n```python\nfrom sys import argv\n\nscript, filename = argv\nprint \"Who are you?\"\nname = raw_input()\n\nprint \"What file are you looking for today?\"\nfile = raw_input()\n\nprint (file)\n\nprint \"Ok then, here's the file you wanted.\" \n\nprint \"Would you like to delete the contents? Yes or No?\"\n```"

        "content": "To print the contents of a file in Python 2.7, you can use the `open()` function to open the file and then the `read()` method to read its contents. Here's how you can modify your code to print the contents of the file:\n\n```python\nfrom sys import argv\n\nscript, filename = argv\nprint \"Who are you?\"\nname = raw_input()\n\nprint \"What file are you looking for today?\"\nfile = raw_input()\n\n# Open the file in read mode\ntry:\n    with open(file, 'r') as f:\n        # Read the contents of the file\n        file_contents = f.read()\n        \n    print \"Ok then, here's the file you wanted:\"\n    print file_contents  # Print the contents of the file\n\nexcept IOError:\n    print \"Could not open file:\", file\n\nprint \"Would you like to delete the contents? Yes or No?\"\n```\n\nIn this modified version:\n\n- We use `open(file, 'r')` to open the file in read mode (`'r'`).\n- The `with` statement is used to ensure the file is properly closed after its suite finishes.\n- `f.read()` reads the entire contents of the file, which is then stored in `file_contents`.\n- We then print `file_contents` to display the contents of the file.\n- A `try...except` block is used to catch an `IOError` in case the file cannot be opened, which helps in handling errors gracefully."
