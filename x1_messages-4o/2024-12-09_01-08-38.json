I'm able to check for the presence of a value in both data types like this:\n\nFor a dict:\n```python\nif something in dict_of_stuff:\n    pass\n```\n\nFor a list:\n```python\nif something in list_of_stuff:\n    pass\n```\n\nI'm inclined to believe that a dict would be faster and more efficient. I'm using this look up table in the context of solving the Euler Problem 92, where I need to check if a calculated value has already been calculated before. My primary concern is the efficiency of the look up operation. Additionally, there are no values associated with the value, so would a set be a better choice?"

        "content": "For your use case, where you need to efficiently check for the presence of a value in a large collection, a `set` is indeed the best choice. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. **Time Complexity**:\n   - **Set**: The average time complexity for lookups in a set is O(1) because sets in Python are implemented as hash tables.\n   - **Dict**: Similarly, dictionaries also have an average time complexity of O(1) for lookups, since they are also implemented as hash tables.\n   - **List**: In contrast, lists have an average time complexity of O(n) for lookups, because it may need to iterate over each element to find the desired value.\n\n2. **Memory Usage**:\n   - **Set**: Since you don't need to store any values associated with your keys, using a set is more memory efficient than a dictionary, as it only stores the keys.\n   - **Dict**: While dictionaries are efficient for lookups, they store both keys and values, which is unnecessary for your problem.\n   - **List**: Lists are not only slower for lookups but also use more memory for large datasets compared to sets, as they store elements in a contiguous block of memory.\n\n3. **Use Case Suitability**:\n   - Since your task involves checking for the existence of values without associated data, a `set` is semantically the right choice and aligns with your requirement of storing unique items with efficient membership tests.\n\nHere's how you can use a set for your lookup table:\n\n```python\n# Initialize an empty set\nlookup_set = set()\n\n# Add values to the set\nlookup_set.add(some_value)\n\n# Check if a value exists in the set\nif something in lookup_set:\n    pass\n```\n\nThis approach will give you the best performance in terms of both speed and memory usage for your specific use case."
