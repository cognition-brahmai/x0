        "content": "**Physics Problem: Projectile Motion with Air Resistance and Coriolis Effect**\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nA baseball with a mass of 0.145 kg and a diameter of 7.4 cm is launched from the ground at an angle of 45 degrees with an initial velocity of 50 m/s. The projectile's motion is affected by air resistance, which varies with altitude, and the Coriolis effect due to Earth's rotation. The baseball is launched from a location at a latitude of 45 degrees. Assume the gravitational acceleration \\( g = 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\).\n\n**Air Resistance Values:**\n\nThe table below provides the drag coefficient \\( C_d \\) at different altitudes:\n\n| Altitude (m) | \\( C_d \\) |\n|--------------|-----------|\n| 0            | 0.47      |\n| 500          | 0.46      |\n| 1000         | 0.45      |\n| 1500         | 0.44      |\n| 2000         | 0.43      |\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. What is the maximum height reached by the baseball?\n2. How long does it take to reach its maximum height?\n3. What is the horizontal distance traveled by the baseball before hitting the ground?\n4. What is the velocity of the baseball at impact, considering air resistance, the Coriolis effect, and Earth's rotation?\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe solution involves several steps, utilizing the equations of motion, the drag force, and the Coriolis force. We will present the solution in LaTeX format:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\section*{Solution}\n\n\\subsection*{1. Maximum Height}\n\nThe initial velocity components are:\n\\[\nv_{0x} = v_0 \\cos(45^\\circ) = \\frac{50}{\\sqrt{2}} \\, \\text{m/s}\n\\]\n\\[\nv_{0y} = v_0 \\sin(45^\\circ) = \\frac{50}{\\sqrt{2}} \\, \\text{m/s}\n\\]\n\nThe drag force can be expressed as:\n\\[\nF_d = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho v^2 C_d A\n\\]\nwhere \\( A = \\pi \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2 \\) is the cross-sectional area of the baseball.\n\nAssuming the drag force acts primarily in the vertical direction at maximum height, we use the iterative numerical method to find the effect of drag on the vertical motion. For simplicity, we assume constant \\( C_d \\) for small altitude changes.\n\nThe time to reach maximum height \\( t_{\\text{max}} \\) is approximately:\n\\[\nt_{\\text{max}} \\approx \\frac{v_{0y}}{g} = \\frac{\\frac{50}{\\sqrt{2}}}{9.81} \\approx 3.57 \\, \\text{s}\n\\]\n\n\\subsection*{2. Maximum Height}\nThe maximum height \\( h_{\\text{max}} \\) without air resistance is:\n\\[\nh_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{v_{0y}^2}{2g} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{50}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2}{2 \\times 9.81} \\approx 63.7 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nConsidering drag, use numerical integration to adjust for varying \\( C_d \\).\n\n\\subsection*{3. Horizontal Distance}\n\nThe horizontal range \\( R \\) without air resistance is:\n\\[\nR = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2 \\times 45^\\circ)}{g} = \\frac{50^2}{9.81} \\approx 255.1 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nWith air resistance and Coriolis effect, use numerical methods to solve for the exact range.\n\n\\subsection*{4. Velocity at Impact}\n\nThe impact velocity \\( v_{\\text{impact}} \\) can be calculated using energy methods and considering energy loss due to air resistance:\n\\[\nv_{\\text{impact}} = \\sqrt{v_{x}^2 + v_{y}^2}\n\\]\n\nInclude Coriolis corrections:\n\\[\n\\text{Coriolis force} = 2 m v \\Omega \\sin(\\lambda)\n\\]\nwhere \\( \\Omega = 7.2921 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{rad/s} \\) and \\( \\lambda = 45^\\circ \\).\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n**Note:** The precise calculations involving air resistance, Coriolis force, and Earth's rotation typically require computational methods and are simplified here. For accurate results, numerical simulations should be used."
