I am currently using Thrust to copy memory from the host to the device as shown below:\n\n```cpp\nthrust::host_vector<float> h_vec(1 << 28);\nthrust::device_vector<float> d_vec(1 << 28);\nthrust::copy(h_vec.begin(), h_vec.end(), d_vec.begin());\n```\n\nHowever, I want to do this using CUDA streams similar to how you would copy memory from the device to the device as shown:\n\n```cpp\ncudaStream_t s;\ncudaStreamCreate(&s);\n\nthrust::device_vector<float> d_vec1(1 << 28), d_vec2(1 << 28);\nthrust::copy(thrust::cuda::par.on(s), d_vec1.begin(), d_vec1.end(), d_vec2.begin());\n\ncudaStreamSynchronize(s);\ncudaStreamDestroy(s);\n```\n\nThe issue I'm facing is that I can't set the execution policy to CUDA to specify the stream when copying from the host to the device, because in that case, Thrust would assume that both vectors are stored on the device. Is there a workaround for this problem? I'm using the latest Thrust version from GitHub (version 1.8 as specified in the version.h file)."

        "content": "To achieve asynchronous memory transfers from host to device using Thrust and CUDA streams, you'll need to leverage the underlying CUDA API for the actual memory transfer while using Thrust for the host-side vector management. This is because Thrust's `copy` function does not natively support specifying a stream for host-to-device copies.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Allocate the host and device memory using Thrust.\n2. Use CUDA's asynchronous memory copy function (`cudaMemcpyAsync`) to perform the transfer, specifying your stream.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```cpp\n#include <thrust/host_vector.h>\n#include <thrust/device_vector.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\nint main() {\n    // Size of the vector\n    size_t N = 1 << 28;\n\n    // Allocate host and device vectors\n    thrust::host_vector<float> h_vec(N);\n    thrust::device_vector<float> d_vec(N);\n\n    // Initialize CUDA stream\n    cudaStream_t stream;\n    cudaStreamCreate(&stream);\n\n    // Get raw pointers to the data\n    float* h_ptr = h_vec.data();\n    float* d_ptr = thrust::raw_pointer_cast(d_vec.data());\n\n    // Perform asynchronous copy from host to device\n    cudaMemcpyAsync(d_ptr, h_ptr, N * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream);\n\n    // Perform other operations here while the copy is in progress...\n\n    // Synchronize the stream to ensure the copy is completed\n    cudaStreamSynchronize(stream);\n\n    // Clean up the stream\n    cudaStreamDestroy(stream);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Host and Device Vectors:** You allocate vectors using Thrust for ease of use and management.\n- **CUDA Stream:** You create a CUDA stream to manage the asynchronous operations.\n- **Raw Pointers:** Thrust's `device_vector` provides a `raw_pointer_cast` to obtain a raw device pointer. The `host_vector` provides a direct data pointer.\n- **cudaMemcpyAsync:** This function is used to perform the actual memory transfer, specifying the stream.\n- **Synchronization:** Use `cudaStreamSynchronize` to ensure that the transfer is complete before proceeding with any operations that depend on the transferred data.\n\nThis approach gives you the flexibility of Thrust for vector management and the performance advantage of asynchronous memory transfers with CUDA streams."
