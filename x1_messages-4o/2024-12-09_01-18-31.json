In my current code, I run a CUDA kernel at every iteration of a while-loop to do some computation on the values of an array. At each iteration of the while-loop that calls the kernel, I have to sum all values generated within `odata` and save the result in an `int` array called `result`, at a position within such array that corresponds to the current iteration. This operation has to be accomplished inside the kernel or at least still in the GPU due to performance constraints. I am aware of the concept of array reduction using CUDA and the NVIDIA's documentation on the subject, but I am having trouble understanding how to sum-reduce an array to one number if the code actually outputs a full array. Could someone please explain this and show me an example on how to get the one-number result out of the output array?"

        "content": "To perform a sum reduction on an array within the GPU using CUDA, you need to follow a reduction pattern that involves multiple steps to efficiently sum up the elements using parallel threads. The goal is to reduce the array into a single sum efficiently. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n### CUDA Kernel for Sum Reduction\n\nThe reduction process is typically done in the following steps:\n\n1. **Load array elements into shared memory**: This is done to take advantage of the fast access speed of shared memory.\n\n2. **Perform parallel reduction**: Use multiple threads to sum pairs of elements iteratively until you get the total sum.\n\n3. **Store the result**: The result is usually stored in the first element of the block's shared memory or global memory.\n\nHere's a simple example of how you might implement a sum reduction kernel:\n\n```cuda\n__global__ void sumReduction(int *g_idata, int *g_odata, unsigned int n) {\n    extern __shared__ int sdata[];\n\n    // Each thread loads one element from global to shared memory\n    unsigned int tid = threadIdx.x;\n    unsigned int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;\n    if (i < n) {\n        sdata[tid] = g_idata[i];\n    } else {\n        sdata[tid] = 0;\n    }\n    __syncthreads();\n\n    // Do reduction in shared memory\n    for(unsigned int s = blockDim.x / 2; s > 0; s >>= 1) {\n        if (tid < s) {\n            sdata[tid] += sdata[tid + s];\n        }\n        __syncthreads();\n    }\n\n    // Write result for this block to global memory\n    if (tid == 0) {\n        g_odata[blockIdx.x] = sdata[0];\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Host Code\n\nYou can then call this kernel from your host code. Note that you might need to call the kernel multiple times if your data does not fit into a single block.\n\n```cpp\nint main() {\n    const int size = 1024; // Example size, adjust as needed\n    const int bytes = size * sizeof(int);\n\n    int *h_idata = (int*)malloc(bytes);\n    int *h_odata = (int*)malloc(bytes);\n\n    // Initialize input data\n    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {\n        h_idata[i] = 1; // Example initialization, change as needed\n    }\n\n    int *d_idata, *d_odata;\n    cudaMalloc(&d_idata, bytes);\n    cudaMalloc(&d_odata, bytes);\n\n    cudaMemcpy(d_idata, h_idata, bytes, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);\n\n    int blockSize = 256; // Choose a block size\n    int gridSize = (size + blockSize - 1) / blockSize; // Calculate grid size\n\n    sumReduction<<<gridSize, blockSize, blockSize * sizeof(int)>>>(d_idata, d_odata, size);\n\n    // Copy result back to host\n    cudaMemcpy(h_odata, d_odata, gridSize * sizeof(int), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);\n\n    // Final reduction on CPU\n    int finalSum = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < gridSize; i++) {\n        finalSum += h_odata[i];\n    }\n\n    printf(\"Sum: %d\\n\", finalSum);\n\n    // Clean up\n    free(h_idata);\n    free(h_odata);\n    cudaFree(d_idata);\n    cudaFree(d_odata);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Shared Memory**: The kernel uses shared memory (`sdata`) to store partial sums for each block. This is faster than accessing global memory.\n  \n- **Reduction Loop**: The loop inside the kernel reduces the elements in shared memory. It divides the number of elements by 2 at each iteration (`s >>= 1`) and adds pairs of elements together.\n\n- **Block Result**: After the reduction, each block writes its result to the `g_odata` array.\n\n- **Final Reduction**: The final reduction is performed on the CPU after the kernel execution because the partial results from each block need to be combined.\n\nThis approach efficiently reduces an array to a single sum using parallel processing on the GPU. If your array is too large for a single kernel launch, you can recursively apply this reduction pattern."
