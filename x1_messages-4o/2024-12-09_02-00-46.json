        "content": "Yes, you can achieve consistent results across different files in your Python program by setting the random seed in a centralized location. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you do that:\n\n1. **Create a Configuration Module:**\n   Create a separate Python file, for example, `config.py`, where you can set the random seed. This will serve as a single point of configuration for your entire program.\n\n   ```python\n   # config.py\n   import random\n\n   def set_seed(seed_value):\n       random.seed(seed_value)\n   ```\n\n2. **Initialize the Seed in Your Main File:**\n   In your main script, import the `set_seed` function from the `config` module and call it with a specific seed value before executing any code that uses random functions.\n\n   ```python\n   # main.py\n   from config import set_seed\n\n   SEED_VALUE = 42  # or any other integer of your choice\n   set_seed(SEED_VALUE)\n\n   # Now you can import other modules and use random functions\n   # Example:\n   # import module1\n   # import module2\n   ```\n\n3. **Ensure Consistent Import Order:**\n   Make sure that the `set_seed` function is called before any other module that uses random functions is imported or executed.\n\n4. **Use the Seeded Random Functions:**\n   In your other modules, you can simply use the random functions as usual. Since the seed is set globally, it will ensure consistent behavior.\n\n   ```python\n   # module1.py\n   import random\n\n   def generate_random_number():\n       return random.randint(1, 100)\n\n   # module2.py\n   import random\n\n   def random_choice():\n       return random.choice(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'])\n   ```\n\nBy following this approach, you ensure that the random seed is set once, in a single location, and all random functions across different files will produce consistent results due to the global effect of the seed setting."
