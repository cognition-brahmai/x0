Here are the two expressions I am using:\n\nExpression 1:\n\n```python\ndf.filter(\"act_date <='2017-04-01'\" and \"act_date >='2016-10-01'\")\\\n  .select(\"col1\",\"col2\").distinct().count()\n```\nThis returns a result of 37M.\n\nExpression 2:\n\n```python\ndf.filter(\"act_date <='2017-04-01'\").filter(\"act_date >='2016-10-01'\")\\\n  .select(\"col1\",\"col2\").distinct().count()\n```\nThis returns a result of 25M.\n\nBoth expressions seem like they should produce the same result, but they are not. Why is this?"

        "content": "The discrepancy in results between the two expressions is due to the way logical expressions are evaluated in Python.\n\n### Expression 1:\n```python\ndf.filter(\"act_date <='2017-04-01'\" and \"act_date >='2016-10-01'\")\\\n  .select(\"col1\",\"col2\").distinct().count()\n```\nIn this expression, the logical `and` operator is being applied directly on the string literals `\"act_date <='2017-04-01'\"` and `\"act_date >='2016-10-01'\"`. In Python, the `and` operator returns the first operand if it is falsy, otherwise it returns the second operand. Since non-empty strings are truthy, this evaluates to `\"act_date >='2016-10-01'\"`. So effectively, this expression filters the DataFrame using only `\"act_date >='2016-10-01'\"`, which is why you see a larger result of 37M rows.\n\n### Expression 2:\n```python\ndf.filter(\"act_date <='2017-04-01'\").filter(\"act_date >='2016-10-01'\")\\\n  .select(\"col1\",\"col2\").distinct().count()\n```\nHere, each `filter` function is applied separately, and each condition is correctly applied to the DataFrame. The first `filter` reduces the DataFrame to rows where `\"act_date <='2017-04-01'\"`, and then the second `filter` further reduces it to rows where `\"act_date >='2016-10-01'\"`. This correctly results in the intended date range filter, leading to a count of 25M.\n\n### Correct Expression:\nTo achieve the intended filtering using a single `filter` call, you should use parentheses and proper logical operators within the string:\n\n```python\ndf.filter(\"(act_date <='2017-04-01') and (act_date >='2016-10-01')\")\\\n  .select(\"col1\",\"col2\").distinct().count()\n```\n\nThis will ensure that both conditions are applied simultaneously and correctly, mirroring the logic of Expression 2."
