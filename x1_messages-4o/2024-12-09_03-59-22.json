        "content": "To construct URLs in Python in the specified format, you can use the `urllib.parse` module which is part of the Python Standard Library. This module provides tools for parsing URLs and constructing query strings, making it well-suited for this task.\n\n### Why use `urllib.parse`?\n\n1. **Standard Library**: It's part of Python's standard library, so you don't need to install any external packages.\n2. **Comprehensive**: It provides functions to handle various aspects of URL parsing and construction, such as scheme, network location, path, and query parameters.\n3. **Ease of Use**: Functions like `urlencode` and `urlunparse` simplify the process of constructing URLs from components.\n\n### Sample Code\n\nHere's a sample code demonstrating how to construct a URL using `urllib.parse`:\n\n```python\nfrom urllib.parse import urlencode, urlunparse\n\n# Define the components of the URL\nscheme = 'http'\nnetloc = 'subdomain.domain.com'\npath = ''\nparams = ''\nquery = {'arg1': 'someargument', 'arg2': 'someotherargument'}\nfragment = ''\n\n# Encode the query parameters\nquery_string = urlencode(query)\n\n# Construct the full URL\nurl = urlunparse((scheme, netloc, path, params, query_string, fragment))\n\nprint(url)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **urlencode**: This function is used to convert a dictionary of query parameters into a URL-encoded query string.\n- **urlunparse**: This function takes a tuple containing the various components of a URL and constructs a complete URL from them.\n\nRunning the above code will output:\n\n```\nhttp://subdomain.domain.com?arg1=someargument&arg2=someotherargument\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that your URLs are constructed in a well-formed manner, handling special characters and encoding requirements appropriately."
