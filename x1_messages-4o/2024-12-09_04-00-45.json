        "content": "The lint error `'redefined-outer-name'` occurs when you redefine a variable in a local scope that has already been defined in an outer scope. This can lead to confusion and potential bugs in your code because it might not be clear which variable you are actually referring to at any given point.\n\nIn your case, it appears that the variable `tmp_file` is defined somewhere in an outer scope (perhaps globally or in a surrounding function), and then you are redefining it at line 38. To resolve this issue, you have a few options:\n\n1. **Rename the Local Variable**: Consider renaming the local `tmp_file` variable to something else that is more descriptive and doesn't conflict with the outer scope. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   local_tmp_file = open('../build/' + me_filename + '.js', 'w')\n   ```\n\n2. **Use Different Scopes**: If the outer `tmp_file` is still needed, make sure you are using it in the appropriate scope. If the outer variable is not needed, you can remove it to avoid conflicts.\n\n3. **Refactor Code Structure**: If `tmp_file` is being used across different scopes and needs to maintain a consistent state, consider refactoring your code to encapsulate the logic within a class or a separate function where the state of `tmp_file` can be managed more effectively.\n\n4. **Close the File Properly**: Ensure that you are properly closing the file after you are done using it to avoid resource leaks. It's a good practice to use a context manager (`with` statement) for file operations:\n\n   ```python\n   with open('../build/' + me_filename + '.js', 'w') as local_tmp_file:\n       # Perform file operations\n   ```\n\nBy following one of these approaches, you should be able to resolve the `'redefined-outer-name'` lint error and make your code cleaner and more maintainable."
