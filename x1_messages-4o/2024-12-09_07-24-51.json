I am trying to keep data about competitions in my database and want to be able to search the competitions by certain criteria - competition type in particular. The competition types are kept in a tuple and used in the model. However, when I define a form for the search functionality, the ChoiceField does not display an empty label, even though the fields are not required. \n\nHere is the tuple I am using:\n\n```python\nCOMPETITION_TYPE_CHOICES = (\n    (1, 'Olympic Games'),\n    (2, 'ISU Championships'),\n    (3, 'Grand Prix Series'),\n)\n```\n\nHere is how I am using it in the model:\n\n```python\nclass Competition(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=256)\n    type = models.IntegerField(choices=COMPETITION_TYPE_CHOICES) \n```\n\nAnd here is how I am defining the form:\n\n```python\nclass CompetitionSearchForm(forms.Form):\n    name = forms.CharField(required=False)\n    type = forms.ChoiceField(choices=COMPETITION_TYPE_CHOICES,required=False)\n```"

        "content": "To display an empty label in your `ChoiceField`, you need to add a blank choice to your `COMPETITION_TYPE_CHOICES` tuple. This blank choice will act as the default empty option when the form is rendered. You can achieve this by adding a tuple with an empty string as the first element. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n1. Update the `COMPETITION_TYPE_CHOICES` tuple to include a blank choice:\n\n```python\nCOMPETITION_TYPE_CHOICES = (\n    ('', '---------'),  # This is the blank choice\n    (1, 'Olympic Games'),\n    (2, 'ISU Championships'),\n    (3, 'Grand Prix Series'),\n)\n```\n\n2. Use the updated `COMPETITION_TYPE_CHOICES` in your form definition:\n\n```python\nclass CompetitionSearchForm(forms.Form):\n    name = forms.CharField(required=False)\n    type = forms.ChoiceField(choices=COMPETITION_TYPE_CHOICES, required=False)\n```\n\nWith this change, when you render the form, the dropdown will include a blank option labeled with '---------' (or any text you choose for the blank label), allowing users to select no specific competition type if they wish. This is a common way to allow for an optional selection in a `ChoiceField`."
