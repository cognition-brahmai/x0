        "content": "I am working on creating an iterative markov decision process (MDP) agent in Python. I need it to have the following characteristics: observable state, actions that may not always be available at all states, a reward function that may change over time, and policy convergence should be incremental and only computed per move. I also need to handle potential 'unknown' states by reserving some state space for answering query-type moves. Is there any existing python library that supports these requirements? Additionally, it should be cross-platform as I alternate between Windows and Linux environments. The information on per-move MDP learning seems to be quite limited, most focus on solving the entire policy as a preprocessing step. Can you suggest any library or a way to achieve this?"

        "content": "Creating an iterative Markov Decision Process (MDP) agent with the specified characteristics is indeed a complex task, but there are libraries and approaches that might help you achieve this. While most traditional MDP libraries focus on solving the entire policy as a preprocessing step, you can adapt some libraries to suit your needs for incremental policy convergence and handling dynamic reward functions.\n\n### Libraries and Tools\n\n1. **OpenAI Gym**: While primarily used for reinforcement learning, OpenAI Gym provides a flexible environment that you can adapt for MDPs. You can build custom environments that handle changing rewards and partial action availability. It is cross-platform and works on both Windows and Linux.\n\n2. **MDPtoolbox**: This library is part of the pymdptoolbox package and includes tools for solving MDPs using various algorithms. Although it doesn\u2019t inherently handle per-move learning, you can modify the update rules to only update policies incrementally.\n\n3. **RLlib (part of Ray)**: RLlib offers scalable reinforcement learning algorithms and can handle dynamic environments and policies. It can be adapted to your MDP requirements, especially since it supports dynamic observation and reward functions.\n\n4. **PyTorch or TensorFlow**: If you are open to implementing more custom solutions, using machine learning libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow can give you the flexibility to design your reward functions and update policies incrementally.\n\n### Implementation Strategy\n\n1. **Custom Environment**: Implement a custom environment that manages observable states and dynamically available actions. Handle unknown states by reserving a portion of your state space for them.\n\n2. **Incremental Policy Updates**: Modify existing algorithms or implement a custom approach where the policy is updated after each move rather than solving for the entire policy beforehand. This can be achieved by focusing on local updates to the policy based on the latest state and reward feedback.\n\n3. **Dynamic Reward Function**: Design your reward function to be a callable entity that can change over time based on certain conditions or external inputs. This will help in adapting to changing environments.\n\n4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensure that your development environment uses cross-platform compatible libraries (most Python libraries are, but it's always good to test) and use containerization (like Docker) if necessary to ensure consistency across different operating systems.\n\n5. **Handling Unknown States**: Implement a mechanism to handle unknown states, perhaps by reserving a specific portion of your state space for exploration or implementing a fallback policy that handles queries or unknown scenarios.\n\nBy leveraging these libraries and strategies, you should be able to develop a flexible and adaptive MDP agent that meets your requirements."
