The module is imported as a Class and not a Module due to the __init__.py of the parent package. When I try to run 'from MyPak import MyMod' in Python shell or ipython shell, it doesn't update the Class definition. I am looking for a way to update the class in the Python shell without restarting the Python interpreter. I am currently working on BioPython, specifically Bio.PDB.PDBParser. My issue arises when I make changes to PDBParser.py and try to reload it in ipython, the changes do not reflect. Here is what I am doing:\n\n```python\n# start ipython v0.10\nimport Bio\nfrom Bio.PDB import PDBParser\np = PDBParser()\ns = p.get_structure()\n# then I make changes, e.g. simply print some text, in PDBParser.py\ndel Bio\ndel PDBParser\ndel s\nimport Bio  # or reload(Bio) without deleting all the objects\nfrom Bio.PDB import PDBParser\np = PDBParser()\ns = p.get_structure() # expected output after change not seen :(\n```\nHowever, I could not see the printed text. It seems that the changes were not applied. How can I solve this?"

        "content": "When you're working in an interactive Python shell like IPython and you want to reload a module to reflect changes in its source code, using `import` or `del` alone won't update the module. This is because Python caches imported modules, and simply re-importing them will not re-run the module code.\n\nHere's how you can reload a module in Python, especially when you are using IPython:\n\n1. **Use `importlib.reload`:**\n\n   Python 3 provides the `importlib` module, which has a `reload` function that can be used to reload a module. Here's how you can do it:\n\n   ```python\n   import importlib\n   import Bio.PDB.PDBParser\n   \n   # Make changes to PDBParser.py here\n\n   importlib.reload(Bio.PDB.PDBParser)\n   ```\n\n2. **Use IPython's magic command `%autoreload`:**\n\n   If you're using IPython, you can use the `%autoreload` magic function, which automatically reloads modules before executing new code. To set this up, do the following in your IPython session:\n\n   ```python\n   %load_ext autoreload\n   %autoreload 2\n   ```\n\n   This will automatically reload all modules (except those excluded) every time before executing a new line of code.\n\n3. **Reloading Classes:**\n\n   If you've imported a class from a module directly and want to reload it, you need to import the module, reload the module, and then re-import the class:\n\n   ```python\n   import importlib\n   import Bio.PDB.PDBParser  # Import the module\n\n   # Make changes to PDBParser.py here\n\n   importlib.reload(Bio.PDB.PDBParser)  # Reload the module\n   from Bio.PDB import PDBParser  # Re-import the class\n   ```\n\n   Note that when you directly import a class or function from a module, simply reloading the module won't update the class or function in the current namespace. You need to re-import it.\n\n4. **Considerations:**\n\n   - If you have any instances of the class that were created before reloading, they will still be instances of the old class definition. You need to recreate them after reloading the module.\n   - If your changes involve changes to other imported modules, ensure those are reloaded as well.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to see your changes reflected in the Python shell without restarting the interpreter."
