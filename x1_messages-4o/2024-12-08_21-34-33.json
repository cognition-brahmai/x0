        "content": "Certainly! To classify the items as fruits or vegetables, we can consider both botanical definitions and common culinary uses:\n\n1. **Apple**: \n   - **Botanical**: Fruit\n   - **Culinary**: Fruit\n\n2. **Cucumber**: \n   - **Botanical**: Fruit (it develops from the flower of the cucumber plant and contains seeds)\n   - **Culinary**: Vegetable (commonly used in salads and savory dishes)\n\n3. **Banana**: \n   - **Botanical**: Fruit\n   - **Culinary**: Fruit\n\nSo, based on botanical classification, all three items are fruits. However, in culinary terms, cucumbers are often treated as vegetables."
