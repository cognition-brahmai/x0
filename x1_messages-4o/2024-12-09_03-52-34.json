Here's the code I have so far:\n\n```python\nclass ParentClass(object):\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.x = [1,2,3]\n\n    def test(self):\n        print 'Im in parent class'\n\n\nclass ChildClass(ParentClass):\n\n    def test(self):\n        super(ChildClass,self).test()\n        print \"Value of x = \". self.x\n\n\nx = ChildClass()\nx.test()\n```\n\nHowever, I am unsure of how to access the value of self.x in the child class. Can you provide me with a solution?"

        "content": "Certainly! In your code, you're very close to accessing the `self.x` attribute in the `ChildClass`. However, there is a small syntax error in the `print` statement within the `ChildClass`. You're using a period (`.`) instead of a comma (`,`) to concatenate the string with the variable. Here's the corrected code:\n\n```python\nclass ParentClass(object):\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.x = [1, 2, 3]\n\n    def test(self):\n        print('Im in parent class')\n\n\nclass ChildClass(ParentClass):\n\n    def test(self):\n        super(ChildClass, self).test()\n        print(\"Value of x =\", self.x)\n\n\nx = ChildClass()\nx.test()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- Use a comma `,` in the `print` statement to concatenate strings with variables.\n- Parent class attributes are inherited by the child class, so `self.x` is directly accessible within `ChildClass`.\n- The `super()` function is used to call the method from the parent class.\n\nNow, when you run this code, you should get the following output:\n```\nIm in parent class\nValue of x = [1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nThis output confirms that the `ChildClass` is successfully accessing the `self.x` variable from the `ParentClass`."
