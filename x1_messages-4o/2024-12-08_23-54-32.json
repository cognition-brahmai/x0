However, your original sentence is in future tense (\"will be hit\"), so you need to maintain the future tense in your conversion.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Identify the Subject in Active Voice**: Batsman\n2. **Identify the Verb in Future Tense**: will hit\n3. **Identify the Object**: the ball\n\nThus, the active voice sentence will be:\n\n\"The batsman will hit the ball.\""
