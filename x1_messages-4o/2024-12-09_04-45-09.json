        "content": "Automatically adjusting the font size in a seaborn heatmap so that it fits perfectly within each square is not directly available as a built-in feature. However, you can achieve a dynamic adjustment by calculating an appropriate font size based on the dimensions of your heatmap. Here's an approach you can take:\n\n1. Determine the dimensions of the heatmap.\n2. Calculate an appropriate font size based on these dimensions.\n\nHere's a sample code snippet that demonstrates how you might achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Sample data\ndata = np.random.rand(10, 10)\ncorrmat = np.corrcoef(data)\n\n# Create a heatmap\nax = sns.heatmap(corrmat, vmin=corrmat.min(), vmax=1, square=True, cmap=\"YlGnBu\", linewidths=0.1, annot=True)\n\n# Get the size of the figure to calculate appropriate font size\nfig = plt.gcf()\nfig_width, fig_height = fig.get_size_inches()\n\n# Calculate the number of squares in both dimensions\nnum_x, num_y = corrmat.shape\n\n# Calculate the average size of each square\nsquare_width = fig_width / num_x\nsquare_height = fig_height / num_y\n\n# Choose the smaller dimension to ensure text fits both horizontally and vertically\nfont_size = min(square_width, square_height) * 20  # Adjust multiplier as needed\n\n# Update the heatmap with the calculated font size\nsns.heatmap(corrmat, vmin=corrmat.min(), vmax=1, square=True, cmap=\"YlGnBu\", linewidths=0.1, \n            annot=True, annot_kws={\"size\": font_size})\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- The `fig.get_size_inches()` function is used to get the size of the figure in inches.\n- The number of squares in each dimension (`num_x` and `num_y`) is calculated.\n- The average size of each square is computed.\n- The font size is set to a scaled value of the smaller dimension of the squares (`square_width` or `square_height`), ensuring it fits within both width and height.\n\nYou may need to adjust the multiplier (in this case `20`) to better fit your specific visualization needs. This approach gives you a dynamic font size that adapts to the size of the heatmap."
