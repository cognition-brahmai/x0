I have tried using the -s, -silent, -S, and -quiet options but none seem to work. Here is a typical command I have tried: \n\n```bash\ncurl -s http://google.com > temp.html\n```\n\nHowever, I only get the progress bar when redirecting the output to a file. For instance, the command `curl -s http://google.com` doesn't display a progress bar but `curl -s http://google.com > temp.html` does. How can I solve this?"

        "content": "To prevent cURL from displaying the progress bar when redirecting output to a file, you can use the `-o` or `--output` option instead of redirecting with `>`. The `-o` option explicitly tells cURL where to save the output, which prevents it from showing the progress bar. You can also ensure that the `-s` or `--silent` flag is used, which suppresses both the progress meter and error messages.\n\nHere's how you can modify your command:\n\n```bash\ncurl -s -o temp.html http://google.com\n```\n\nBy using `-o temp.html`, you specify that the output should be written to the file `temp.html`, and the `-s` option ensures that the progress bar and other messages are suppressed. This should solve the issue of the progress bar appearing."
