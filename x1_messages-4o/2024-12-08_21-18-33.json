        "content": "The efficiency of an algorithm in terms of time complexity is typically measured by how the runtime of the algorithm scales with the size of the input data. This is often expressed using Big O notation, which provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithm's runtime as the input size increases.\n\nIn your example, you provided a Java code snippet that calculates the sum by iterating over two nested loops. Let's analyze it step by step to determine its Big O notation.\n\n### Java Code Example:\n\n```java\nint sum = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n   for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\n      sum++;\n   }\n}\nSystem.out.println(sum);\n```\n\n### Time Complexity Analysis:\n\n1. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop runs `n` times, where `n` is the size of the input.\n\n2. **Inner Loop**: For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop also runs `n` times.\n\n3. **Operations within the loops**: The operation inside the inner loop (`sum++`) is a constant time operation, taking O(1) time.\n\n### Calculate Big O Notation:\n\n- Since the inner loop runs `n` times for each of the `n` iterations of the outer loop, the total number of iterations is `n * n = n^2`.\n- Therefore, the time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2).\n\n### Formula Calculation:\n\n- The Big O notation you've calculated is correct. The time complexity T(n) is expressed as:\n\n  \\[\n  T(n) = O(n^2)\n  \\]\n\nThis indicates that the runtime of the algorithm grows quadratically as the input size `n` increases. In practical terms, this means that if you double the size of the input, the runtime will increase by about four times.\n\nIn summary, the given Java code snippet has a time complexity of O(n^2), which reflects the nested nature of the loops causing a quadratic growth in the number of operations."
