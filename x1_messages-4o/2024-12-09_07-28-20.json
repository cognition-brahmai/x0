Currently, I am manually extracting the process id (pid) and killing it as shown below:\n\n```bash\n[~]$ ps aux | grep 'python csp_build.py'\nuser    5124  1.0  0.3 214588 13852 pts/4    Sl+  11:19   0:00 python csp_build.py\nuser    5373  0.0  0.0   8096   960 pts/6    S+   11:20   0:00 grep python csp_build.py\n[~]$ kill 5124\n```\n\nI am looking for a way to automate the extraction of the process id and to kill it using a single command line. Ideally, it would look something like this:\n\n```bash\n[~]$ ps aux | grep 'python csp_build.py' | kill <regex that returns the pid>\n```\n\nIs there a way to accomplish this?"

        "content": "Yes, you can automate the process of extracting the process ID and killing it using a combination of command-line tools such as `awk`, `grep`, and `xargs`. Here's how you can do it in a single command:\n\n```bash\n[~]$ ps aux | grep '[p]ython csp_build.py' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill\n```\n\nExplanation of the command:\n\n1. **`ps aux`**: Lists all the running processes with detailed information.\n2. **`grep '[p]ython csp_build.py'`**: Filters the list to only include the process you're interested in. The square brackets `[p]` is a trick to prevent `grep` from matching its own process.\n3. **`awk '{print $2}'`**: Extracts the second column from the filtered output, which corresponds to the process ID (PID).\n4. **`xargs kill`**: Passes the extracted PID(s) to the `kill` command to terminate the process(es).\n\nThis command will find and kill any running instance of `python csp_build.py`. Make sure to use this with caution, as it will kill all matching processes."
