When I try to import cx_Oracle in Python, it fails because the built cx_Oracle.so cannot find libclntsh.so.11.1. The libclntsh.so.11.1 is in my Oracle client installation directory and the cx_Oracle setup.py seems to be picking up this lib directory. However, when I run $ ldd cx_Oracle.so, it still shows libclntsh.so.11.1 => not found. My LD_LIBRARY_PATH contains the lib directory with libclntsh.so.11.1 but it doesn't seem to make a difference. When I try to load the built module in Python, it gives me an ImportError: libclntsh.so.11.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory. Is there something obviously wrong with this setup?"

        "content": "It sounds like you're encountering a common issue with dynamic library loading in Linux. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially resolve this problem:\n\n1. **Verify LD_LIBRARY_PATH:**\n   Ensure that your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is correctly set and exported for the session or environment where you're running Python. You can set it in your shell like this:\n\n   ```bash\n   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/oracle/client/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n   ```\n\n   Replace `/path/to/oracle/client/lib` with the actual path to the Oracle client library directory that contains `libclntsh.so.11.1`.\n\n2. **Check the Permissions:**\n   Make sure that the `libclntsh.so.11.1` file has the correct permissions to be read by your user. You can check and set the permissions using:\n\n   ```bash\n   chmod 755 /path/to/oracle/client/lib/libclntsh.so.11.1\n   ```\n\n3. **Use `ldconfig`:**\n   You can add your Oracle client library directory to the system's library path using `ldconfig`. Create a new file in `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/`, for example, `oracle.conf`, and add the path to it:\n\n   ```bash\n   echo \"/path/to/oracle/client/lib\" | sudo tee /etc/ld.so.conf.d/oracle.conf\n   ```\n\n   Then, run `ldconfig` to update the library cache:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo ldconfig\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify with `ldd`:**\n   After setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or using `ldconfig`, run `ldd` again to check if the dependencies are correctly resolved:\n\n   ```bash\n   ldd /path/to/cx_Oracle.so\n   ```\n\n   Ensure that it shows a valid path for `libclntsh.so.11.1`.\n\n5. **Check Environment in Python:**\n   Sometimes, the environment variables are not carried over into the Python environment. You can check the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` within Python by doing:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   print(os.environ.get('LD_LIBRARY_PATH'))\n   ```\n\n   If it\u2019s not set, you might need to set it within your Python script before importing `cx_Oracle`.\n\n6. **Symlink the Library:**\n   If the library is still not found, you can create a symbolic link to `libclntsh.so.11.1` in a directory that is already in your library path:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo ln -s /path/to/oracle/client/lib/libclntsh.so.11.1 /usr/lib/libclntsh.so.11.1\n   ```\n\n7. **Check for 32/64-bit Compatibility:**\n   Ensure that your Python, Oracle client, and `cx_Oracle` are all either 32-bit or 64-bit. Mismatched architectures can cause these types of errors.\n\nIf you've tried all these steps and are still having issues, double-check the paths and environment settings, and consider reinstalling the Oracle client or cx_Oracle to ensure there are no corrupted files."
