        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum amount of chicken and beef you can buy while satisfying the given constraints:\n\n1. Total meat weight (chicken + beef + tofu) = 10 pounds\n2. Total cost should not exceed $45\n3. Equal amount of chicken and beef\n4. At least 2 pounds of tofu\n\nLet's start by defining variables:\n- Let \\( x \\) be the pounds of chicken.\n- Let \\( x \\) also be the pounds of beef (since they need to be equal).\n- Let \\( y \\) be the pounds of tofu.\n\nFrom the third constraint, we know:\n\\[ y \\geq 2 \\]\n\nFrom the first constraint, the total weight is 10 pounds:\n\\[ x + x + y = 10 \\]\n\\[ 2x + y = 10 \\]\n\nFrom the second constraint, the total cost should not exceed $45:\n\\[ 5.49x + 6.99x + 3.99y \\leq 45 \\]\n\\[ 12.48x + 3.99y \\leq 45 \\]\n\nNow, let's substitute \\( y = 10 - 2x \\) from the weight equation into the cost equation:\n\\[ 12.48x + 3.99(10 - 2x) \\leq 45 \\]\n\\[ 12.48x + 39.9 - 7.98x \\leq 45 \\]\n\\[ 4.5x + 39.9 \\leq 45 \\]\n\\[ 4.5x \\leq 5.1 \\]\n\\[ x \\leq \\frac{5.1}{4.5} \\]\n\\[ x \\leq 1.1333 \\]\n\nSince \\( x \\) must be a whole number (as you can't buy a fraction of a pound in this context), the maximum integer value for \\( x \\) is 1.\n\nThus, you can buy:\n- 1 pound of chicken\n- 1 pound of beef\n- Therefore, \\( y = 10 - 2 \\times 1 = 8 \\) pounds of tofu\n\nThis meets all the constraints:\n- Total pounds: \\( 1 + 1 + 8 = 10 \\) pounds\n- Total cost: \\( 5.49 \\times 1 + 6.99 \\times 1 + 3.99 \\times 8 = 5.49 + 6.99 + 31.92 = 44.40 \\) dollars, which is under $45.\n\nSo, the maximum amount of chicken and beef you can buy is 1 pound each, while still meeting the given restrictions."
