        "content": "I am new to NetworkX and I have created a graph using the `nx.read_edgelist` function where the edges are positive, but do not sum up to one. Is there a built-in method that makes a random walk of `k` steps from a certain node and returns the node list? If not, what is the easiest way of doing it, considering that nodes can repeat? The pseudo-code for my problem is as follows:\n\n```python\nnode = random\nres = [node]\nfor i in range(0, k):\n    read edge weights from this node\n    an edge from this node has probability weight / sum_weights\n    node = pick an edge from this node \n    res.append(node)\n```"

        "content": "NetworkX does not provide a built-in function specifically for performing random walks with edge weights that do not necessarily sum to one. However, you can implement a custom random walk function using the weights as probabilities. Here's a Python function that does this using the `random.choices` method from the `random` module, which allows you to specify weights for the choices:\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nimport random\n\ndef random_walk(graph, start_node, k):\n    current_node = start_node\n    walk = [current_node]\n\n    for _ in range(k):\n        neighbors = list(graph.neighbors(current_node))\n        if not neighbors:\n            break\n        weights = [graph[current_node][neighbor].get('weight', 1) for neighbor in neighbors]\n        total_weight = sum(weights)\n        \n        # Normalize weights to sum to 1 for random.choices\n        probabilities = [weight / total_weight for weight in weights]\n        \n        # Select the next node based on the weights\n        current_node = random.choices(neighbors, probabilities)[0]\n        walk.append(current_node)\n\n    return walk\n\n# Example usage:\n# G = nx.read_edgelist('path_to_edgelist', data=(('weight', float),))\n# start_node = 'A'  # Replace with your start node\n# k = 10  # Number of steps\n# result = random_walk(G, start_node, k)\n# print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: Start from the given `start_node` and initialize the walk list with this node.\n2. **Iterate `k` steps**: For each step in the random walk:\n   - Get the neighbors of the current node.\n   - If there are no neighbors (which can happen in a disconnected graph), break out of the loop.\n   - Retrieve the weights of the edges connecting the current node to its neighbors.\n   - Normalize these weights to sum to 1 to use them as probabilities.\n   - Use `random.choices` to select the next node based on these probabilities.\n   - Append the chosen node to the walk list.\n3. **Return the walk**: After completing `k` steps, return the list of nodes visited during the random walk.\n\nThis method ensures that transitions between nodes are made with probabilities proportional to the edge weights, effectively simulating a weighted random walk."
