I am currently using `import os` and a command line speech program to say \"Process complete\". I would prefer it to be a simple \"bell\". I have tried using `print(\\a)`, but that didn't work. I am working on a Mac. I know there's a function `NSBeep` that can be used in Cocoa apps, but I don't think it's relevant in this case."

        "content": "To make a Python program alert you with a beep sound on a Mac, you can use several approaches. Here are a few options that should work:\n\n### Option 1: Use the `beep` Command\n\nmacOS has a built-in command `beep` that you can trigger from within Python. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Your task code here\n\n# Trigger a beep sound\nos.system('echo -n \"\\a\"')\n```\n\n### Option 2: Use the `subprocess` Module\n\nYou can also use the `subprocess` module to execute the `afplay` command to play a system sound:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\n# Your task code here\n\n# Play the system sound (you can use any sound file you prefer)\nsubprocess.run(['afplay', '/System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff'])\n```\n\n### Option 3: Use `print('\\a')` with System Beep\n\nIf `print('\\a')` doesn't work directly in your terminal, ensure your terminal's bell is enabled in the settings. This method relies on terminal settings, so it might not work in all environments.\n\n### Option 4: Use the `sound` Python Package\n\nFor more control over sound, you can install and use the `sound` package to play a beep:\n\n1. Install the package using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install sound\n   ```\n\n2. Use it in your script:\n\n```python\nfrom sound import Sound\n\n# Your task code here\n\n# Play a beep sound\nSound().play('bell')\n```\n\nEach of these options should help you alert yourself when your Python script completes its task. Choose the one that best fits your needs and environment."
