This data can influence itinerary suggestions, such as recommending indoor activities during bad weather.\n   - Integrate event APIs or local event platforms (such as Eventbrite, Meetup, or local tourism boards) to get updates on local events. This can help suggest events that match the user's interests.\n\n2. **Contextual Recommendations**:\n   - Modify the chatbot algorithms to consider weather and events when suggesting activities. For example, suggest beach activities on sunny days or local festivals happening during the user's visit.\n   - Provide users with options to adjust their plans based on weather forecasts or newly available events.\n\n3. **User Preferences and Notifications**:\n   - Allow users to set preferences for weather conditions or types of events they are interested in.\n   - Implement notification systems to alert users about sudden weather changes or last-minute events.\n\n### Enhancing Visualization Tool with Virtual Reality:\n\n1. **VR Content Creation**:\n   - Develop or source high-quality 360-degree videos and VR content for popular attractions at the destination. This could involve partnering with local tourism boards or using platforms like Google Street View.\n   - Create interactive VR experiences that allow users to \"walk through\" destinations or explore key attractions virtually.\n\n2. **Technology Integration**:\n   - Integrate VR experiences into the existing itinerary planning tool. This could be via VR-compatible web platforms or apps that support VR headsets like Oculus or Google Cardboard.\n   - Ensure compatibility with various devices to make VR accessible to a wider audience.\n\n3. **User Interface and Experience**:\n   - Design an intuitive user interface that allows users to seamlessly switch between itinerary planning and VR experiences.\n   - Include features like VR tour guides or interactive maps to enhance the immersive experience.\n\n4. **Feedback and Iteration**:\n   - Collect user feedback on the VR experiences to continuously improve content and usability.\n   - Regularly update VR content to include new attractions and experiences, ensuring the tool remains current and engaging.\n\nBy integrating these features, the chatbot and visualization tool can provide a more dynamic and engaging travel planning experience, helping users make informed decisions and get excited about their upcoming trips."
