        "content": "The `sorted()` function in Python uses an adaptive, stable, and in-place mergesort algorithm, which is referred to as Timsort. The runtime complexity of Timsort is \\(O(n \\log n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of elements in the list. This complexity holds for the average and worst-case scenarios. \n\nWhen you're using `sorted()` with the `key` parameter, such as in your code with `key=itemgetter(0)`, the sorting still operates with a complexity of \\(O(n \\log n)\\). However, it's important to note that the key function is applied to each element, which means there is an additional overhead of \\(O(n)\\) for creating a list of keys before sorting. Therefore, the overall complexity remains \\(O(n \\log n)\\)."
