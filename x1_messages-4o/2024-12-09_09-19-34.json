        "content": "To solve the Knapsack problem using dynamic programming in Python, you can follow these steps. The Knapsack problem involves selecting a subset of items, each with a weight and a value, to include in a knapsack so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.\n\nHere's a Python implementation using dynamic programming for a knapsack of size 5:\n\n```python\ndef knapsack(values, weights, capacity):\n    n = len(values)\n    \n    # Create a 2D array to store the maximum value that can be obtained\n    # for each subproblem. The array has (n+1) rows and (capacity+1) columns.\n    dp = [[0 for _ in range(capacity + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    \n    # Build the table in a bottom-up manner\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        for w in range(1, capacity + 1):\n            if weights[i-1] <= w:\n                # If the current item's weight is less than or equal to the current capacity,\n                # consider the maximum value obtained by including or excluding the item\n                dp[i][w] = max(dp[i-1][w], dp[i-1][w-weights[i-1]] + values[i-1])\n            else:\n                # If the current item's weight is greater than the current capacity,\n                # exclude the item\n                dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w]\n    \n    # The bottom-right corner of the table contains the maximum value\n    return dp[n][capacity]\n\n# Example usage:\nvalues = [60, 100, 120, 90, 75]    # The values of the items\nweights = [10, 20, 30, 25, 15]     # The weights of the items\ncapacity = 50                      # The maximum weight capacity of the knapsack\n\nmax_value = knapsack(values, weights, capacity)\nprint(\"The maximum value that can be obtained is:\", max_value)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - We initialize a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][w]` represents the maximum value that can be obtained with the first `i` items and a knapsack capacity of `w`.\n\n2. **Filling the DP Table:**\n   - For each item, we decide whether to include it in the knapsack or not.\n   - If the item's weight is less than or equal to the current capacity `w`, we have two choices: include the item or exclude it. We choose the option that gives the maximum value.\n   - If the item's weight is greater than `w`, we cannot include the item, so we just take the value from the previous item at the same capacity.\n\n3. **Result:**\n   - The maximum value for the entire problem is found at `dp[n][capacity]`, where `n` is the number of items.\n\nThis approach solves the problem in O(n * capacity) time complexity, which is efficient for moderate sizes of `n` and `capacity`."
