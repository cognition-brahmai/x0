Here is my current code:\n\n```python\nimport fileinput\nf = open('hexa', 'w')\nfor line in fileinput.input(['pattern0.txt']):\n   f.write(hex(int(line)))\n   f.write('\\n')\n```"

        "content": "To use the `hex()` function in Python without the leading '0x', you can simply slice the string to remove the first two characters. You can achieve this by using the string slicing technique. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve that:\n\n```python\nimport fileinput\n\n# Open the file 'hexa' in write mode\nwith open('hexa', 'w') as f:\n    # Iterate over each line in the input file 'pattern0.txt'\n    for line in fileinput.input(['pattern0.txt']):\n        # Convert the line to an integer and then to a hexadecimal string\n        # Slice the string to remove the leading '0x'\n        hex_value = hex(int(line)).lstrip('0x')\n        \n        # Write the modified hexadecimal string to the file\n        f.write(hex_value)\n        f.write('\\n')\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **String Slicing:** \n   - `lstrip('0x')` is used to remove any leading '0x' from the string returned by `hex()`.\n\n2. **Context Manager (`with` statement):**\n   - Utilized `with open(...)` to handle file operations, which is a better practice as it ensures the file is properly closed after its block is executed.\n\nWith these changes, the hexadecimal numbers will be written to the file without the '0x' prefix."
