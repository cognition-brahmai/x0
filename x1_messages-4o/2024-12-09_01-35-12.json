I've noticed that there are two different functions available to perform this task: Image.resize and Image.thumbnail, as mentioned in the documentation (http://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.resize, http://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.thumbnail). Can someone explain the difference between these two functions and guide me on which one I should use?"

        "content": "Certainly! Both `Image.resize()` and `Image.thumbnail()` are used to change the size of an image in the Pillow library, but they serve slightly different purposes and work in distinct ways.\n\n### Image.resize()\n\n- **Functionality**: This function returns a new image that is resized to the specified dimensions. It does not maintain the aspect ratio unless you calculate it manually.\n- **Usage**: You specify the exact size you want the new image to be.\n- **Aspect Ratio**: It does not automatically maintain the aspect ratio. If you want to preserve the aspect ratio, you'll need to calculate the dimensions yourself.\n- **Return Value**: It returns a new image object.\n- **Example**:\n  ```python\n  from PIL import Image\n\n  img = Image.open('example.jpg')\n  resized_img = img.resize((width, height))\n  resized_img.save('resized_image.jpg')\n  ```\n\n### Image.thumbnail()\n\n- **Functionality**: This function modifies the image in place to fit within the specified size, maintaining the aspect ratio.\n- **Usage**: You specify the maximum size, and it scales the image to fit within these dimensions while maintaining the aspect ratio.\n- **Aspect Ratio**: It automatically preserves the aspect ratio.\n- **Return Value**: It modifies the original image in place and does not return a new image object.\n- **Example**:\n  ```python\n  from PIL import Image\n\n  img = Image.open('example.jpg')\n  img.thumbnail((max_width, max_height))\n  img.save('thumbnail_image.jpg')\n  ```\n\n### Which One to Use?\n\n- Use `Image.resize()` if you need to resize the image to exact dimensions and you are handling the aspect ratio yourself.\n- Use `Image.thumbnail()` if you want to ensure the image fits within a specified size while maintaining the aspect ratio. This is particularly useful for creating thumbnails where you don't want to distort the image.\n\nChoosing between them depends on whether maintaining the aspect ratio is important and whether you need the image to be an exact size."
