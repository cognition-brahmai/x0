        "content": "Certainly! The modulo operation in Python can be a bit counterintuitive when dealing with negative numbers, but it's based on a specific mathematical principle.\n\nIn Python, the result of the modulo operation `a % b` is always in the range from `0` to `b - 1`, where `b` is the divisor. This is because Python follows the rule that the result of `a % b` should have the same sign as the divisor `b`.\n\nWhen you perform `-5 % 4`, you are essentially finding a number `r` such that:\n\n1. `-5 = 4 * q + r` for some integer `q`\n2. `0 <= r < 4`\n\nTo find `q` and `r`, consider:\n\n- `-5` divided by `4` gives `-1.25`, which rounds towards negative infinity to `-2` in Python's integer division (`//`).\n- Substitute `q = -2` back into the equation: `-5 = 4 * (-2) + r`, which simplifies to `-5 = -8 + r`.\n- Solve for `r`: `r = -5 + 8 = 3`.\n\nThus, `-5 % 4` results in `3`, satisfying the condition `0 <= r < 4`.\n\nThis behavior ensures consistency in the sign of the result relative to the divisor, which is why you see `3` as the result of `-5 % 4`."
