According to the Jinja template documentation, I should use the `upper(s)` function to convert a value to uppercase. However, when I use this function in my code:\n\n```python\n{% if student.department == \"Academy\" %}\n    Academy\n{% elif  upper(student.department) != \"MATHS DEPARTMENT\" %}\n    Maths department\n{% endif %}\n```\n\nI encounter the error `UndefinedError: 'upper' is undefined`. How should I properly convert a string to uppercase in Jinja2?"

        "content": "In Jinja2, you can convert a string to uppercase by using the `upper` filter rather than a function. The `upper` function you tried to use is not available in Jinja2, which is why you're encountering the `UndefinedError`. Instead, you should use the `upper` filter, which is applied using the pipe (`|`) symbol.\n\nHere's how you can modify your template to convert the `student.department` to uppercase using the `upper` filter:\n\n```jinja\n{% if student.department == \"Academy\" %}\n    Academy\n{% elif student.department|upper != \"MATHS DEPARTMENT\" %}\n    Maths department\n{% endif %}\n```\n\nThis way, the `upper` filter will convert the value of `student.department` to uppercase, allowing you to perform the comparison correctly."
