The code is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Create the axis and plot.\nplt.axis([0, 10, 0, 10])\naxis_x = range(1, 11)\ngrd = [1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1, 6.1, 7.1, 8.1, 9.1, 10.1]\ngrd2 = [1.2, 2.2, 3.2, 4.2, 5.2, 6.2, 7.2, 8.2, 9.2, 10.2]\nplt.plot(axis_x, grd, '-g', label='BR1')\nplt.plot(axis_x, grd2, '-b', label='BR2')\nplt.legend(loc='upper left')\nplt.grid()\nplt.show()\n\n# Save the results vector to a text file.\nnp.savetxt('test.out', (grd, grd2))\n\n# Save the figure as '.eps' file.\nplt.savefig('expl.pdf', format='pdf', dpi=1200)\n```\n\nBut when I open the output files `expl.pdf` and/or `test.out`, I find them blank and nothing is displayed in there. Can you help me understand why this is happening?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The issue you're experiencing with the `plt.savefig` function is likely due to the sequence of commands in your code. The `plt.show()` function is used to display the plot in a window and, when called, it often clears the figure after displaying it. This means that any subsequent attempts to save the plot using `plt.savefig()` will save an empty figure, resulting in a blank file.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you should call `plt.savefig()` before `plt.show()`. Here's your modified code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Create the axis and plot.\nplt.axis([0, 10, 0, 10])\naxis_x = range(1, 11)\ngrd = [1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1, 6.1, 7.1, 8.1, 9.1, 10.1]\ngrd2 = [1.2, 2.2, 3.2, 4.2, 5.2, 6.2, 7.2, 8.2, 9.2, 10.2]\nplt.plot(axis_x, grd, '-g', label='BR1')\nplt.plot(axis_x, grd2, '-b', label='BR2')\nplt.legend(loc='upper left')\nplt.grid()\n\n# Save the figure as '.pdf' file.\nplt.savefig('expl.pdf', format='pdf', dpi=1200)\n\n# Show the plot.\nplt.show()\n\n# Save the results vector to a text file.\nnp.savetxt('test.out', (grd, grd2))\n```\n\nBy saving the figure before calling `plt.show()`, you ensure that the plot is saved correctly to the file. This should fix the issue, and you should be able to see the plot in `expl.pdf`. The `test.out` file should contain the data as expected since `np.savetxt()` is not affected by `plt.show()`."
