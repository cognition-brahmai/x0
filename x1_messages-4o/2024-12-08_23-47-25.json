Use the following ingredients:\n- Sliced bread\n- Mayonnaise\n- Lettuce\n- Tomato\n- Cheese\n- Meat\nRemember, the meat should be placed between the sliced bread, and the lettuce and tomato should go on top of the meat. The mayonnaise and cheese can go anywhere you like! Good luck with your sandwich making!"

Below is a MATLAB code that accomplishes the task of shuffling and displaying the ingredients of a sandwich with the specified constraints:\n\n```matlab\nfunction randomSandwich()\n    % Define the fixed and flexible ingredients\n    fixedIngredients = {'Sliced bread', 'Lettuce', 'Tomato', 'Meat'};\n    flexibleIngredients = {'Mayonnaise', 'Cheese'};\n    \n    % Shuffle the flexible ingredients\n    shuffledFlexible = flexibleIngredients(randperm(length(flexibleIngredients)));\n    \n    % Assemble the sandwich with the constraints\n    % Meat should be between the sliced bread\n    % Lettuce and Tomato should go on top of the meat\n    sandwich = {\n        fixedIngredients{1}, ...  % Bottom bread\n        shuffledFlexible{1}, ...  % Random flexible ingredient\n        fixedIngredients{4}, ...  % Meat\n        fixedIngredients{2}, ...  % Lettuce\n        fixedIngredients{3}, ...  % Tomato\n        shuffledFlexible{2}, ...  % Random flexible ingredient\n        fixedIngredients{1} ...   % Top bread\n    };\n    \n    % Display the sandwich\n    disp('Your random sandwich order is:')\n    for i = 1:length(sandwich)\n        disp(sandwich{i})\n    end\nend\n```\n\nTo use this code, simply call the `randomSandwich` function in MATLAB. Each time you run it, the mayonnaise and cheese will be placed in a random order within the constraints provided. Enjoy your randomly ordered sandwich!"
