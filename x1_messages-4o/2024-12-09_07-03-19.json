However, I am encountering an error with upgrading 'six' from version 1.4.1 to 1.9.0. I tried to upgrade 'six' separately but got the same error. Is this issue related to El Capitan and how can I resolve this problem? The error message is as follows:\n\n```\nCollecting nltk\n  Downloading nltk-3.0.5.tar.gz (1.0MB)\n    100% |\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588| 1.0MB 516kB/s \nCollecting six>=1.9.0 (from nltk)\n  Downloading six-1.9.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl\nInstalling collected packages: six, nltk\n  Found existing installation: six 1.4.1\n    DEPRECATION: Uninstalling a distutils installed project (six) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to the system Python on macOS El Capitan, which has certain restrictions due to System Integrity Protection (SIP). The issue arises because the `six` package is installed in a system directory that is protected by SIP, preventing modifications by user-installed software.\n\nHere are a few approaches you can try to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Use a Virtual Environment:**\n   One of the best practices for Python development is to use virtual environments. They allow you to manage dependencies separately from the system Python installation. You can create a virtual environment and install `nltk` within it:\n\n   ```bash\n   # Install virtualenv if not already installed\n   sudo pip install virtualenv\n\n   # Create a virtual environment in a directory, e.g., myenv\n   virtualenv myenv\n\n   # Activate the virtual environment\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n\n   # Now install nltk\n   pip install -U nltk\n   ```\n\n   Once you activate the virtual environment, you can work with `nltk` without affecting the system Python installation.\n\n2. **Use Homebrew to Install Python:**\n   Another approach is to install a separate version of Python using Homebrew, a package manager for macOS. This will allow you to install packages without interference from SIP:\n\n   ```bash\n   # Install Homebrew if not already installed\n   /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\n   # Install Python\n   brew install python\n\n   # This should install the latest Python version and pip\n   # Use pip to install nltk\n   pip3 install -U nltk\n   ```\n\n   This way, you can use `pip3` with the Homebrew-installed Python and avoid conflicts with the system Python.\n\n3. **Upgrade pip and setuptools:**\n   Sometimes, upgrading `pip` and `setuptools` can help resolve such issues:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo pip install --upgrade pip setuptools\n   ```\n\n   Then try installing `nltk` again.\n\nBy using any of these methods, you can avoid the restrictions imposed by SIP and manage your Python packages more effectively. Using virtual environments or a separate Python installation is generally recommended for development work."
