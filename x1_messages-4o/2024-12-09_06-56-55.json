        "content": "How can I correctly define a composite primary key in SQLAlchemy for a MySQL database? I am currently trying to create a table mapping for an existing table that has a composite primary key. However, when I add records to the table and attempt to work with the data, I receive a MySQL error (1062 Duplicate Entry). Here is my current implementation:\n\n```python\nclass table1(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'table1'\n\n    col1 = Column(String, primary_key=True)\n    col2 = Column(String, primary_key=True)\n    col3 = Column(String)\n\n    def __init__ = (self, col1, col2, col3):\n        self.col1 = col1\n        self.col2 = col2\n        self.col3 = col3\n\na = table1('test', 'test', 'test')\n\nsession.add(a)\nb = session.query(table1)\nfor instance in b:\n    print(instance.col1, instance.col2)\n```\n\nIf I try to work with a single-key table, I get the following error instead:\n```\nNew instance <table2 at 0x2f204d0> with identity key \n(<class '__main__.table2'>,('test',)) conflicts with \npersistent instance <table2 at 0x2f88770>\n```\nAm I defining the composite primary key incorrectly or is there another issue causing the MySQL error instead of a Python/SQLAlchemy error?"

        "content": "Your implementation of a composite primary key in SQLAlchemy seems mostly correct; however, there are a few things to watch out for that might help resolve the issues you're encountering.\n\n1. **Constructor Method**: The constructor method (`__init__`) should be defined with a colon (`:`) instead of an equal sign (`=`). The correct syntax should be:\n\n    ```python\n    def __init__(self, col1, col2, col3):\n        self.col1 = col1\n        self.col2 = col2\n        self.col3 = col3\n    ```\n\n2. **Session Management**: Ensure that your SQLAlchemy session is being managed correctly. Sessions should be used to maintain transactions, and you should commit changes to persist them in the database. Here\u2019s an example of how to properly manage sessions:\n\n    ```python\n    from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\n\n    Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\n    session = Session()\n\n    a = table1('test', 'test', 'test')\n    session.add(a)\n    session.commit()  # Commit to persist the changes\n\n    b = session.query(table1).all()\n    for instance in b:\n        print(instance.col1, instance.col2)\n    ```\n\n3. **Duplicate Entries**: The \"Duplicate Entry\" error suggests that you might be trying to add a record with a primary key that already exists in the database. Make sure you\u2019re not inadvertently adding the same record twice without committing it to the database in between.\n\n4. **Identity Map and Object States**: When adding or querying, be aware of SQLAlchemy's identity map, which is responsible for tracking instances. If you\u2019re adding an object with the same primary key as an already existing object in the session, SQLAlchemy will raise an error.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: To handle errors more gracefully, you can use try-except blocks around your session operations to catch exceptions and rollback transactions if necessary:\n\n    ```python\n    try:\n        a = table1('test', 'test', 'test')\n        session.add(a)\n        session.commit()\n    except Exception as e:\n        session.rollback()\n        print(f\"Error occurred: {e}\")\n    finally:\n        session.close()\n    ```\n\nBy ensuring these elements are correctly implemented and managing your sessions properly, you should be able to resolve the issues you're facing with duplicate entries and composite primary keys."
