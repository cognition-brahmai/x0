I only want max-age=300, not the max-age=1209600 line. When I perform a curl operation, as shown below, I get the duplicated Cache-Control header. How can I modify the Cache-Control header correctly to only show max-age=300?\n\n```bash\n$ curl -I http://my.url.here/\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Wed, 16 Apr 2014 14:24:22 GMT\nServer: Apache\nCache-Control: max-age=300\nContent-Length: 107993\nCache-Control: max-age=1209600\nExpires: Wed, 30 Apr 2014 14:24:22 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\n```"

        "content": "To address the issue of duplicate `Cache-Control` headers, it's important to understand why this might be happening. It seems that there is another layer, possibly your server (e.g., Apache or Nginx), that is adding an additional `Cache-Control` header. Here\u2019s how you can tackle this problem:\n\n### Solution 1: Modify Server Configuration\n\nIf your application is running behind a server like Apache or Nginx, it\u2019s likely that the server is adding its own `Cache-Control` header. You need to configure the server to stop adding this header or modify it to align with your desired settings.\n\n**For Apache:**\n- Open your Apache configuration file (e.g., `httpd.conf` or a specific site configuration file).\n- Look for any directives like `Header set Cache-Control` or `Header add Cache-Control`.\n- Modify or remove these directives as needed.\n\n**For Nginx:**\n- Open your Nginx configuration file (e.g., `nginx.conf` or a specific site configuration file).\n- Look for any directives like `add_header Cache-Control`.\n- Modify or remove these directives as needed.\n\n### Solution 2: Override the Existing Header in Flask\n\nIf modifying the server configuration is not feasible, you might need to ensure that your Flask application can override the existing headers. \n\nYou can try clearing the existing `Cache-Control` header before setting the new one:\n\n```python\n@app.after_request\ndef add_header(response):\n    # Remove existing Cache-Control header\n    response.headers.pop('Cache-Control', None)\n    # Set new Cache-Control header\n    response.headers['Cache-Control'] = 'max-age=300'\n    return response\n```\n\n### Solution 3: Use ProxyPass in Apache\n\nIf you are using Apache with `ProxyPass`, then sometimes the `Cache-Control` headers can be set by both the backend and frontend proxies. Ensure your proxy configuration doesn't add its own headers or properly forwards the headers from your Flask application.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy addressing the configuration of your web server or ensuring your application properly overrides existing headers, you should be able to control how the `Cache-Control` header is presented in the HTTP response. Make sure to restart your server after making changes to the configuration files to apply the updates."
