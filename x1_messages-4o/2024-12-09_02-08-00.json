Currently, I am using pandas and xlrd to read an Excel file and display its sheet names for the user's selection. However, due to the large size of the files (70 columns x 65k rows), it takes up to 14 seconds to load on a notebook. The same data in a CSV file only takes 3 seconds. The pandas code I am using is as follows:\n\n```python\nxls = pandas.ExcelFile(path)\nsheets = xls.sheet_names\n```\n\nAnd with xlrd, I am using:\n\n```python\nxls = xlrd.open_workbook(path)\nsheets = xls.sheet_names\n```\n\nIs there a quicker method to fetch the sheet names from an Excel file without reading the entire content?"

There are a few methods and optimizations you can try to speed up this process:\n\n1. **OpenPyXL**: This library can be a bit faster for some operations, especially with `.xlsx` files. You can use it to quickly get the sheet names without loading the entire file into memory.\n\n   ```python\n   from openpyxl import load_workbook\n\n   workbook = load_workbook(filename=path, read_only=True, data_only=True)\n   sheets = workbook.sheetnames\n   ```\n\n2. **Use `xlrd` for `.xls` files only**: If your files are in the older `.xls` format, `xlrd` is appropriate. However, for `.xlsx` files, using `openpyxl` or `pandas` with `engine='openpyxl'` might be faster.\n\n3. **Optimize pandas Excel engine**: If you are using `pandas` for `.xlsx` files, ensure you are using the `openpyxl` engine, which might give better performance.\n\n   ```python\n   xls = pandas.ExcelFile(path, engine='openpyxl')\n   sheets = xls.sheet_names\n   ```\n\n4. **Consider Excel file structure**: If you are able to control the file structure, keeping only necessary sheets and data can help with performance. Sometimes files have extra metadata or hidden sheets that could slow down operations.\n\n5. **Profile your code**: Use Python's profiling tools to check where the bottleneck is. This can help determine if the delay is truly from retrieving sheet names or some other part of your process.\n\n6. **Check for file corruption or complexity**: Sometimes files have issues like corruption or complex formatting that can slow down reading operations. Try with a simpler file to see if performance improves.\n\nBy trying these different approaches, you should be able to reduce the time it takes to retrieve sheet names from large Excel files."
