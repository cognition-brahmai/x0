        "content": "Yes, there are several statically typed languages that share similarities with Python and offer features like syntax support for dictionaries and array comprehensions, functions with keyword arguments, closures, tuple/multiple return values, runtime modification/creation of classes, and metaprogramming capabilities. Here are a few languages that meet most of these criteria:\n\n1. **Scala**: Scala is a statically typed language that runs on the JVM. It supports collections with comprehensive syntax, similar to Python's list comprehensions. Scala also supports higher-order functions, closures, and has a flexible type system that allows for some level of duck typing through implicit conversions. Scala's case classes provide a way to handle multiple return values, and it also supports metaprogramming through macros and reflection.\n\n2. **Kotlin**: Also running on the JVM, Kotlin offers many modern language features and has a syntax that's more concise than Java. It supports collections with expressive functions (like `map`, `filter`) that provide a Pythonic feel. Kotlin supports default and named arguments (similar to keyword arguments), multiple return values can be managed using data classes or pairs, and it allows for reflection and annotations for metaprogramming.\n\n3. **TypeScript**: While primarily a superset of JavaScript, TypeScript adds static typing and has features that align with your requirements. TypeScript allows for object literals (similar to Python dictionaries), supports closures, and has tuple types. Though it doesn't natively support all Python-like features, TypeScript's extensive use of interfaces and type inference reduces the need for explicit class definitions, and it offers decorators for metaprogramming.\n\n4. **Swift**: Developed by Apple, Swift is used for iOS and macOS development but has features like Python. Swift supports dictionaries and array comprehensions, closures, and tuples for multiple return values. It offers protocol-oriented programming, which reduces the need for explicit classes, and has metaprogramming capabilities through reflection and dynamic features.\n\n5. **Rust**: Although Rust is primarily known for its memory safety and performance, it has an expressive type system and supports closures. Rust provides tuples for multiple return values and supports metaprogramming through macros. While it doesn't have runtime class modification, its trait system offers flexibility similar to duck typing.\n\nEach of these languages has its strengths and trade-offs, but they all offer a blend of static typing with some of the dynamic features that make Python popular."
