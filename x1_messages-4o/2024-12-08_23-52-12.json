In addition to returning a list of the top 5 most populous cities not found in any other files, the function should now also include the median income for each of the top 5 cities. The function should also filter out any cities with a population under 500,000 and an average temperature above 80\u00b0F. The final output should be formatted as: \"The top 5 unique cities by population and median income are: [city1] (median income: $[income1]), [city2] (median income: $[income2]), [city3] (median income: $[income3]), [city4] (median income: $[income4]), and [city5] (median income: $[income5]).\" Additionally, please refer to the given prompt for formatting of the input and output."

        "content": "To achieve the desired functionality, we need to process a list of JSON files containing information about US cities. The function should filter cities based on population and temperature criteria, identify unique cities across files, sort them by population, and finally format the output with their median incomes. Below is a Python function that implements this:\n\n```python\nimport json\nfrom statistics import median\n\ndef process_city_files(file_list):\n    all_cities = {}\n\n    # Read and process each JSON file\n    for file_path in file_list:\n        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n            data = json.load(file)\n            for city in data:\n                # Extract city data\n                name = city['name']\n                population = city['population']\n                median_income = city['median_income']\n                average_temp = city['average_temperature']\n\n                # Apply filters\n                if population >= 500000 and average_temp <= 80:\n                    if name not in all_cities:\n                        all_cities[name] = {\n                            'population': population,\n                            'median_income': median_income\n                        }\n                    else:\n                        # Update only if the current city has a higher population\n                        if population > all_cities[name]['population']:\n                            all_cities[name] = {\n                                'population': population,\n                                'median_income': median_income\n                            }\n\n    # Sort cities by population in descending order\n    sorted_cities = sorted(all_cities.items(), key=lambda x: x[1]['population'], reverse=True)\n\n    # Get the top 5 unique cities by population\n    top_cities = sorted_cities[:5]\n\n    # Format the output\n    result = \"The top 5 unique cities by population and median income are: \"\n    formatted_cities = [\n        f\"{city[0]} (median income: ${city[1]['median_income']})\"\n        for city in top_cities\n    ]\n    result += \", \".join(formatted_cities[:-1]) + \", and \" + formatted_cities[-1] + \".\"\n\n    return result\n\n# Example usage (assuming 'file_list' is a list of file paths to JSON files):\n# file_list = ['cities1.json', 'cities2.json', ...]\n# print(process_city_files(file_list))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Reading JSON Files**: The function iterates through each file in the `file_list`, reading the JSON content into a Python dictionary.\n\n2. **Filtering**: For each city, it checks if the population is at least 500,000 and the average temperature is 80\u00b0F or lower. Only cities meeting these criteria are considered.\n\n3. **Handling Unique Cities**: The function uses a dictionary, `all_cities`, to store each city's name as the key and a dictionary containing its population and median income as the value. If a city appears in multiple files, only the entry with the highest population is retained.\n\n4. **Sorting and Selecting Top 5**: After processing all files, the cities are sorted by population in descending order, and the top 5 cities are selected.\n\n5. **Formatting Output**: The selected cities are formatted into the required string, listing each city with its median income.\n\nThis function should be run in an environment where the JSON files are accessible and correctly formatted as expected."
