        "content": "In TensorFlow, both `tf.add(x, y)` and `x + y` are used to perform element-wise addition of tensors `x` and `y`. The primary difference between the two is syntactic, as both will produce the same computation graph and perform the same underlying operation.\n\n### Differences:\n\n1. **Readability and Conciseness**: \n   - Using the `+` operator is more concise and can be more readable, especially for those who are familiar with Python's native operations.\n   - `tf.add(x, y)` is more explicit, which might be preferable in cases where you want to make the operation clear to someone reading your code.\n\n2. **Operation Overloading**:\n   - TensorFlow overloads basic arithmetic operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and others for `tf.Tensor` objects. This means that when you use `x + y`, TensorFlow internally calls the appropriate TensorFlow function, such as `tf.add(x, y)`.\n\n3. **Compatibility and Consistency**:\n   - In older versions of TensorFlow (especially pre-2.x), there were more distinctions in how eager execution and graph construction worked. However, in TensorFlow 2.x and later, eager execution is enabled by default, and the behavior between `+` and `tf.add()` is consistent.\n\n4. **Custom Gradient Functions**:\n   - There is typically no notable difference when you define custom gradient functions. However, using TensorFlow functions can sometimes make the code more explicitly compatible with TensorFlow's gradient computation and optimization routines.\n\n### Computation Graph:\n\nWhether you use `x + y` or `tf.add(x, y)`, the computation graph remains the same. TensorFlow abstracts the details of the graph construction, and both methods ultimately add a node to the graph that represents the addition operation.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nIn practice, you can use either `x + y` or `tf.add(x, y)` based on your preference for readability and explicitness. The operations are overloaded for tensors to allow Pythonic syntax while maintaining the power and flexibility of TensorFlow's computational framework."
