But here's the challenge: Can you modify this command so that it only searches files that have been modified in the last 24 hours? Put your reasoning skills to the test and come up with the updated command. Good luck!"

        "content": "To modify the command so that it only searches files that have been modified in the last 24 hours, you can use the `find` command in combination with `grep`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```bash\nfind /path/to/search -type f -mtime -1 -exec grep 'search term' {} +\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `find /path/to/search`: This starts the `find` command in the specified directory.\n- `-type f`: This option tells `find` to only look for files.\n- `-mtime -1`: This option tells `find` to look for files modified in the last 24 hours (`-1` means less than 1 day).\n- `-exec grep 'search term' {} +`: This part executes `grep` on the files found. `{}` is a placeholder for the found files, and `+` allows `find` to pass multiple files at a time to `grep`, which is more efficient than executing `grep` for each file individually.\n\nThis command will efficiently search only the files that have been modified in the last 24 hours for the given \"search term\"."
