Here's how you can write the Swift code:\n\n```swift\nfunc canAccessPremiumFeatures(isLoggedIn: Bool, isAccountVerified: Bool) -> Bool {\n    // Check if the user is logged in and their account is verified\n    if isLoggedIn && isAccountVerified {\n        return true // The user can access premium features\n    } else {\n        return false // The user cannot access premium features\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nlet userLoggedIn = true\nlet userAccountVerified = true\n\nlet hasAccess = canAccessPremiumFeatures(isLoggedIn: userLoggedIn, isAccountVerified: userAccountVerified)\nprint(\"User can access premium features: \\(hasAccess)\")\n```\n\nThis function `canAccessPremiumFeatures` takes two Boolean parameters: `isLoggedIn` and `isAccountVerified`. It returns `true` if both conditions are satisfied (i.e., the user is logged in and their account is verified), and `false` otherwise. This logic aligns with the logical statement provided."
