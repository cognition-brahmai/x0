I also tried with `genfromtxt('All.csv',delimiter=',', dtype=float16)` but the issue persists. How should I solve this memory management issue? Should I try a distributed approach?"

        "content": "To handle large CSV files efficiently without running into memory issues, you can use a few strategies. Here are some tips and alternatives to consider:\n\n1. **Use Pandas with `chunk_size`:**\n   Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, and it provides efficient ways to handle large datasets by processing them in chunks.\n\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n\n   # Define the chunk size\n   chunk_size = 10**6  # Adjust based on your memory constraints\n   medians = []\n\n   # Read the CSV file in chunks\n   for chunk in pd.read_csv('All.csv', chunksize=chunk_size):\n       # Calculate median for each column in chunk and append\n       medians.append(chunk.median())\n\n   # Calculate overall median for each column\n   overall_median = pd.concat(medians, axis=1).median(axis=1)\n   print(overall_median)\n   ```\n\n2. **Dask Library:**\n   Dask is designed for big data and can process data in parallel across multiple cores.\n\n   ```python\n   import dask.dataframe as dd\n\n   # Read the CSV file with Dask\n   df = dd.read_csv('All.csv')\n\n   # Compute the median for each column\n   medians = df.median().compute()\n   print(medians)\n   ```\n\n3. **Optimize Memory Usage:**\n   - Use appropriate data types: Ensure that you're using the most memory-efficient data types for your data. For instance, if your data are integers within a small range, consider using `int8` or `int16` instead of `int64`.\n   - Use `float32` instead of `float64` if precision is not critical for your application.\n\n4. **Increase Swap File Size:**\n   If possible, increase the swap file size on your system to allow more virtual memory usage. This is more of a system-level tweak and should be used cautiously as it can slow down your system.\n\n5. **Distributed Computing:**\n   If the data is too large to handle on a single machine, consider a distributed computing framework like Spark, which can distribute the data and computation across multiple nodes.\n\nBy using one of these approaches, you should be able to overcome the memory limitations and successfully compute the column-wise medians for your large CSV file."
