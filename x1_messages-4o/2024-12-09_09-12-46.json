Here's a basic query that demonstrates how to do this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records\nFROM your_table_name;\n```\n\nReplace `your_table_name` with the actual name of the table you're interested in. The result will give you a single value representing the total number of records in that table."
