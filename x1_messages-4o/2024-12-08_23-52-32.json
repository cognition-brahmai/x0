For example, stars like the Sun and Betelgeuse are categorized by their nuclear fusion processes and lifecycle stages, while black holes like Sagittarius A* are defined by their intense gravitational fields and singularities. Artificial objects like the Voyager 1 and ISS represent human endeavours in space exploration and habitation."
