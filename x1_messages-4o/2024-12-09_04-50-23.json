Try using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead\"? I have a dataframe 'df' like this:\n\n```\n  A     B     C\n a.1   b.1   c.1\n a.2   b.2   c.2\n a.3   b.3   c.3\n```\n\nI extract all the rows from 'df' where column 'B' has a value of 'b.2' and assign these results to 'df_2' using the code:\n\n```\ndf_2 = df[df['B'] == 'b.2']\n```\n\n'df_2' then becomes:\n\n```\n  A     B     C\n a.2   b.2   c.2\n```\n\nI then try to copy all the values in column 'B' to a new column named 'D' using the code:\n\n```\ndf_2['D'] = df_2['B']\n```\n\nBut I get the warning message. I have also tried using 'loc' when creating 'df_2' like this:\n\n```\ndf_2 = df.loc[df['B'] == 'b.2']\n```\n\nBut I still get the warning. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The warning you're encountering is due to pandas trying to prevent you from unintentionally modifying a slice of the original DataFrame, which can lead to unexpected results. To address this warning, you can create a copy of the DataFrame explicitly before making modifications. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Create a copy of the filtered DataFrame using the `.copy()` method. This ensures that any changes you make to `df_2` do not affect the original DataFrame `df`.\n\n2. Then, you can safely assign the values from column 'B' to the new column 'D'.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Original DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    'A': ['a.1', 'a.2', 'a.3'],\n    'B': ['b.1', 'b.2', 'b.3'],\n    'C': ['c.1', 'c.2', 'c.3']\n})\n\n# Extract rows where column 'B' has a value 'b.2' and make a copy\ndf_2 = df[df['B'] == 'b.2'].copy()\n\n# Copy values from column 'B' to new column 'D'\ndf_2['D'] = df_2['B']\n\nprint(df_2)\n```\n\nBy using `.copy()`, you avoid the warning and ensure that `df_2` is a separate DataFrame with its own memory allocation."
