It is a sequence of instructions that can be followed to achieve a desired outcome, often used in computer programming and data processing. Algorithms can be expressed in various forms, including natural language, pseudocode, flowcharts, or programming languages, and they are fundamental to the fields of computer science, mathematics, and engineering. An effective algorithm should be clear, efficient, and capable of handling all possible inputs to produce the correct output."
