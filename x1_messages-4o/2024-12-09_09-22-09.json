        "content": "Certainly! To design a data structure in C++ that stores information about students, you can use a `struct` or a `class`. Here, I'll demonstrate how you can use a `struct` to store each student's information, and then you can use a `vector` to manage a collection of students.\n\nHere is an example code:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <string>\n\n// Define a struct to store student information\nstruct Student {\n    std::string name;\n    int id;\n    std::string course;\n\n    // Constructor for easy initialization\n    Student(const std::string& studentName, int studentId, const std::string& studentCourse)\n        : name(studentName), id(studentId), course(studentCourse) {}\n};\n\n// Function to print student details\nvoid printStudentDetails(const Student& student) {\n    std::cout << \"Name: \" << student.name << \", ID: \" << student.id << \", Course: \" << student.course << std::endl;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    // Create a vector to store multiple students\n    std::vector<Student> students;\n\n    // Add students to the vector\n    students.emplace_back(\"Alice\", 101, \"Mathematics\");\n    students.emplace_back(\"Bob\", 102, \"Physics\");\n    students.emplace_back(\"Charlie\", 103, \"Computer Science\");\n\n    // Print details of each student\n    for (const auto& student : students) {\n        printStudentDetails(student);\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`struct Student`**: This structure holds the details of a student, including their name, ID, and course.\n- **`vector<Student> students`**: A `vector` is used to store a list of students. It allows dynamic resizing and is suitable for managing collections.\n- **`emplace_back`**: This method is used to add new students to the vector. It constructs the student objects in place, which can be more efficient than `push_back`.\n- **`printStudentDetails`**: A helper function to neatly print the details of each student.\n\nThis code provides a basic framework for managing student information. You can extend it by adding features such as searching, sorting, or modifying student records."
