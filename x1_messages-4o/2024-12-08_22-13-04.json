        "content": "Certainly! To accomplish this task, I'll guide you through the process of converting the octal number 10 to its binary representation using JavaScript. Additionally, I'll include a table that shows the decimal equivalent of the first 10 octal numbers.\n\n### Table: Decimal Equivalent of the First 10 Octal Numbers\n\n| Octal | Decimal |\n|-------|---------|\n| 0     | 0       |\n| 1     | 1       |\n| 2     | 2       |\n| 3     | 3       |\n| 4     | 4       |\n| 5     | 5       |\n| 6     | 6       |\n| 7     | 7       |\n| 10    | 8       |\n| 11    | 9       |\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Convert Octal 10 to Binary\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: The input is provided in a JSON format. Let's assume the JSON is:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"base\": 8,\n     \"number\": \"10\"\n   }\n   ```\n   Here, `\"base\": 8` indicates that the number is in octal format, and the `\"number\": \"10\"` is the octal number we need to convert.\n\n2. **Convert Octal to Decimal**: The first step in the conversion process is to convert the octal number to its decimal equivalent.\n   - The octal number `10` corresponds to \\(1 \\times 8^1 + 0 \\times 8^0 = 8 + 0 = 8\\).\n   - Thus, octal `10` is equivalent to decimal `8`.\n\n3. **Convert Decimal to Binary**: Now, we convert the decimal number `8` to its binary representation.\n   - **Divide by 2**: Start dividing the number by 2 and record the remainder.\n     - 8 \u00f7 2 = 4, remainder = 0\n     - 4 \u00f7 2 = 2, remainder = 0\n     - 2 \u00f7 2 = 1, remainder = 0\n     - 1 \u00f7 2 = 0, remainder = 1\n   - **Read Remainders in Reverse**: The binary representation is obtained by reading the remainders from bottom to top, which gives us `1000`.\n\n4. **Implementation in JavaScript**: Below is the JavaScript code that performs these conversions.\n\n   ```javascript\n   // Function to convert octal to decimal\n   function octalToDecimal(octal) {\n     return parseInt(octal, 8);\n   }\n\n   // Function to convert decimal to binary\n   function decimalToBinary(decimal) {\n     return decimal.toString(2);\n   }\n\n   // Input JSON\n   const input = {\n     base: 8,\n     number: \"10\"\n   };\n\n   // Convert octal to decimal\n   const decimal = octalToDecimal(input.number);\n\n   // Convert decimal to binary\n   const binary = decimalToBinary(decimal);\n\n   // Output the result\n   console.log(`Octal ${input.number} is Decimal ${decimal} and Binary ${binary}`);\n   // Output: Octal 10 is Decimal 8 and Binary 1000\n   ```\n\nThis code effectively takes the octal input, converts it to decimal, and then converts that decimal to binary, providing the full conversion process step-by-step."
