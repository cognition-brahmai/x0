        "content": "This C++ code is designed to randomly select a factor from a given list, based on a set of weights, and then use that selected factor to construct a thesis statement. Let's break down how the code works and what each part does:\n\n1. **Include Necessary Headers:**\n   - The code includes the necessary headers for input/output operations and to work with vectors, time, and random number generation.\n\n2. **Declare and Initialize Vectors:**\n   - `factors`: A vector of strings containing various factors related to cybercrime.\n   - `weights`: A vector of doubles representing the probability weights for each factor.\n\n3. **Random Number Generation:**\n   - `srand(time(NULL))`: Seeds the random number generator with the current time to ensure different sequences of random numbers each time the program is run.\n   - `rand() / (RAND_MAX)`: Generates a random number between 0 and 1.\n\n4. **Select a Random Factor Based on Weights:**\n   - The code iterates over the `weights` vector, accumulating the total weight.\n   - If the accumulated weight is greater than or equal to the generated random number, it breaks out of the loop, selecting the corresponding factor.\n\n5. **Construct Thesis Statement:**\n   - `randomFactor`: The factor selected based on the random number and weights.\n   - `thesisStatement`: Constructs a statement using the selected random factor.\n\n6. **Output the Thesis Statement:**\n   - The constructed thesis statement is printed to the console.\n\n**Expected Output:**\nThe output will be a thesis statement that attributes the rise in cybercrimes to one of the factors in the list. The example output could be:\n\n```\nThe rise in cybercrimes can be attributed to Education and Awareness among other factors.\n```\n\nThe specific factor chosen will vary each time the program is run due to the random selection process, influenced by the weights provided. For example, \"Inadequate Cybersecurity Measures\" has the highest weight (0.30) and thus is more likely to be selected compared to \"Cybercrime as a Lucrative Industry\" which has the lowest weight (0.10)."
