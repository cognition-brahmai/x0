I want this new column to contain the string \"high\" if the \"consumption_energy\" value > 400, \"medium\" if the \"consumption_energy\" value is between 200 and 400, and \"low\" if the \"consumption_energy\" value is under 200. I initially attempted to use numpy's \"where\" function but I found that it can only deal with two conditions, not three like in my case. Can anyone suggest a way to achieve this?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this using the `apply` function along with a custom function or by using `numpy.select` for multiple conditions. Here's how you can do it using both methods:\n\n### Method 1: Using `apply` with a custom function\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndf_energy = pd.DataFrame({\n    'consumption_energy': [100, 250, 300, 450, 150]\n})\n\n# Define a function to classify the energy consumption\ndef classify_energy(consumption):\n    if consumption > 400:\n        return 'high'\n    elif 200 < consumption <= 400:\n        return 'medium'\n    else:\n        return 'low'\n\n# Apply the function to create the new column\ndf_energy['energy_class'] = df_energy['consumption_energy'].apply(classify_energy)\n\nprint(df_energy)\n```\n\n### Method 2: Using `numpy.select`\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndf_energy = pd.DataFrame({\n    'consumption_energy': [100, 250, 300, 450, 150]\n})\n\n# Define conditions\nconditions = [\n    (df_energy['consumption_energy'] > 400),\n    (df_energy['consumption_energy'] > 200) & (df_energy['consumption_energy'] <= 400),\n    (df_energy['consumption_energy'] <= 200)\n]\n\n# Define choices\nchoices = ['high', 'medium', 'low']\n\n# Use numpy.select to apply the conditions and choices\ndf_energy['energy_class'] = np.select(conditions, choices)\n\nprint(df_energy)\n```\n\nBoth methods will yield the same result, and you can choose based on your preference or specific use case. The `numpy.select` method is typically more efficient for larger datasets, while the `apply` method with a custom function can be more readable."
