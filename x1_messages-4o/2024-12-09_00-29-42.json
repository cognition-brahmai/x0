This is the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nX = np.random.randn(8,4)\n[[X[i,j] for i in X] for j in X[i]]\n```\n\nHowever, I'm encountering an `IndexError: arrays used as indices must be of integer (or boolean) type`. What is an easy way to accomplish this task without using `range(len(X))`?"

        "content": "The issue with your current code is that you are trying to iterate over the elements of `X` directly when using the list comprehension, rather than iterating over indices. This results in attempting to use entire rows of `X` as indices, which causes the `IndexError`. To fix this, you can use NumPy's built-in functions that allow array manipulation without explicitly iterating over indices.\n\nHere's how you can achieve your goal using NumPy functions and list comprehension:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nX = np.random.randn(8, 4)\n\n# Transpose the array to switch rows and columns\n# Use list comprehension to iterate over the transposed array\nresult = [[element for element in column] for column in X.T]\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `X.T` transposes the array `X`, effectively switching its rows and columns. This way, iterating over `X.T` allows you to access the columns of the original array as rows of the transposed array.\n- The list comprehension `[[element for element in column] for column in X.T]` iterates over each column in the transposed array and extracts elements, effectively giving you columns of the original array as lists.\n\nThis approach avoids using explicit indices and leverages NumPy's capabilities to manipulate arrays efficiently."
