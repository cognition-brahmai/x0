        "content": "In Ruby, the concept of a docstring, like in Python, isn't natively supported in the same way. However, you can document your Ruby code using comments and the RDoc system, which can generate documentation from your code comments. If you want to access documentation or comments programmatically, you would typically need to parse the comments yourself.\n\nHowever, you can use a workaround by defining a method to return the documentation string. Here's a simple example:\n\n```ruby\nclass MyClass\n  def self.docstring\n    \"This is the documentation for MyClass.\"\n  end\nend\n\nputs MyClass.docstring\n```\n\nIn this example, `MyClass.docstring` acts similarly to accessing a docstring in Python. This is a manual approach and requires you to define such methods yourself.\n\nFor more comprehensive documentation, Ruby developers often use tools like RDoc or YARD to generate documentation from comments in the code. These tools parse specially formatted comments and produce documentation in HTML or other formats, but they are not accessible at runtime in the same way Python's `__doc__` attribute is."
