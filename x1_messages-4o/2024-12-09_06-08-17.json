I've got an array, y, with (2,) dimensions as shown below:\n\n```python\nA=np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])\nx=np.array([1,2])\ny=np.dot(A,x)\ny.shape\n# Output: (2,)\n```\n\nHowever, when I modify x slightly, the result, y2, ends up with (2,1) dimensions:\n\n```python\nx2=x[:,np.newaxis]\ny2=np.dot(A,x2)\ny2.shape\n# Output: (2, 1)\n```\n\nI'm wondering what would be the most efficient way to convert y2 back to the same dimensions as y, without copying. Can you help me solve this problem?"

        "content": "To convert `y2` from shape `(2, 1)` to shape `(2,)` without copying the data, you can use the `numpy.squeeze()` function. This function removes dimensions of size 1 from the shape of an array, effectively flattening it where possible. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ny2 = np.dot(A, x2)\ny2_flat = np.squeeze(y2)\n```\n\nNow, `y2_flat` should have the shape `(2,)`, just like `y`. The `squeeze()` function is efficient because it does not involve copying data; instead, it returns a view of the original data whenever possible.\n\nRemember that `squeeze()` will remove any dimensions of size 1 from the shape, so use it cautiously if your array might have other singleton dimensions that you want to keep. In this case, since `y2` only has one singleton dimension at the end, `squeeze()` works perfectly to get the desired result."
