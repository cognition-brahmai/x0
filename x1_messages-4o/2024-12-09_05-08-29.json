        "content": "The error you're encountering indicates that the TensorFlow graph you are using does not contain a tensor with the name `DecodeJpeg/contents:0`, which is crucial for the image input pipeline. This is likely due to a mismatch between the graph structure expected by the script and the actual structure of your retrained graph.\n\nHere are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify Graph and Tensor Names**:\n   - Ensure that the graph you are loading (`/tmp/output_graph.pb`) contains the operations and tensors with the expected names. You can inspect the graph definition using TensorFlow's `tf.compat.v1.GraphDef` and print out the names of operations and tensors.\n\n2. **Update the Input Node Name**:\n   - The name `DecodeJpeg/contents:0` is typically used in older versions of TensorFlow scripts. In newer scripts or models, the input tensor might have a different name. Double-check the script and model documentation for the correct input tensor name.\n   - You can use TensorBoard or a similar tool to visualize the graph and identify the correct tensor names.\n\n3. **Check Script Compatibility**:\n   - Ensure that the script you're using (`label_image.py`) is compatible with the version of TensorFlow and the specific model graph you have. Scripts can change with updates, so ensure you are using a script version that matches your TensorFlow version.\n\n4. **Modify the Script**:\n   - If the input tensor name has changed, you can modify the script to use the correct tensor name. For example, if the input tensor is now named `input:0`, you would update the `feed_dict` key in your script accordingly.\n\n5. **TensorFlow Version**:\n   - Make sure that you are using a compatible version of TensorFlow for both your model and the script. Sometimes, models and scripts are version-specific, and using an incompatible version can result in such errors.\n\n6. **Re-export the Model**:\n   - If possible, try retraining and re-exporting the model to ensure that the graph is correctly structured. This can sometimes resolve issues where the graph has been improperly exported or altered.\n\nBy going through these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue regarding the missing tensor in your TensorFlow graph. If you continue to encounter issues, consider consulting the TensorFlow documentation or community forums for additional assistance."
