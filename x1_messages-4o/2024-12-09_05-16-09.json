        "content": "In Python, the `super()` function is used to call methods from a parent class. When the Python documentation mentions that a \"super object returned is unbound,\" it refers to a situation where the `super()` call is made with only one argument, typically the class itself, and not the instance. This means that the `super` object isn't tied to a specific instance of the class, and you can't directly call instance methods through it until it is bound to an instance.\n\n### Using `super()` with Only One Argument\n\nHere's a breakdown of how `super()` can be used with one argument and what it implies:\n\n1. **One-Argument `super()`**: When you use `super()` with only one argument, you provide the class itself. This is typically used when you want to access the parent class methods in a class method or a static method, where you don't have a specific instance.\n\n   ```python\n   class A:\n       def method(self):\n           print(\"Method in A\")\n\n   class B(A):\n       @classmethod\n       def method(cls):\n           print(\"Method in B\")\n           super(B).method(cls)  # Super with one argument\n\n   B.method()\n   ```\n\n   In this example, `super(B).method(cls)` is used in a class method context. Since class methods receive the class as the first argument, you pass `cls` when you call the method through the super object.\n\n2. **Unbound Super Object**: The term \"unbound\" here means that the `super` object isn't associated with any specific instance of the class. When you later call a method on it, you need to pass an instance of the class manually if you're calling an instance method.\n\n### Practical Example\n\nIf you want to call `super()` in a normal instance method with only one argument, you can do so, but you must provide the instance explicitly when you call methods on the super object:\n\n```python\nclass A:\n    def method(self):\n        print(\"Method in A\")\n\nclass B(A):\n    def method(self):\n        print(\"Method in B\")\n        super(B).method(self)  # Super with one argument, instance passed manually\n\ninstance = B()\ninstance.method()\n```\n\nIn this example, `super(B).method(self)` is used to call the method in class `A`, and `self` is passed manually because `super()` is unbound to any instance.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUsing `super()` with one argument is less common and typically used in scenarios where you don't have an instance available, like in class methods or static methods. If you are within an instance method, it's more common and straightforward to use `super()` without arguments, which automatically binds to the current instance and class."
