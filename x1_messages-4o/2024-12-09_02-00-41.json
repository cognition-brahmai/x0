I want to separate these functions into a different file, but I'm struggling to find a good way to do this. Currently, I am using a separate file to define some functions and then calling them in the main class from the main file. However, this approach seems repetitive and forces me to change arguments for both instances of the function. How can I improve this?\n\nHere's my current setup:\n\nFile main.py\n```python\nimport separate\n\nclass MainClass(object):\n    self.global_var_1 = ...\n    self.global_var_2 = ...\n\n    def func_1(self, x, y):\n        ...\n    def func_2(self, z):\n        ...\n    # tons of similar functions, and then the ones I moved out:\n\n    def long_func_1(self, a, b):\n        return separate.long_func_1(self, a, b)\n```\n\nFile separate.py\n```python\ndef long_func_1(obj, a, b):\n    if obj.global_var_1:\n        ...\n    obj.func_2(z)\n    ...\n    return ...\n# Lots of other similar functions that use info from MainClass\n```\nI create an object from the main class as `obj_1 = MainClass()` and I want to call the function as `obj_1.long_func_1(a, b)` instead of `separate.long_func_1(obj_1, a, b)`. Is there a better solution to this?"

        "content": "To better organize your class methods across multiple files while retaining the ability to call them as methods of the class, you can utilize Python's ability to extend classes by importing methods from other modules. This approach involves defining your methods in separate files and then incorporating them into your main class using mixins or utility functions. Here's a streamlined way to achieve this:\n\n### Step 1: Use Mixins or Utility Functions\n\nYou can define your additional methods in a separate file and then incorporate them into your main class. This can be done using mixins or by importing functions and assigning them as methods.\n\n#### 1.1 Using Mixins\n\nMixins are a way to create reusable sets of methods that can be added to any class. Define a separate class for each group of related methods and let your main class inherit from these mixins.\n\n**File: `mixins.py`**\n```python\nclass LongFuncMixin:\n    def long_func_1(self, a, b):\n        if self.global_var_1:\n            ...\n        self.func_2(z)\n        ...\n        return ...\n\n    # Other similar long functions can be added here as methods\n```\n\n**File: `main.py`**\n```python\nfrom mixins import LongFuncMixin\n\nclass MainClass(LongFuncMixin):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.global_var_1 = ...\n        self.global_var_2 = ...\n\n    def func_1(self, x, y):\n        ...\n\n    def func_2(self, z):\n        ...\n\n# Now you can create an object and call the mixed-in method\nobj_1 = MainClass()\nresult = obj_1.long_func_1(a, b)\n```\n\n### Step 2: Alternative with Utility Functions\n\nIf you prefer not to use inheritance, you can import the functions and bind them to the class as methods manually. This can be useful when the functions don't logically belong to a separate class.\n\n**File: `utilities.py`**\n```python\ndef long_func_1(self, a, b):\n    if self.global_var_1:\n        ...\n    self.func_2(z)\n    ...\n    return ...\n```\n\n**File: `main.py`**\n```python\nimport utilities\n\nclass MainClass:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.global_var_1 = ...\n        self.global_var_2 = ...\n\n    def func_1(self, x, y):\n        ...\n\n    def func_2(self, z):\n        ...\n\n# Bind the utility function as a method of the class\nMainClass.long_func_1 = utilities.long_func_1\n\n# Now you can use the function like any other method\nobj_1 = MainClass()\nresult = obj_1.long_func_1(a, b)\n```\n\n### Summary\n\nBy using mixins or binding utility functions as methods, you can keep your class organized and modular without duplicating code or altering the method signatures. This allows you to maintain the structure of calling methods directly on class instances, keeping your code clean and maintainable."
