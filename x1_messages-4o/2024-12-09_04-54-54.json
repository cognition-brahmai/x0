        "content": "To create a PDF with multiple pages using ReportLab in your Django application, you need to call the `showPage()` method between the content for each page. This method tells the canvas to finish drawing the current page and to start a new one. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nfrom reportlab.pdfgen import canvas\nfrom django.http import HttpResponse\n\ndef Print_PDF(request):\n    response = HttpResponse(content_type='application/pdf')\n    response['Content-Disposition'] = 'attachment; filename=\"resume.pdf\"'\n\n    p = canvas.Canvas(response)\n\n    # First page\n    p.drawString(100, 100, \"Some text in first page.\")\n    p.showPage()  # End of first page\n\n    # Second page\n    p.drawString(100, 100, \"Some text in second page.\")\n    p.showPage()  # End of second page\n\n    # Third page\n    p.drawString(100, 100, \"Some text in third page\")\n    p.showPage()  # End of third page\n\n    p.save()\n    return response\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- The `p.showPage()` method is crucial as it finalizes the current page and moves to the next one.\n- Ensure that you set the content for each page between calls to `showPage()`.\n- Adjust the coordinates of `drawString()` or other drawing methods as needed for your content layout on each page. \n\nThis code will generate a PDF with three pages, each containing the specified text. Adjust the content and coordinates as necessary to fit your design needs."
