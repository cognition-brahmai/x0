How do I remove 'one delay' to solve this? Also, is there a function that can be output from this so I can use it repeatedly?

        "content": "To address the lag in your predictions using MATLAB's Neural Network Toolbox, you'll need to modify the network to provide predictions one step earlier, i.e., predicting \\( y(t+1) \\) when \\( y(t) \\) is available. You're on the right track with the \"Early Prediction Network\" section. Let me guide you through the process of removing one delay and setting this up for repeated predictions.\n\n### Removing One Delay\n\nThe `removedelay` function is used to shift the network's predictions one time step earlier. This is achieved by reducing the feedback delays by one, essentially allowing the network to operate with a minimum tap delay of 0 instead of 1.\n\nHere's how you can adjust your code to remove one delay:\n\n1. **Remove One Delay using `removedelay`:**\n\n   ```matlab\n   % Create an Early Prediction Network\n   nets = removedelay(net);\n   [xs,xis,ais,ts] = preparets(nets,{},{},targetSeries);\n   ys = nets(xs,xis,ais);\n   earlyPerformance = perform(nets,ts,ys);\n   ```\n\n   This `nets` network will now predict \\( y(t+1) \\) based on \\( y(t) \\).\n\n2. **Function for Repeated Predictions:**\n\n   To use the network repeatedly without retraining each time new data is available, you can save the network after training and load it when needed for predictions. Here's how you can create a function to do this:\n\n   ```matlab\n   function predictedValue = predictNextValue(trainedNet, newInputSeries)\n       % Prepare the new input data for the trained network\n       newInputSeries = tonndata(newInputSeries,false,false);\n       [xs,xis,ais] = preparets(trainedNet,{},{},newInputSeries);\n       \n       % Predict the next value\n       ys = trainedNet(xs,xis,ais);\n       predictedValue = ys{end};\n   end\n   ```\n\n   You can save the trained network using:\n\n   ```matlab\n   save('trainedNets.mat', 'nets');\n   ```\n\n   And reload it when needed:\n\n   ```matlab\n   load('trainedNets.mat', 'nets');\n   ```\n\n3. **Retraining Strategy:**\n\n   You do not necessarily need to retrain the network every time you receive new data. However, periodically retraining can help maintain prediction accuracy if the underlying data distribution changes significantly over time. You can decide on a retraining schedule based on your application's requirements and the rate of change in the data.\n\nUsing these steps, you can adjust your neural network to predict future values accurately and set up a system for repeated predictions."
