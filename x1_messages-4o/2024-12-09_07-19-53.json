        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to the `sendfile` function, which is not declared in the expected way for C99 standards on macOS Big Sur. This is a known issue when trying to compile older versions of Python on newer macOS versions. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to resolve this issue and successfully install Python 3.6.13 using `pyenv`.\n\n### Solution:\n\n1. **Install Xcode Command Line Tools:**\n\n   Make sure you have the Xcode command line tools installed. You can do this by running:\n   ```bash\n   xcode-select --install\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Required Dependencies:**\n\n   Use Homebrew to install required dependencies. If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can install it first by following instructions from [Homebrew's official website](https://brew.sh/).\n\n   Then, install the dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   brew install openssl readline sqlite3 xz zlib tcl-tk\n   ```\n\n3. **Set Environment Variables:**\n\n   Set the necessary environment variables to help `pyenv` find the required libraries:\n   ```bash\n   export LDFLAGS=\"-L/usr/local/opt/zlib/lib -L/usr/local/opt/sqlite/lib\"\n   export CPPFLAGS=\"-I/usr/local/opt/zlib/include -I/usr/local/opt/sqlite/include\"\n   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/zlib/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/opt/sqlite/lib/pkgconfig\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Install Python 3.6.13 with `pyenv`:**\n\n   Use `pyenv` to install Python 3.6.13 with OpenSSL support:\n   ```bash\n   env PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS=\"--enable-framework\" \\\n   CFLAGS=\"-I$(brew --prefix openssl@1.1)/include\" \\\n   LDFLAGS=\"-L$(brew --prefix openssl@1.1)/lib\" \\\n   pyenv install 3.6.13\n   ```\n\n5. **Use Python 3.6.13:**\n\n   After the installation completes, set Python 3.6.13 as the local version for your project:\n   ```bash\n   pyenv local 3.6.13\n   ```\n\n### Workaround with Docker:\n\nIf you continue to experience issues, another workaround is to use Docker to run your application in a container with Python 3.6.13. This way, you avoid compatibility issues with macOS entirely.\n\n1. **Install Docker:**\n\n   Download and install Docker Desktop for Mac from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).\n\n2. **Create a Dockerfile:**\n\n   Create a `Dockerfile` with the following content:\n   ```dockerfile\n   FROM python:3.6.13-slim\n\n   WORKDIR /app\n\n   COPY . .\n\n   RUN pip install conda\n   RUN conda install -c deezer-research spleeter\n\n   CMD [\"python\", \"your_script.py\"]\n   ```\n\n3. **Build and Run the Docker Container:**\n\n   Build the Docker image and run the container:\n   ```bash\n   docker build -t my-python-app .\n   docker run -it --rm my-python-app\n   ```\n\nBy using the above steps, you should be able to either resolve the installation issue on your macOS Big Sur system or use Docker as an alternative to run Python 3.6.13."
