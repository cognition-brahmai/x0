However, instead of executing the Python script, it just displays the code as HTML in my browser. Can you help me understand where I went wrong and how I can successfully run a Python file in a web page?"

        "content": "To run a Python script on a web page, you need to understand that web servers do not directly execute Python scripts in the way that they execute PHP scripts, for example. Instead, you need a web server that can interpret Python scripts, such as using a web framework or gateway interface. Here's one way to do it using the CGI (Common Gateway Interface) method, which is a standard way to execute scripts via a web server:\n\n1. **Set Up a Web Server:**\n   Make sure you have a web server installed that supports CGI. Common choices are Apache or Nginx. For simplicity, you can use the built-in HTTP server module in Python for testing purposes, but note that this is not suitable for production use.\n\n2. **Configure CGI:**\n   If you're using Apache, you need to enable CGI. This can be done by making sure the `mod_cgi` module is enabled and configuring the server to recognize `.py` files as CGI scripts.\n\n3. **Create a CGI Script:**\n   Convert your Python script to a CGI script. CGI scripts need to include HTTP headers to tell the browser what kind of content to expect. Here's how you can modify your script:\n\n   ```python\n   #!/usr/bin/env python\n\n   print(\"Content-type: text/html\\n\")  # This is the content-type header\n   print(\"Hi Welcome to Python test page<br>\")\n   print(\"Now it will show a calculation<br>\")\n   print(\"30+2=\")\n   print(30+2)\n   ```\n\n   Note that you need to include the `#!/usr/bin/env python` shebang line at the top of your script to specify the path to the Python interpreter.\n\n4. **Change Script Permissions:**\n   Ensure your script has the correct permissions. It should be executable. You can do this by running `chmod +x index.py` from your terminal.\n\n5. **Run the Web Server:**\n   If you're using Python's built-in server for testing, you can start it with CGI support like this:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m http.server --cgi 8000\n   ```\n\n   Then, place your script in a directory named `cgi-bin` (or configure your server to recognize another directory as a CGI directory) and access it via `http://localhost:8000/cgi-bin/index.py`.\n\n6. **Access the Script:**\n   Open your web browser and navigate to the URL where your script is hosted, such as `http://localhost:8000/cgi-bin/index.py`.\n\nBy following these steps, your Python script should execute on the server and return the output to your web browser. Remember that CGI is a simple but somewhat outdated method for running server-side scripts, and for more complex or modern web applications, you might want to explore frameworks like Flask or Django."
