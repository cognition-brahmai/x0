For example, when I run the following code, it prints 1 and not +1. \n\n```python\nscore = +1\nprint(score) \n# output: 1\n```\nI am aware that negative values like -1 print with the minus sign. But, how can I achieve this for positive values without manually adding the plus sign?"

        "content": "In Python, the default behavior is to print positive numbers without a leading plus sign. To explicitly include a plus sign for positive numbers, you can use formatted string literals (also known as f-strings) or the `format()` method to specify the desired format.\n\nHere's how you can achieve it using f-strings:\n\n```python\nscore = +1\nprint(f\"{score:+}\")\n```\n\nAnd here's how you can do it using the `format()` method:\n\n```python\nscore = +1\nprint(\"{:+}\".format(score))\n```\n\nBoth of these methods will print `+1` for a positive score and include the plus sign. The `+` in the format specification tells Python to include a sign for both positive and negative numbers."
