The demand for robots is represented by the equation p = 10 - 0.05q, where p is the price in dollars and q is the quantity demanded. The demand for cars is represented by the equation p = 15 - 0.1q.\nWhat is the equilibrium price and quantity for each toy? How would a decrease in the cost of production affect the equilibrium price and quantity for each toy? Show your calculations and explain the concept behind the changes in equilibrium."

        "content": "To find the equilibrium price and quantity for each toy, we need to set the demand equal to the supply. However, since we don't have a specific supply equation, let's assume the factory operates at full capacity, meaning it produces 50 robots and 100 cars per day.\n\n### Robots\n\n**Demand Equation:**  \n\\[ p = 10 - 0.05q \\]  \n\nAt equilibrium, the quantity supplied (q) equals the quantity demanded. Since the factory produces 50 robots per day, let's set \\( q = 50 \\):\n\n\\[ p = 10 - 0.05 \\times 50 \\]  \n\\[ p = 10 - 2.5 \\]  \n\\[ p = 7.5 \\]\n\n**Equilibrium for Robots:**  \n- Quantity: 50 robots  \n- Price: $7.5\n\n### Cars\n\n**Demand Equation:**  \n\\[ p = 15 - 0.1q \\]  \n\nAt equilibrium, the quantity supplied (q) equals the quantity demanded. Since the factory produces 100 cars per day, let's set \\( q = 100 \\):\n\n\\[ p = 15 - 0.1 \\times 100 \\]  \n\\[ p = 15 - 10 \\]  \n\\[ p = 5 \\]\n\n**Equilibrium for Cars:**  \n- Quantity: 100 cars  \n- Price: $5\n\n### Effect of a Decrease in the Cost of Production\n\nA decrease in the cost of production typically affects the supply side of the market. If production becomes cheaper, the factory might be able to increase its supply at the same price, or maintain the same supply at a lower price.\n\n1. **Increase in Supply:**\n   - If the factory increases production, the supply curve shifts to the right. This results in a lower equilibrium price and a higher equilibrium quantity, assuming demand remains unchanged.\n   \n2. **Reduction in Price:**\n   - If the factory keeps the same production level but reduces prices due to lower costs, this can lead to a movement along the demand curve, leading to a higher quantity demanded at the new lower price.\n\n**Conceptual Explanation:**\n\n- **Equilibrium** is found where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. In a simplified model with fixed production, the equilibrium quantity is the production capacity.\n- A **decrease in production cost** typically makes it cheaper to produce additional units, which usually increases supply. This shift in supply generally leads to a lower price and a higher quantity in the market.\n- **Supply and Demand Curves:** The equilibrium is the intersection of supply and demand curves. A shift in the supply curve (due to decreased costs) results in a new intersection point with the demand curve, signifying a new equilibrium.\n\nWithout specific supply equations, exact numerical changes in equilibrium price and quantity can't be precisely calculated but can be understood conceptually as outlined above."
