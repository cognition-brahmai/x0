Even when I try to set the size to (100, 100), the window size does not change. If I set the size_hint to (None, None), the button is correctly sized but the window is still large. How can I create a window that is the same size as the button?\n\n```python\nimport kivy\nkivy.require('1.5.1')\n\nfrom kivy.app import App\nfrom kivy.uix.button import Button\n\nclass MyApp(App):\n    def build(self): return Button(text='Some text')\n\nMyApp().run()\n```"

        "content": "In Kivy, the window size is not determined directly by the widget sizes but rather by the window configuration or the root widget's size. By default, Kivy creates a window that is 800x600 pixels if not otherwise specified. To set the window size to match the button size, you can configure the window size manually when you initialize your application.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to make the window the same size as the button:\n\n```python\nimport kivy\nkivy.require('1.5.1')\n\nfrom kivy.app import App\nfrom kivy.uix.button import Button\nfrom kivy.core.window import Window\n\nclass MyApp(App):\n    def build(self):\n        # Create a button with a specific size\n        button = Button(text='Some text', size_hint=(None, None), size=(100, 100))\n        \n        # Set the window size to match the button size\n        Window.size = (100, 100)\n        \n        return button\n\nMyApp().run()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Window Size**: You can control the window size using `Window.size`. This should be set before returning the root widget in your `build` method.\n2. **Button Size**: Using `size_hint=(None, None)` allows you to set fixed size dimensions for the button. When `size_hint` is disabled (by setting it to `None`), you can specify the button's exact size via the `size` attribute.\n3. **Layout Considerations**: If you later decide to use a layout (like a `BoxLayout` or `GridLayout`), the layout may influence the sizing behavior. In such cases, make sure to configure the layout and its children properly to achieve the desired window size.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that the window size matches your button size as intended."
