I like the ability to run a single test straight from VSCode, but I'd prefer not to have to click a button each time and rather use a shortcut."

        "content": "Yes, you can assign a shortcut in Visual Studio Code to run the current test method or test class using the Python extension and a few custom configurations. Here's how you can set it up:\n\n1. **Ensure You Have the Python Extension Installed**: Make sure you have the Python extension installed in Visual Studio Code.\n\n2. **Install the `pytest` Testing Framework**: Ensure that you have `pytest` installed in your Python environment, as VSCode's Python extension uses `pytest` for running tests. You can install it using pip:\n\n   ```\n   pip install pytest\n   ```\n\n3. **Configure the Testing Framework in VSCode**:\n   - Open your workspace or project in VSCode.\n   - Go to the settings (you can press `Ctrl + ,` to open settings).\n   - Search for `Python Testing` and enable testing by setting the `python.testing.pytestEnabled` option to `true`.\n\n4. **Create Tasks for Running Tests**:\n   - Open the command palette using `Ctrl + Shift + P`.\n   - Type `Tasks: Configure Task` and select it.\n   - Choose `Create tasks.json file from template` and select `Others`.\n   - This will open a `tasks.json` file. Add a new task configuration for running a test under the cursor:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\n     \"tasks\": [\n       {\n         \"label\": \"Run Test at Cursor\",\n         \"type\": \"shell\",\n         \"command\": \"pytest\",\n         \"args\": [\n           \"${file}\",\n           \"-k\",\n           \"${selectedText}\"\n         ],\n         \"presentation\": {\n           \"echo\": true,\n           \"reveal\": \"always\",\n           \"focus\": false,\n           \"panel\": \"shared\"\n         },\n         \"problemMatcher\": []\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n   This configuration assumes that you will select the test method or class name before running the task.\n\n5. **Create a Keyboard Shortcut**:\n   - Open the command palette again (`Ctrl + Shift + P`) and type `Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)`.\n   - Add a new keybinding for the task you created:\n\n   ```json\n   [\n     {\n       \"key\": \"ctrl+alt+t\", // You can change this to any shortcut you like\n       \"command\": \"workbench.action.tasks.runTask\",\n       \"args\": \"Run Test at Cursor\"\n     }\n   ]\n   ```\n\n6. **Running Tests**:\n   - Place your cursor on the test method or class, or select the test name.\n   - Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` (or your chosen shortcut) to run the test.\n\nThis setup allows you to run the test under the cursor using a keyboard shortcut. You might need to adjust the task configuration depending on your specific setup or preferences."
