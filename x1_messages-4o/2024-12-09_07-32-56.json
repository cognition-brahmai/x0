Here are a couple of methods to do this:\n\n### Method 1: Using pip\n\nOpen your command prompt or terminal and type the following command:\n\n```bash\npip list\n```\n\nThis command will display a list of all the installed Python packages along with their versions.\n\n### Method 2: Using Python\n\nYou can also generate a list of installed packages from within a Python script or the interactive Python shell:\n\n```python\nimport pkg_resources\n\ninstalled_packages = pkg_resources.working_set\ninstalled_packages_list = sorted([f\"{i.key}=={i.version}\" for i in installed_packages])\nfor pkg in installed_packages_list:\n    print(pkg)\n```\n\nThis script uses `pkg_resources` to retrieve and print the list of installed packages with their versions.\n\n### Method 3: Using `pip freeze`\n\nThis method is similar to `pip list`, but it formats the output in a way that is suitable for storing in a `requirements.txt` file:\n\n```bash\npip freeze\n```\n\nThe output will list all installed packages and their versions, typically used for dependency management.\n\nChoose the method that best fits your needs. If you're managing dependencies for a project, you might find `pip freeze` particularly useful for creating a `requirements.txt` file."
