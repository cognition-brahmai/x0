You cannot use the built-in PriorityQueue class or any built-in sorting functions. Instead, create your own priority queue using a linked list or an array, and implement a custom sorting algorithm that takes into account the urgency level of each task. Don't forget to include an additional field for urgency level in the Task class. Good luck!"

        "content": "To implement a priority queue in Java without using the built-in `PriorityQueue` class or sorting functions, you can create a custom priority queue using a linked list or an array. Below, I'll show you how to implement this using a linked list. We'll define a `Task` class that includes both priority and urgency level, and a `PriorityQueue` class that sorts tasks based on these fields.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Task Class\n\nFirst, let's create the `Task` class, which includes fields for the task description, priority, and urgency level.\n\n```java\nclass Task {\n    String description;\n    int priority;\n    int urgency;\n\n    public Task(String description, int priority, int urgency) {\n        this.description = description;\n        this.priority = priority;\n        this.urgency = urgency;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return \"Task{\" +\n                \"description='\" + description + '\\'' +\n                \", priority=\" + priority +\n                \", urgency=\" + urgency +\n                '}';\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Implement the Custom Priority Queue\n\nNext, we'll create a custom priority queue using a linked list. The tasks will be sorted based on priority and urgency, with higher priority and urgency tasks appearing first.\n\n```java\nclass CustomPriorityQueue {\n    private class Node {\n        Task task;\n        Node next;\n\n        Node(Task task) {\n            this.task = task;\n            this.next = null;\n        }\n    }\n\n    private Node head;\n\n    public CustomPriorityQueue() {\n        this.head = null;\n    }\n\n    // Method to insert a task into the priority queue\n    public void insert(Task task) {\n        Node newNode = new Node(task);\n\n        if (head == null || compare(task, head.task) > 0) {\n            newNode.next = head;\n            head = newNode;\n        } else {\n            Node current = head;\n            while (current.next != null && compare(task, current.next.task) <= 0) {\n                current = current.next;\n            }\n            newNode.next = current.next;\n            current.next = newNode;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Method to remove and return the highest priority task\n    public Task remove() {\n        if (head == null) {\n            return null;\n        }\n        Task highestPriorityTask = head.task;\n        head = head.next;\n        return highestPriorityTask;\n    }\n\n    // Method to compare tasks based on priority and urgency\n    private int compare(Task t1, Task t2) {\n        if (t1.priority != t2.priority) {\n            return Integer.compare(t2.priority, t1.priority);\n        }\n        return Integer.compare(t2.urgency, t1.urgency);\n    }\n\n    // Method to check if the queue is empty\n    public boolean isEmpty() {\n        return head == null;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Usage Example\n\nHere's how you can use the `CustomPriorityQueue` to manage a list of tasks:\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        CustomPriorityQueue queue = new CustomPriorityQueue();\n        \n        queue.insert(new Task(\"Task 1\", 2, 5));\n        queue.insert(new Task(\"Task 2\", 3, 4));\n        queue.insert(new Task(\"Task 3\", 1, 6));\n        queue.insert(new Task(\"Task 4\", 2, 7));\n\n        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {\n            System.out.println(queue.remove());\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Task Class**: Represents a task with a description, priority, and urgency level.\n- **CustomPriorityQueue**: Uses a linked list to maintain the tasks in sorted order. The `insert` method places tasks in the correct position based on their priority and urgency.\n- **compare Method**: Compares two tasks. It first compares priorities and, if they are equal, compares urgency.\n- **remove Method**: Removes and returns the task with the highest priority and urgency.\n- **Main Class**: Demonstrates how to use the custom priority queue.\n\nThis implementation sorts tasks based on priority and urgency without using Java's built-in sorting functions."
