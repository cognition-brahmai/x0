I want to understand which attributes the trees are splitting on at each level, as well as their associated information values. This will help me understand where the two criterion make different choices. I have looked into the 9 methods outlined in the documentation, but haven't been able to find this information. Is there a way to access this data, perhaps through a list or dict that has entries for node and gain?"

        "content": "Certainly! In scikit-learn, you can access the details of a trained decision tree, including the features it splits on and the impurity values at each node. Although scikit-learn does not provide a direct method to extract this information in a structured list or dictionary, you can gather the necessary information by accessing the attributes of the `DecisionTreeClassifier` or `DecisionTreeRegressor` object.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Fit your decision tree** using either the `DecisionTreeClassifier` or `DecisionTreeRegressor`, specifying `criterion='entropy'` or `criterion='gini'`.\n\n2. **Access the tree structure** through the `tree_` attribute of the fitted model. This attribute provides access to several internal properties.\n\n3. **Extract the splitting information** by iterating over the nodes.\n\nHere's a sample code snippet to help you extract the information:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load sample data\ndata = load_iris()\nX, y = data.data, data.target\n\n# Fit the decision tree\nclf = DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion='entropy')\nclf.fit(X, y)\n\n# Access the attributes of the tree\ntree = clf.tree_\n\n# Extract information about splits\nfeature = tree.feature\nthreshold = tree.threshold\nimpurity = tree.impurity\nn_node_samples = tree.n_node_samples\n\ndef print_tree_info(node, depth=0):\n    indent = \"  \" * depth\n    if tree.children_left[node] == tree.children_right[node]:\n        # It's a leaf node\n        print(f\"{indent}Leaf node: Impurity = {impurity[node]:.4f}, Samples = {n_node_samples[node]}\")\n    else:\n        # It's an internal node\n        feature_idx = feature[node]\n        print(f\"{indent}Node: Feature = {data.feature_names[feature_idx]}, Threshold = {threshold[node]:.4f}, Impurity = {impurity[node]:.4f}, Samples = {n_node_samples[node]}\")\n        # Recurse for the left and right children\n        print_tree_info(tree.children_left[node], depth + 1)\n        print_tree_info(tree.children_right[node], depth + 1)\n\n# Print the tree structure and splitting information\nprint_tree_info(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **feature**: An array where each entry provides the index of the feature used for splitting at each node.\n- **threshold**: Threshold values for the features used for splitting.\n- **impurity**: Impurity value (entropy or gini) at each node.\n- **n_node_samples**: Number of samples at each node.\n\nBy using this approach, you can examine the decisions made by the tree at each node and compare how the entropy and gini criteria affect the splits. This will help you understand the differences in decision-making between the two criteria."
