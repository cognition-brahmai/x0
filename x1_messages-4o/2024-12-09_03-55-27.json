        "content": "Generating a Markdown version of your Sphinx-based documentation from reStructuredText (reST) sources isn't directly supported by Sphinx, as its primary focus is on generating HTML and other formats like LaTeX, ePub, and PDF. However, you can achieve this by using a few different approaches:\n\n1. **Pandoc**: Although you've mentioned wanting to avoid manually using Pandoc, it remains one of the most straightforward ways to convert reST to Markdown. You can script the conversion process to automate it across multiple files.\n\n2. **Sphinx Extensions**: While there isn't a built-in Sphinx extension specifically for converting to Markdown, you can consider using or creating a custom Sphinx extension. One approach is to use the `sphinx-markdown-builder` extension, which allows you to output Markdown files. It might require some setup and configuration, but it provides a more integrated solution.\n\n   To use `sphinx-markdown-builder`, you can follow these steps:\n\n   - Install the extension via pip:\n     ```\n     pip install sphinx-markdown-builder\n     ```\n\n   - Add `'sphinx_markdown_builder'` to your `extensions` list in `conf.py`:\n     ```python\n     extensions = [\n         ...,\n         'sphinx_markdown_builder',\n     ]\n     ```\n\n   - Build your documentation with the Markdown builder:\n     ```\n     sphinx-build -b markdown [source-dir] [output-dir]\n     ```\n     \n   This extension will convert your reST files into Markdown format, which you can then use as needed.\n\n3. **Custom Script**: If the above solutions don't meet your requirements, you might consider writing a custom script to convert your reST files to Markdown. You can use Python libraries like `docutils` to parse reST files and convert them into Markdown format programmatically.\n\nEach of these approaches has its pros and cons, but using an existing extension like `sphinx-markdown-builder` is likely the most straightforward way to integrate into your Sphinx workflow."
