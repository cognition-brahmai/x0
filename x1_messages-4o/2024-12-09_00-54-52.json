On the other hand, \"\\d+\\.\\d+\" would only match the value with the decimal and would return no matches found for \"3593\". I would like to get \"3434.35353\" or \"3593\" when I call m.group(1)."

        "content": "To match both integers and floating-point numbers using a single regular expression in Python, you can use the following pattern:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\npattern = r'^\\d+(\\.\\d+)?$'\n\n# Test strings\ntest_strings = [\"3434.35353\", \"3593\"]\n\nfor test_string in test_strings:\n    match = re.match(pattern, test_string)\n    if match:\n        print(f\"Match found: {test_string}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"No match found for: {test_string}\")\n```\n\nExplanation of the regular expression `^\\d+(\\.\\d+)?$`:\n\n- `^` asserts the start of the string.\n- `\\d+` matches one or more digits.\n- `(\\.\\d+)?` is an optional group that matches a decimal point followed by one or more digits. The `?` makes this group optional, allowing the pattern to match numbers without a decimal point as well.\n- `$` asserts the end of the string.\n\nThis pattern will match both whole numbers and numbers with decimal points."
