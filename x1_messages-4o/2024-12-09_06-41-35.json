When I execute 'print sys.version', I get \"2.7.3 (default, Feb 26 2013, 16:27:39) [GCC 4.4.6 20120305 (Red Hat 4.4.6-4)]\". Moreover, on running 'ldd /usr/local/bin/python', I get a list of libraries, but I don't understand which Python version I have? Also, why is my Python script failing to run from the terminal? I have tried to run 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/' but it did not work. Interestingly, I have been able to debug this script in Eclipse with the Python plug-in, and when I look at the debug configuration, I see that the PYTHONPATH is set for a specific path. How can I run my script without Eclipse and from the command line? What am I doing wrong? I am using CentOS6."

        "content": "The error you're encountering is likely due to a missing shared library that Python depends on. Let's go through a few steps to help resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Python Installation**:\n   - It's possible that your Python installation is not complete or that the `libpython2.7.so.1.0` library is not in the expected location.\n   - You can check if the library exists by running:\n     ```bash\n     find /usr -name \"libpython2.7.so.1.0\"\n     ```\n   - If it exists, take note of its location.\n\n2. **Set the Library Path**:\n   - If you found the library, make sure your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` includes the directory where it resides. For example:\n     ```bash\n     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/library:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n     ```\n   - You can add this line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` to make it persistent.\n\n3. **Reinstall Python**:\n   - If the library doesn't exist, you might need to reinstall Python. You can use `yum` to reinstall or update your Python installation:\n     ```bash\n     sudo yum install python27\n     ```\n\n4. **Check PYTHONPATH**:\n   - Ensure that your `PYTHONPATH` is correctly set if your script relies on specific modules or packages.\n   - You can set it temporarily in the terminal like this:\n     ```bash\n     export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/your/modules\n     ```\n\n5. **Use Virtual Environments**:\n   - Consider using a Python virtual environment. This can help manage dependencies and libraries specific to your projects without interfering with the system Python.\n   - Create a virtual environment:\n     ```bash\n     python2.7 -m venv myenv\n     ```\n   - Activate it:\n     ```bash\n     source myenv/bin/activate\n     ```\n   - Install necessary packages inside your virtual environment and run your script.\n\n6. **Check Python Binary**:\n   - Ensure that you are using the correct Python binary. If you have multiple versions installed, specify the full path to the Python interpreter you want to use:\n     ```bash\n     /usr/local/bin/python your_script.py\n     ```\n\n7. **Debugging**:\n   - If you can run the script from Eclipse, check the exact command Eclipse uses to execute the script and replicate it in the terminal.\n   - Sometimes IDEs configure additional environment variables that might be missing when running from the terminal.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully run your Python script from the terminal."
