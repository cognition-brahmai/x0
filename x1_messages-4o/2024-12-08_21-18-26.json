Here's a sample code that demonstrates how to achieve this:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\twords := []string{\"Sky\", \"High\", \"love\", \"grows\", \"Sun\", \"sets\", \"my\", \"for\", \"you\"}\n\n\tif len(words) < 9 {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"The list of words is too short to create the desired poetry form.\")\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\t// First line: one word\n\tfirstLine := words[0]\n\n\t// Second line: three words\n\tsecondLine := words[1:4]\n\n\t// Third line: five words\n\tthirdLine := words[4:9]\n\n\tfmt.Println(\"Traditional Japanese Poetry Form:\")\n\tfmt.Println(firstLine)\n\tfmt.Println(secondLine[0], secondLine[1], secondLine[2])\n\tfmt.Println(thirdLine[0], thirdLine[1], thirdLine[2], thirdLine[3], thirdLine[4])\n}\n```\n\nThis code checks if there are enough words in the list to create the desired poetry form and then arranges them accordingly. The output will be:\n\n```\nTraditional Japanese Poetry Form:\nSky\nHigh love grows\nSun sets my for you\n```\n\nYou can adjust the list of words or the selection logic to create variations of the poetry."
