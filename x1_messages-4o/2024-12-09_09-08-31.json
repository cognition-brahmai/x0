To detect if there is any overlap between two given ranges, you can define a function that takes the start and end points of both ranges as input and checks for any intersection. Here's a simple Python function to do that:\n\n```python\ndef ranges_overlap(range1_start, range1_end, range2_start, range2_end):\n    # Check if one range starts after the other one ends\n    if range1_end < range2_start or range2_end < range1_start:\n        return False\n    else:\n        return True\n\n# Example usage:\nrange1_start = 1\nrange1_end = 5\nrange2_start = 4\nrange2_end = 8\n\noverlap = ranges_overlap(range1_start, range1_end, range2_start, range2_end)\nprint(\"Do the ranges overlap?\", overlap)\n```\n\nIn this function, `ranges_overlap`, it checks if one range starts after the other ends. If neither range is completely after the other, then they overlap. The function returns `True` if there is an overlap and `False` otherwise."
