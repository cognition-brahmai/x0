Is it possible to create a date object without specifying the day? I am using the date object as a key in my dictionary and I need January 20 to have the same key as January 21, because they are in the same month and year. Before this, I used a simple integer as a month number, but now I need to know the year too. Here's the error I get when I try to create a date object without the day:\n\n<pre><code>In [5]: from datetime import date\nIn [6]: date(year=2013, month=1)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\n&lt;ipython-input-6-a84d4034b10c&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()\n----&gt; 1 date(year=2013, month=1)\nTypeError: Required argument 'day' (pos 3) not found\n</code></pre>"

        "content": "In Python, the `date` object from the `datetime` module indeed requires a day argument, as it represents a specific day. However, for your use case\u2014where you want to use only the year and month as a key in your dictionary\u2014you can consider using a tuple or a custom object to represent the year and month. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n### Using a Tuple\nYou can create a tuple with the year and month, which can then be used as a dictionary key:\n\n```python\n# Using a tuple as a key\ndate_key = (2013, 1)\n\n# Example dictionary\ndate_dict = {}\ndate_dict[date_key] = \"Some value\"\n\n# Accessing the value\nprint(date_dict[(2013, 1)])  # Output: Some value\n```\n\n### Using a Custom Class\nIf you prefer a more structured approach, you can create a custom class to represent the year and month:\n\n```python\nclass YearMonth:\n    def __init__(self, year, month):\n        self.year = year\n        self.month = month\n    \n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        return (self.year, self.month) == (other.year, other.month)\n    \n    def __hash__(self):\n        return hash((self.year, self.month))\n\n# Using the custom class as a key\ndate_key = YearMonth(2013, 1)\n\n# Example dictionary\ndate_dict = {}\ndate_dict[date_key] = \"Some value\"\n\n# Accessing the value\nprint(date_dict[YearMonth(2013, 1)])  # Output: Some value\n```\n\nBoth methods allow you to use a combination of year and month as a unique key in your dictionary without needing to specify a day."
