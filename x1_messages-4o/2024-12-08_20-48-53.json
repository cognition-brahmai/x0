And is there a way to search for primary sources, such as interviews or data sets, that may be relevant to my investigation?\n[Formula]:\nTo filter articles and reports within the last 5 years, use the formula: \npublication_date >= (current_date - interval '5' year) \nTo search for primary sources, try incorporating keywords such as \"interviews\" or \"data sets\" in your search query, and look for sources from reputable organizations or individuals in the field."

Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you:\n\n### Filtering Articles and Reports:\n\n1. **Database Filters:**\n   - **Academic Databases:** Use platforms like Google Scholar, JSTOR, or PubMed. These often have built-in filters to limit search results by publication date. Look for options to set a custom date range or select the last 5 years.\n   - **Library Catalogs:** Many university libraries provide access to digital catalogs with similar filtering options.\n\n2. **Search Engines:**\n   - If you're using search engines like Google, use the \"Tools\" option below the search bar to filter results by time.\n\n3. **SQL-like Filtering:**\n   - If you're accessing a database that supports SQL queries, you can use the formula you mentioned:\n     ```\n     WHERE publication_date >= (CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '5' YEAR)\n     ```\n   - Adjust the syntax based on the database language if necessary.\n\n### Searching for Primary Sources:\n\n1. **Keywords:**\n   - Use specific keywords in your search queries such as \"interviews,\" \"data sets,\" \"survey results,\" \"field study,\" or \"original research.\" Combine these with topic-specific terms to narrow down results.\n\n2. **Repositories and Archives:**\n   - Explore repositories such as Dryad, Figshare, or government open data portals where researchers often share data sets.\n   - Institutional repositories often have collections of primary research data.\n\n3. **Digital Libraries and Archives:**\n   - Platforms like the Library of Congress, British Library, or national archives often have digital collections of primary sources.\n\n4. **Academic Journals:**\n   - Some journals are dedicated to publishing primary data and research findings. Look for sections within journals labeled as \"original research.\"\n\n5. **Professional Organizations:**\n   - Many professional organizations publish interviews or data sets relevant to their field of expertise. Check their websites or publications.\n\n6. **Contact Authors or Researchers:**\n   - If you find studies or papers that reference primary data, consider reaching out directly to the authors for access to their primary data.\n\nBy combining these strategies, you should be able to efficiently locate and filter the scholarly articles, government reports, and primary sources relevant to your investigation."
