        "content": "To accomplish the tasks you've outlined, let's break it down step-by-step using Python, a versatile programming language well-suited for data analysis and visualization:\n\n### Calculating Total Revenue\n\n1. **Formula for Total Revenue**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Revenue} = (\\text{Product Price} - \\text{Discount}) \\times \\text{Quantity Purchased}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Python Implementation**:\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n\n   # Sample data\n   data = [\n       {'product': 'Product A', 'price': 100, 'discount': 10, 'quantity': 5},\n       {'product': 'Product B', 'price': 150, 'discount': 20, 'quantity': 3}\n   ]\n\n   df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n   df['total_revenue'] = (df['price'] - df['discount']) * df['quantity']\n   print(df[['product', 'total_revenue']])\n   ```\n\n### Creating a Funnel Diagram\n\n1. **Funnel Diagram Percentages**:\n   - Add to Cart %: \\(\\frac{\\text{Number of Customers who Added to Cart}}{\\text{Total Customers}} \\times 100\\)\n   - Proceed to Checkout %: \\(\\frac{\\text{Number of Customers who Proceeded to Checkout}}{\\text{Total Customers}} \\times 100\\)\n   - Complete Transaction %: \\(\\frac{\\text{Number of Customers who Completed Transaction}}{\\text{Total Customers}} \\times 100\\)\n\n2. **Python Visualization**:\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n   # Sample funnel data\n   funnel_data = {\n       'stage': ['Add to Cart', 'Proceed to Checkout', 'Complete Transaction'],\n       'customers': [80, 50, 30]\n   }\n\n   df_funnel = pd.DataFrame(funnel_data)\n   df_funnel['percentage'] = (df_funnel['customers'] / df_funnel['customers'].iloc[0]) * 100\n\n   # Plotting the funnel\n   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\n   plt.bar(df_funnel['stage'], df_funnel['percentage'], color=['blue', 'orange', 'green'])\n   plt.title('Customer Purchase Funnel')\n   plt.xlabel('Stage')\n   plt.ylabel('Percentage (%)')\n   plt.show()\n   ```\n\n### Exporting the Visualization\n\n1. **Export Functionality**:\n   - Use Matplotlib's `savefig` function to save the visualization.\n\n2. **Export as Image or PDF**:\n   ```python\n   # Save as an image\n   plt.savefig('customer_funnel.png')\n\n   # Save as a PDF\n   plt.savefig('customer_funnel.pdf')\n   ```\n\n### Summary:\n- **Programming Language**: Python\n- **Libraries Used**: `pandas` for data manipulation, `matplotlib` for visualization\n- **Export Methods**: `savefig` from Matplotlib to export as PNG or PDF\n\nThis approach will allow you to calculate total revenue for each product, visualize the customer journey in a funnel diagram, and export your visualization to share with your team."
