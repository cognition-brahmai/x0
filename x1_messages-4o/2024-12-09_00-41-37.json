        "content": "To establish a connection between Python and Db2, you can use the `ibm_db` library, which provides a Python interface for IBM Db2 databases. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you set it up:\n\n### Step 1: Install the `ibm_db` Package\n\nFirst, you need to install the `ibm_db` package. You can do this using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install ibm_db\n```\n\n### Step 2: Import the Package\n\nIn your Python script, import the `ibm_db` package:\n\n```python\nimport ibm_db\n```\n\n### Step 3: Prepare the Connection Details\n\nYou'll need the following details to connect to your Db2 database:\n\n- **Database Name**\n- **Host Name or IP Address**\n- **Port Number**\n- **User ID**\n- **Password**\n\nYou can either directly specify these details in your connection string or store them in a configuration file for security purposes.\n\n### Step 4: Create a Connection\n\nUse the connection details to establish a connection to the Db2 database. Here is an example:\n\n```python\n# Replace the following placeholder values with your actual Db2 details\ndsn_hostname = \"YOUR_HOSTNAME\"\ndsn_port = \"YOUR_PORT\"\ndsn_database = \"YOUR_DATABASE\"\ndsn_uid = \"YOUR_USERID\"\ndsn_pwd = \"YOUR_PASSWORD\"\n\n# Create the connection string\ndsn = (\n    \"DATABASE={0};\"\n    \"HOSTNAME={1};\"\n    \"PORT={2};\"\n    \"PROTOCOL=TCPIP;\"\n    \"UID={3};\"\n    \"PWD={4};\"\n).format(dsn_database, dsn_hostname, dsn_port, dsn_uid, dsn_pwd)\n\ntry:\n    # Establish the connection\n    conn = ibm_db.connect(dsn, \"\", \"\")\n    print(\"Connected to Db2!\")\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(\"Unable to connect to Db2:\", e)\n\n```\n\n### Step 5: Perform Database Operations\n\nOnce connected, you can execute SQL queries using the connection object. Here\u2019s an example of how to execute a simple query:\n\n```python\n# Example query\nsql = \"SELECT * FROM your_table\"\n\ntry:\n    # Execute the query\n    stmt = ibm_db.exec_immediate(conn, sql)\n\n    # Fetch the results\n    result = ibm_db.fetch_assoc(stmt)\n    while result:\n        print(result)\n        result = ibm_db.fetch_assoc(stmt)\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(\"Failed to execute query:\", e)\n```\n\n### Step 6: Close the Connection\n\nAfter you finish your operations, it\u2019s important to close the connection:\n\n```python\nibm_db.close(conn)\n```\n\nThis is a basic setup to get you started with connecting Python to a Db2 database. Depending on your use case, you might need to handle exceptions, use connection pooling, or manage transactions more robustly."
