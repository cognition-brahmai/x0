I want to get a list that contains all the mapped elements that aren't None, but I don't want to call the `map_to_obj` method twice in the list comprehension for performance reasons. Here's an example of what I'm trying to achieve:\n\n```python\n# input a list, returns an object\ndef map_to_obj(lst):\n    a_list = f(lst)\n    return a_list[0] if a_list else None\n```\n\nI want to create a list like this:\n\n```python\nv_list = [v1, v2, v3, v4]\n\n[map_to_obj(v) for v in v_list if map_to_obj(v)]\n```\n\nBut I'm looking for a way to use local variables in list comprehensions to avoid calling `map_to_obj` twice. Does the compiler optimize this automatically, or is there a better way to do it?"

        "content": "In Python, list comprehensions do not inherently support the direct assignment of local variables within their syntax. However, you can use a workaround to avoid calling the `map_to_obj` method twice by using a helper function or a generator expression with an inner loop. Here\u2019s how you can achieve this:\n\n### Using a Helper Function\n\nYou can define a helper function inside your main function or script to handle the logic of calling `map_to_obj` and filtering out `None` values:\n\n```python\ndef map_to_obj(lst):\n    a_list = f(lst)\n    return a_list[0] if a_list else None\n\ndef filtered_mapped_list(v_list):\n    def helper(v):\n        obj = map_to_obj(v)\n        return obj if obj is not None else None\n    \n    return [obj for v in v_list if (obj := helper(v)) is not None]\n\nv_list = [v1, v2, v3, v4]\nresult = filtered_mapped_list(v_list)\n```\n\n### Using the Walrus Operator\n\nIf you are using Python 3.8 or later, you can make use of the walrus operator `:=` to assign a value to a variable within a list comprehension. This allows you to store the result of `map_to_obj(v)` and use it both for filtering and collecting non-`None` values:\n\n```python\ndef map_to_obj(lst):\n    a_list = f(lst)\n    return a_list[0] if a_list else None\n\nv_list = [v1, v2, v3, v4]\n\nresult = [obj for v in v_list if (obj := map_to_obj(v)) is not None]\n```\n\nHere, `(obj := map_to_obj(v))` assigns the result of `map_to_obj(v)` to `obj`, which is then used in the `if` condition to filter out `None` values. This approach is efficient and concise.\n\nBoth of these methods will help you avoid calling `map_to_obj` twice, thereby improving performance."
