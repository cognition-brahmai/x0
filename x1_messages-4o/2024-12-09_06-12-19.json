I am using binaries from this website: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#scikit-learn. I have downloaded the relevant package and tried to upgrade it, but both locally and from a remote site, I get the message 'Requirement already up-to-date'. Here are the commands I used:\n\n```\nC:\\Users\\skumar&gt;pip install --upgrade --use-wheel --no-index --find-links=../../\nSOURCE/APPS scikit-learn\nIgnoring indexes: https://pypi.python.org/simple\nRequirement already up-to-date: scikit-learn in c:\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\n```\n\nand\n\n```\nC:\\Users\\skumar&gt;pip install --upgrade --use-wheel --no-index --trusted-host www.\nlfd.uci.edu --find-links=http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ scikit-learn\nIgnoring indexes: https://pypi.python.org/simple\nRequirement already up-to-date: scikit-learn in c:\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\n```\n\nOn the remote site there are two versions, 0.16 and 0.17. Is there a way to specify a version in the command? Or how do you install/upgrade a wheel file?"

        "content": "To upgrade your scikit-learn package to a specific version using pip with wheel files, you can specify the version number directly in the pip command. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Download the specific version of the wheel file:**\n   Ensure you have downloaded the `.whl` file for scikit-learn version 0.17 that matches your Python version and architecture (e.g., `scikit_learn\u20110.17\u2011cp35\u2011cp35m\u2011win_amd64.whl` for Python 3.5 on a 64-bit Windows).\n\n2. **Install the specific version:**\n   Use the following command to install the specific version of the wheel file you downloaded:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade --no-index --find-links=path_to_directory scikit_learn-0.17-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl\n   ```\n\n   Replace `path_to_directory` with the actual path where your downloaded `.whl` file is located.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n- **Ensure pip is up-to-date:**\n  Sometimes having the latest version of pip can resolve installation issues. You can upgrade pip using:\n\n  ```bash\n  python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n  ```\n\n- **Verify your Python version and architecture:**\n  Make sure the wheel file you download matches your Python version and architecture. You can check your Python version and architecture using:\n\n  ```python\n  import platform\n  print(platform.python_version())\n  print(platform.architecture())\n  ```\n\n- **Install the package:**\n  If you have the correct wheel file, navigate to the directory where the wheel file is located using the command prompt and execute the installation command as mentioned above.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues, you may also try uninstalling the current version of scikit-learn and then installing the new version:\n\n```bash\npip uninstall scikit-learn\npip install --no-index --find-links=path_to_directory scikit_learn-0.17-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl\n```\n\nHopefully, this helps you upgrade your scikit-learn package successfully!"
