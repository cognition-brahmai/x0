Here's the Java code:\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int x = 10;\n        int y = 20;\n        int result = x + y;\n        System.out.println(\"The result is \" + result);\n    }\n}\n```"

        "content": "Certainly! Converting Java code to Kotlin is quite straightforward, especially for simple programs like the one you've provided. Here's how your Java code would look in Kotlin:\n\n```kotlin\nfun main() {\n    val x = 10\n    val y = 20\n    val result = x + y\n    println(\"The result is $result\")\n}\n```\n\n### Key Differences Explained:\n\n1. **Function Declaration**: Kotlin uses the `fun` keyword for declaring functions. The `main` function is the entry point of the application, similar to Java.\n\n2. **Variable Declaration**: \n   - `val` is used for read-only variables (similar to `final` in Java). \n   - If you need a mutable variable, you would use `var`.\n\n3. **String Interpolation**: Kotlin supports string interpolation using the `$` symbol, which makes it easier to embed variables within strings.\n\n4. **No Semicolons**: Kotlin does not require semicolons at the end of statements.\n\nThis conversion is quite direct, and Kotlin's syntax is designed to be more concise and readable compared to Java. If you have any more complex Java code or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
