While running the command 'python manage.py syncdb', I am encountering the error 'django.db.utils.IntegrityError: duplicate key value violates unique constraint \"django_content_type_pkey\"'. I have also installed 'south' and ran 'python manage.py schemamigration --initial contact_enquiries' which worked fine without any issues. But, when I ran 'python manage.py migrate contact_enquiries', I received the same error again. There aren't any syntax issues in my models, which is quite confusing. Here are my models:\n\n```\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass DocumentUpload(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=\"200\")\n\n    document_upload = models.FileField(upload_to=\"uploads/documents\")\n\n\n    def __unicode__(self):\n        return \"%s\" % self.name\n\nclass DocumentRequest(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=\"200\")\n\n    company = models.CharField(max_length=\"200\")\n\n    job_title = models.CharField(max_length=\"200\")\n\n    email = models.EmailField(max_length=\"200\")\n\n    report = models.ManyToManyField(DocumentUpload)\n\n    def __unicode__(self):\n        return \"%s\" % self.name\n```\nCan you help me understand and resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, `django.db.utils.IntegrityError: duplicate key value violates unique constraint \"django_content_type_pkey\"`, suggests that there is an issue with the `django_content_type` table, which is used by Django's content types framework to track all of the models installed in your application. This error usually indicates that there might be a duplicate entry or some inconsistency in this table.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check for Duplicates:**\n   - Directly inspect the `django_content_type` table in your Postgres database to see if there are any duplicate entries or inconsistencies.\n   - You can use a SQL client or a tool like `psql` to run a query such as:\n     ```sql\n     SELECT * FROM django_content_type ORDER BY id;\n     ```\n   - Look for duplicate entries or entries that might cause conflicts.\n\n2. **Clear and Rebuild the Content Types:**\n   - If you do find duplicates, you may need to clear the problematic entries and let Django rebuild them. Before doing this, ensure you have a backup of your database.\n   - You can try clearing the `django_content_type` table and then running `syncdb` again. Use:\n     ```sql\n     DELETE FROM django_content_type WHERE id IN (<list_of_duplicate_ids>);\n     ```\n   - After clearing, run:\n     ```bash\n     python manage.py syncdb\n     ```\n   - Be cautious with this approach as it might affect data integrity for existing records that rely on content types.\n\n3. **Check South Migrations:**\n   - Since you're using South for migrations, ensure that all migrations are in sync and correctly applied.\n   - You might have to fake initial migrations if the state is out of sync. Use:\n     ```bash\n     python manage.py migrate <app_name> --fake\n     ```\n\n4. **Review Model Changes:**\n   - Ensure that your model changes are properly reflected in the migration scripts.\n   - Sometimes manual adjustments in migration files are necessary if automatic detection fails.\n\n5. **Database Integrity Checks:**\n   - Run any database integrity checks provided by your database system to ensure there aren't other underlying issues.\n\n6. **Systematic Debugging:**\n   - If the issue persists, consider isolating changes by creating a new test database and applying migrations step-by-step to pinpoint where the problem occurs.\n\n7. **Consult Documentation:**\n   - As you're working with an older version of Django, refer to the Django 1.2.6 and South documentation for any version-specific quirks or issues.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the integrity error you're encountering. If the problem persists, consider seeking help from the community or forums specific to Django and South, as they might have encountered and solved similar issues."
