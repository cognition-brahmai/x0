        "content": "Is there a way to catch error codes when using Fabric to execute run() calls in a remote shell? Currently, Fabric stops as soon as a run() call returns a non-zero exit code. For some calls, like PNGOut, an error code of 2 is expected when it is unable to compress a file. I am currently circumventing this limitation by using shell logic, but I would like to keep my logic in Python, as per the Fabric promise. Is there a method to check for an error code and react to it rather than having Fabric stop functioning? I still want the default behaviors for other calls, so changing its behavior by modifying the environment doesn't seem like a good option."

        "content": "Yes, you can handle non-zero exit codes in Fabric without altering its default behavior by using Python exceptions. Fabric's `run()` function raises a `Failure` exception when a command returns a non-zero exit code. You can catch this exception to handle specific error codes.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to handle specific non-zero exit codes like the one from PNGOut, while letting other errors raise exceptions as usual:\n\n```python\nfrom fabric import Connection\nfrom invoke import UnexpectedExit\n\ndef execute_command(command):\n    try:\n        result = Connection('your_remote_host').run(command, warn=True)\n        if result.exited == 2:\n            # Handle the specific case where PNGOut returns 2\n            print(\"PNGOut returned exit code 2, which is expected in this context.\")\n        elif result.exited != 0:\n            # Handle other non-zero exit codes\n            print(f\"Command failed with exit code {result.exited}\")\n        else:\n            # Handle successful execution\n            print(\"Command executed successfully.\")\n    except UnexpectedExit as e:\n        # Handle unexpected errors\n        print(f\"Command failed unexpectedly: {e}\")\n\n# Example usage\nexecute_command('your_command_here')\n```\n\nIn this code, `warn=True` tells Fabric not to raise an exception automatically on a non-zero exit code, allowing you to handle it manually. You can then check `result.exited` to determine the exit code and react accordingly.\n\nThis approach allows you to handle specific error codes while still raising exceptions for unexpected failures, maintaining the default behavior for other commands."
