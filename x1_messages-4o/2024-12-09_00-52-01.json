The aim is to write a function `shuffle(df, n, axis=0)` that takes a DataFrame, a number of shuffles `n`, and an axis (`axis=0` is rows, `axis=1` is columns) and returns a copy of the DataFrame that has been shuffled `n` times. Also, when shuffling the rows, how can I shuffle each row independently, maintaining the associations between columns? Here is my initial attempt at this:\n\n```python\ndef shuffle(df, n, axis=0):\n    shuffled_df = df.copy()\n    for k in range(n):\n        shuffled_df.apply(np.random.shuffle(shuffled_df.values),axis=axis)\n    return shuffled_df\n\ndf = pandas.DataFrame({'A':range(10), 'B':range(10)})\nshuffle(df, 5)\n```"

        "content": "To create a function that shuffles a DataFrame a specified number of times along a given axis, maintaining the row or column labels, you can use the `pandas` and `numpy` libraries. Your initial attempt contains a few issues that need to be addressed:\n\n1. The `apply` method is not required for shuffling. You can directly use `numpy.random.shuffle`.\n2. When using `numpy.random.shuffle`, it operates in place, so there's no need to assign the result.\n3. Make sure to shuffle only the specified axis.\n\nHere's a revised version of the `shuffle` function that addresses these issues:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef shuffle(df, n, axis=0):\n    shuffled_df = df.copy()\n    \n    for _ in range(n):\n        if axis == 0:\n            # Shuffle rows\n            shuffled_df = shuffled_df.sample(frac=1).reset_index(drop=True)\n        elif axis == 1:\n            # Shuffle columns\n            shuffled_df = shuffled_df.sample(frac=1, axis=1)\n\n    return shuffled_df\n\n# Example usage\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'A': range(10), 'B': range(10)})\nshuffled_df = shuffle(df, 5, axis=0)\nprint(shuffled_df)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Shuffling Rows**: For shuffling rows (`axis=0`), the `sample` method is used with `frac=1` to shuffle all rows and reset the index to maintain order.\n  \n- **Shuffling Columns**: For shuffling columns (`axis=1`), the `sample` method is again used but with `axis=1` to shuffle columns instead of rows.\n\nThis function maintains the association between columns when shuffling rows, and vice versa, without altering the DataFrame's original structure."
