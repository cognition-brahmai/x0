The program should prompt the user for various inputs, such as a noun, a verb, an adjective, etc. Then, using those inputs, the program should create a story that uses metaphors to describe various elements of the story. The story should be printed to the console in a visually appealing format using HTML tags. Can you implement this program using Python?"
