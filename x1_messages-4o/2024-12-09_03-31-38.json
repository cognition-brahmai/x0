I also set the following environment variables:\n\n```\nexport CC=/usr/local/Cellar/llvm/4.0.0_1/bin/clang\nexport CXX=/usr/local/Cellar/llvm/4.0.0_1/bin/clang++\nexport CXX1X=/usr/local/Cellar/llvm/4.0.0_1/bin/clang++\n```\n\nBut I am getting the error \"ld: library not found for -lomp\". Even though llvm supports openmp, it still fails with this error. I also noticed that clang-omp has been discontinued with llvm's OpenMP support. How can I resolve this issue and successfully install xgboost with openmp on macOS Sierra?"

        "content": "Installing XGBoost with OpenMP support on macOS Sierra can be a bit tricky due to the way OpenMP is handled in macOS. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Install LLVM with OpenMP Support**: First, ensure LLVM is installed with OpenMP support. You can use Homebrew to install it:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew install llvm\n   ```\n\n2. **Set Compiler Paths**: After installing LLVM, ensure you are using the correct paths for the clang and clang++ compilers. The paths you provided seem to be specific; verify them:\n\n   ```bash\n   export CC=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang\n   export CXX=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang++\n   export CXX1X=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang++\n   ```\n\n3. **Install OpenMP**: You need to install OpenMP separately. You can do this via Homebrew:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew install libomp\n   ```\n\n4. **Link OpenMP Library**: Make sure the OpenMP library is correctly linked. You may need to specify the library path explicitly in your build configuration. You can set the `LDFLAGS` environment variable to include the path to the OpenMP library:\n\n   ```bash\n   export LDFLAGS=\"-L/usr/local/opt/libomp/lib\"\n   export CPPFLAGS=\"-I/usr/local/opt/libomp/include\"\n   ```\n\n5. **Modify Configuration Files**: Open the `config.mk` file in the XGBoost directory and ensure it's configured to use OpenMP. Add or modify the lines:\n\n   ```makefile\n   USE_OPENMP=1\n   ```\n\n6. **Build XGBoost**: Run the make command again:\n\n   ```bash\n   make -j4\n   ```\n\n7. **Check for Errors**: If you still encounter errors, check the output for specific missing dependencies or incorrect paths. Ensure that the paths specified in your environment variables match those on your system.\n\n8. **Try Linking Manually**: If automatic linking fails, you can try manually specifying the OpenMP library during the build process by adding `-lomp` to the `LDFLAGS` in the `config.mk` file.\n\n9. **Verify Installation**: Once the build completes without errors, verify the installation by importing XGBoost in Python:\n\n   ```python\n   import xgboost as xgb\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the \"library not found for -lomp\" error and successfully install XGBoost with OpenMP enabled on macOS Sierra."
