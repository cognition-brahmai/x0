I want to use `__init__.py` to organize these files into a module because modules are easier to use than packages due to having fewer namespace layers. However, I'm encountering several issues. When I use a blank `__init__.py`, none of my files are imported, which makes the module difficult to use. When I list the submodules in `__all__`, all of my classes are behind namespace barriers again. And when I add `from thatfile import X` statements to `__init__.py`, I get namespace conflicts and extra namespaces for things I didn't want to be in there. What is the correct way to split related code up but still collect it in a module-like way?"

        "content": "When you want to organize multiple Python files into a single module-like structure without the complexity of additional namespace layers that packages introduce, you can refactor your code structure and utilize the `__init__.py` file effectively. Here\u2019s a way to achieve this while maintaining a flat namespace:\n\n1. **Directory Structure:**\n   Ensure your directory structure looks something like this:\n\n   ```\n   mymodule/\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 file1.py\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 file2.py\n   \u2514\u2500\u2500 file3.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Using `__init__.py` for Namespace Flattening:**\n   You can use the `__init__.py` file to import the necessary classes, functions, or variables from each submodule (file1, file2, file3) directly into the `mymodule` namespace. This way, you can access them without additional namespace layers.\n\n   Here's an example of how `__init__.py` might look:\n\n   ```python\n   # __init__.py\n   from .file1 import ClassA, function1\n   from .file2 import ClassB, function2\n   from .file3 import ClassC, function3\n\n   # Optionally, define what should be accessible when doing 'from mymodule import *'\n   __all__ = ['ClassA', 'function1', 'ClassB', 'function2', 'ClassC', 'function3']\n   ```\n\n3. **Avoid Namespace Conflicts:**\n   - Ensure that each submodule (like `file1.py`, `file2.py`, etc.) does not have overlapping names unless intended. If conflicts are unavoidable, consider renaming them within the submodules or during import in `__init__.py`.\n   - If two files have a `ClassA`, you might import them with aliases:\n     ```python\n     from .file1 import ClassA as File1ClassA\n     from .file2 import ClassA as File2ClassA\n     ```\n\n4. **Accessing the module:**\n   After setting up your `__init__.py`, you can import your module and access its components directly:\n\n   ```python\n   import mymodule\n\n   objA = mymodule.ClassA()\n   objB = mymodule.ClassB()\n   ```\n\n5. **Testing Imports:**\n   Always test your imports to ensure that they are working as expected. Mistakes in relative imports are common when reorganizing files, so verify paths and names match exactly.\n\nBy following these steps, you can achieve a module-like structure with a flat namespace using `__init__.py` without the additional complexity of package layers."
