I am using `<path>` in the rule and it works fine for `/get_dir/one` but fails to work for `/get_dir/one/two`. Can you advise on how I can capture an arbitrary path, such that `path='/one/two/etc'` will be successfully passed to the view function? Here's my current implementation:\n\n```python\n@app.route('/get_dir/<path>')\ndef get_dir(path):\n    return path\n```"

This tells Flask to capture the entire path, including any slashes, as a single string. Here's how you can modify your route to capture a path like `/one/two/etc`:\n\n```python\n@app.route('/get_dir/<path:path>')\ndef get_dir(path):\n    return path\n```\n\nIn this updated route, `<path:path>` tells Flask to treat everything after `/get_dir/` as part of the `path` variable, including any subdirectories separated by slashes. This way, a request to `/get_dir/one/two` will correctly result in `path='one/two'`."
