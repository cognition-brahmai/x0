In this file, I am interested in two specific columns, column 59 (with the header 'star_name') and column 60 (with the header 'ra'). However, the authors of the webpage sometimes change the position of the columns. How can I read these columns in a way that would not cause my program to malfunction in the future if the column positions are changed, but the column names remain the same?"

        "content": "To read specific columns from a CSV file in a way that is robust to changes in the column order, you can use a library like `pandas` in Python. `pandas` allows you to select columns by their names rather than their positions, which makes your code more reliable if the column positions change but the names stay the same.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Install `pandas`**: If you haven't already, you can install the `pandas` library using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install pandas\n   ```\n\n2. **Read the CSV file**: Use `pandas` to read the CSV file and select the columns by their names.\n\nHere is an example code snippet:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the CSV file\nfile_path = 'your_file.csv'  # Replace with your actual file path\ndata = pd.read_csv(file_path)\n\n# Select the columns by their names\ntry:\n    star_name_column = data['star_name']\n    ra_column = data['ra']\nexcept KeyError as e:\n    print(f\"Column not found: {e}\")\n\n# Display the selected columns (optional)\nprint(star_name_column)\nprint(ra_column)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`pd.read_csv(file_path)`**: This reads the entire CSV file into a DataFrame.\n- **`data['star_name']` and `data['ra']`**: This selects the specific columns using their names.\n- **`try-except` block**: This handles the case where the columns might not be present, providing a helpful error message.\n\nThis approach ensures that as long as the column names remain the same, your program will function correctly, even if the positions of the columns change."
