        "content": "Certainly! Here are five features commonly found in hybrid cars:\n\n1. **Dual Power Sources**: Hybrid cars utilize both an internal combustion engine and an electric motor. This combination allows the vehicle to switch between or simultaneously use both power sources for optimal efficiency and performance.\n\n2. **Regenerative Braking**: This feature captures and converts the kinetic energy generated during braking into electrical energy, which is then stored in the battery. This process helps improve fuel efficiency and extends the range of the vehicle.\n\n3. **Fuel Efficiency**: Hybrid cars are designed to maximize fuel efficiency by utilizing the electric motor at low speeds and during stop-and-go traffic. This reduces fuel consumption and emissions compared to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles.\n\n4. **Automatic Start/Stop**: Many hybrid cars come with an automatic start/stop system that shuts down the engine when the vehicle is stationary, such as at traffic lights, and restarts it when the driver accelerates. This feature helps conserve fuel and reduce emissions.\n\n5. **Eco Mode**: Hybrid vehicles often include an Eco Mode that modifies the vehicle\u2019s performance settings to prioritize fuel efficiency. This mode typically adjusts throttle response, air conditioning efficiency, and other parameters to reduce fuel consumption."
