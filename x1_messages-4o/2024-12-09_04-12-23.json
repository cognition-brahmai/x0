I am trying to subtract one date value from `datetime.datetime.today()` to calculate the duration between two dates, but I am encountering a `TypeError: can't subtract offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes`. It appears the value returned from `datetime.datetime.today()` doesn't have a timezone, whilst my other date value does. I would prefer the function to automatically know the timezone. Currently, it provides the time in local time, which is PST or UTC - 8 hours. If necessary, is there a way to manually enter a timezone value into the datetime object returned by `datetime.datetime.today()` and set it to UTC-8?"

        "content": "To work with timezone-aware `datetime` objects in Python, you can use the `pytz` library, which allows you to convert naive `datetime` objects (without timezone information) to timezone-aware ones. The `datetime.datetime.today()` function returns a naive `datetime` object, so you'll need to convert it to a timezone-aware object before performing any operations with other timezone-aware datetimes.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Install `pytz`**: If you haven't already installed `pytz`, you can do so using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pytz\n   ```\n\n2. **Convert to Timezone-Aware `datetime`:** Use `pytz` to localize the naive `datetime` returned by `datetime.datetime.today()`.\n\nHere's a sample code snippet to help you:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport pytz\n\n# Get the current time in UTC\nutc_now = datetime.now(pytz.utc)\n\n# Alternatively, if you want to get the current time in a specific timezone, e.g., PST\npst = pytz.timezone('America/Los_Angeles')\npst_now = datetime.now(pst)\n\n# Example of a timezone-aware datetime object you're comparing against\n# Let's assume you have a timezone-aware datetime object `other_date`\n# For demonstration, let's create one:\nother_date = datetime(2023, 10, 1, 12, 0, 0, tzinfo=pytz.utc)\n\n# Calculate the duration between the two dates\nduration = pst_now - other_date\n\nprint(\"Duration:\", duration)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`datetime.now(pytz.utc)`** gives you the current time as a timezone-aware `datetime` object in UTC.\n- **`pytz.timezone('America/Los_Angeles')`** provides the PST timezone, accounting for daylight saving time adjustments automatically. You can replace `'America/Los_Angeles'` with any other timezone if needed.\n- **`datetime.now(pst)`** gives you the current time in the PST timezone as a timezone-aware `datetime`.\n- **Duration Calculation**: Ensure both `datetime` objects are timezone-aware before subtracting them to avoid errors.\n\nThis approach ensures that your calculations are consistent and free from timezone-related issues."
