After building Python (version 2.7.1), do I need to rebuild Python if there are missing modules? Also, is there any method to figure out which modules will be missing prior to building Python? I'm having trouble with sqlite3 module which, despite being installed for the system default Python 2.6.6, is not available when I build Python 2.7.1 using pythonbrew. I am wondering how I can resolve the problem of missing modules in Python. However, I am open to learning how to build Python without using pythonbrew. Can you help me with this?"

        "content": "Building Python from source on an older system like Ubuntu 10.10 can be a bit challenging, especially with dependencies for different modules. Let's walk through the process and address your specific issue with the `sqlite3` module.\n\n### Steps to Build Python and Handle Missing Modules\n\n1. **Dependencies Check**: Before building Python, ensure you have all the necessary development libraries. You can install them using:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install build-essential\n   sudo apt-get install libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev\n   sudo apt-get install libncursesw5-dev libgdbm-dev libc6-dev libffi-dev tk-dev\n   ```\n\n2. **Download and Extract Python Source**:\n   - Download the desired Python version source from the official website.\n   - Extract it using:\n     ```bash\n     tar -xvf Python-2.7.1.tgz\n     cd Python-2.7.1\n     ```\n\n3. **Configure and Build**:\n   - Run the configure script to prepare the build environment:\n     ```bash\n     ./configure --enable-optimizations\n     ```\n   - Compile the source code:\n     ```bash\n     make\n     ```\n   - Install Python:\n     ```bash\n     sudo make install\n     ```\n\n4. **Check for Missing Modules**:\n   - After building, you can check which modules are missing by running:\n     ```bash\n     python2.7 -m test\n     ```\n   - This will run a suite of tests and report any issues with modules.\n\n5. **Resolving Missing `sqlite3` Module**:\n   - The `sqlite3` module requires the `libsqlite3-dev` package. Ensure this is installed before configuring and building Python.\n   - If it is missing, reinstall and then rebuild Python:\n     ```bash\n     sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev\n     make clean\n     ./configure --enable-optimizations\n     make\n     sudo make install\n     ```\n\n6. **Building Without Pythonbrew**:\n   - The steps above guide you through building Python from source, which doesn't require pythonbrew. This manual method allows more control over the build process, especially for resolving dependencies.\n\n7. **Verify Installation**:\n   - After installation, verify that the `sqlite3` module is available:\n     ```bash\n     python2.7 -c \"import sqlite3; print(sqlite3.version)\"\n     ```\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- **Virtual Environments**: Consider using virtual environments (`virtualenv`) for managing dependencies and packages for different Python projects.\n- **Upgrade OS**: Ubuntu 10.10 is quite outdated. Consider upgrading to a newer version of Ubuntu for better support and compatibility with modern software packages.\n- **Alternative Package Managers**: Consider using `pyenv` as an alternative to pythonbrew for managing multiple Python versions more effectively.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to build Python with all required modules and resolve the issue with the `sqlite3` module specifically."
