        "content": "You can achieve this by using a list comprehension in Python, which is a concise way to create lists. You can iterate over each element in the list and replace the specified element with the new value. Here's how you can replace all occurrences of the number `1` with `10` in your list:\n\n```python\na = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]\na = [10 if x == 1 else x for x in a]\nprint(a)\n```\n\nIn this code, the list comprehension `[10 if x == 1 else x for x in a]` iterates through each element `x` in the list `a`. If `x` is equal to `1`, it replaces it with `10`; otherwise, it keeps the element as is. The result is a new list where all `1`s have been replaced with `10`s, which is then assigned back to `a`."
