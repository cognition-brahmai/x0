Could you explain why I might want to do this?"

        "content": "To calculate and retrieve the loss per epoch instead of per batch in your GAN training loop, you can modify your code to accumulate the loss values for each batch and then compute the average at the end of each epoch. Here's how you can adjust your code:\n\n```python\n# Initialize lists to store the epoch losses\ndiscriminator_losses = []\ngenerator_losses = []\n\nfor epoch in range(num_epochs):\n    # Initialize variables to accumulate losses\n    total_discriminator_loss = 0.0\n    total_generator_loss = 0.0\n    num_batches = 0\n\n    for batch in dataset:\n        num_batches += 1\n\n        # Generate fake data\n        fakes = generator.predict_on_batch(batch)\n\n        # Train discriminator\n        dlc = discriminator.train_on_batch(batch, real_labels)\n        dlf = discriminator.train_on_batch(fakes, fake_labels)\n        dis_loss_total = 0.5 * np.add(dlc, dlf)\n        total_discriminator_loss += dis_loss_total\n\n        # Train generator\n        g_loss = gan.train_on_batch(batch, real_labels)\n        total_generator_loss += g_loss\n\n    # Calculate average losses for the epoch\n    avg_discriminator_loss = total_discriminator_loss / num_batches\n    avg_generator_loss = total_generator_loss / num_batches\n\n    # Append the epoch losses to the lists\n    discriminator_losses.append(avg_discriminator_loss)\n    generator_losses.append(avg_generator_loss)\n\n    # Optionally print the epoch losses\n    print(f\"Epoch {epoch + 1}/{num_epochs} - Discriminator Loss: {avg_discriminator_loss}, Generator Loss: {avg_generator_loss}\")\n\n# Now, the lists discriminator_losses and generator_losses contain the average losses per epoch\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `total_discriminator_loss` and `total_generator_loss` accumulate the batch losses.\n- `num_batches` keeps track of the number of batches processed in an epoch.\n- At the end of each epoch, you calculate the average loss by dividing the total loss by the number of batches.\n\n### Benefits of Calculating Loss per Epoch:\n\n1. **Smoothing Out Variations**: Batch losses can fluctuate significantly due to the stochastic nature of training. Calculating the average loss per epoch provides a smoother, more stable measure of training progress.\n   \n2. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitoring epoch-level losses helps to assess the overall performance of the model over time, making it easier to identify trends such as overfitting or underfitting.\n\n3. **Reduced Noise**: By focusing on epoch-level losses, you reduce the noise inherent in batch-level calculations, which can help in better understanding the learning dynamics.\n\n4. **Tracking Long-Term Trends**: It's easier to visualize and track long-term learning trends when you have one loss value per epoch, which is particularly useful for plotting and analyzing training curves.\n\nOverall, while batch losses are useful for immediate feedback and adjustments during training, epoch-level losses provide a broader overview and are often more indicative of the model's learning trajectory."
