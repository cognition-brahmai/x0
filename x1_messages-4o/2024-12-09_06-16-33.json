I have a boolean field in a MySQL database table which I have modeled in SQLAlchemy as follows:\n\n```python\n# table model\nclass TestCase(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'test_cases'\n    ...\n    obsoleted = Column('obsoleted',  Boolean)\n```\n\nI am trying to get the count of all the non-obsoleted test cases with the following code:\n\n```python\ncaseNum = session.query(TestCase).filter(TestCase.obsoleted == False).count()\nprint(caseNum)\n```\n\nThis works fine, but flake8 reports a warning: \"E712: Comparison to False should be 'if cond is False:' or 'if not cond:'\". To avoid this warning, I tried changing the code to use 'is' or 'not' operators like this:\n\n```python\ncaseNum = session.query(TestCase).filter(TestCase.obsoleted is False).count()\n```\n\nor\n\n```python\ncaseNum = session.query(TestCase).filter(not TestCase.obsoleted).count()\n```\n\nHowever, neither of these alternatives work and the result is always 0. I believe the filter clause doesn't support the 'is' or 'is not' operators. How can I handle this situation without disabling flake8?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the way SQLAlchemy constructs queries. In SQLAlchemy, the `filter` method requires a SQL expression, and using Python's `is` or `not` operators directly doesn't translate correctly into SQL expressions. Instead, you should use SQLAlchemy's expression constructs.\n\nHere's how you can address this issue while adhering to PEP 8 and avoiding the flake8 warning:\n\n### Use `is_` Method:\n\nSQLAlchemy provides the `is_` method to construct SQL expressions that check for equality or inequality with boolean values.\n\n```python\ncaseNum = session.query(TestCase).filter(TestCase.obsoleted.is_(False)).count()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`is_` Method**: The `is_` method is specifically designed for SQL comparison and should be used when you intend to compare a column against a boolean value or `None`. This method constructs the appropriate SQL expression to perform the comparison.\n\n- **Avoiding Warnings**: Using the `is_` method prevents the flake8 warning because it adheres to the PEP 8 guidelines by making the comparison explicit in the SQLAlchemy context.\n\nThis approach should give you the correct count of non-obsoleted test cases without causing any warnings in your linter."
