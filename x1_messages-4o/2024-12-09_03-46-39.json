However, when I try to add some more parameters to it like this: `alias rxvt='urxvt -fg '#111111' -bg '#111111''`, it doesn't work. I tried escaping the inner single quotes with backslashes, like so: `alias rxvt='urxvt -fg \\'#111111\\' -bg \\'#111111\\''`, but that didn't work either. I attempted to match up opening and closing quotes inside the string once I escaped the quotes, but it looks rather ungainly: `alias rxvt='urxvt -fg'\\''#111111'\\'' -bg '\\''#111111'\\''. Would this string represent the same string if I'm allowed to concatenate them like that?"

        "content": "Yes, in Bash, when you need to include a single quote inside a single-quoted string, you can end the single-quoted string, insert an escaped single quote, and then start a new single-quoted string. This is essentially what you are doing with the following:\n\n```bash\nalias rxvt='urxvt -fg'\\''#111111'\\'' -bg '\\''#111111'\\'\n```\n\nThis method is valid and is indeed how you handle single quotes within single-quoted strings in Bash. The `'\\''` sequence is interpreted as: end the current single-quoted string, add a literal single quote, and start a new single-quoted string.\n\nThis approach effectively concatenates the strings while including the single quotes as intended. It might look a bit ungainly, but it is a standard way to handle such situations in Bash.\n\nSo, yes, this string represents the same command you intended to form, and it should work as you expect when you set your alias with these parameters."
