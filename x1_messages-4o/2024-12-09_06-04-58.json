The structure of my class is as follows:\n\n```python\nclass Wizard:\n    def __init__(self, argv):\n        self.parse_arguments(argv)\n        self.wave_wand()  # declaration omitted\n\n    def parse_arguments(self, argv):\n        if self.has_correct_argument_count(argv):\n            self.name = argv[0]\n            self.magic_ability = argv[1]\n        else:\n            raise InvalidArgumentsException()  # declaration omitted\n```\n\nHowever, when I run my code in the interpreter, I get a complaint from Pylint saying: \"Instance attribute attribute_name defined outside __init__\". I've tried looking for solutions online, but haven't found anything useful. It seems unorganized to keep all constructor logic in __init__, and turning off the Pylint warning also seems like a hack. What is the Pythonic way to resolve this problem?"

        "content": "The warning from Pylint is indicating that you're defining instance attributes outside of the `__init__` method, which can potentially lead to issues with code readability and maintainability. While it's common to define instance attributes in `__init__`, it's also acceptable to define them in other methods if needed. However, to keep your code clean and avoid Pylint warnings, you can initialize the attributes with default values in the `__init__` method, and then set their actual values later in other methods.\n\nHere's a Pythonic approach to modify your class:\n\n```python\nclass Wizard:\n    def __init__(self, argv):\n        self.name = None\n        self.magic_ability = None\n        self.parse_arguments(argv)\n        self.wave_wand()  # declaration omitted\n\n    def parse_arguments(self, argv):\n        if self.has_correct_argument_count(argv):\n            self.name = argv[0]\n            self.magic_ability = argv[1]\n        else:\n            raise InvalidArgumentsException()  # declaration omitted\n\n    def has_correct_argument_count(self, argv):\n        # Assuming we need exactly two arguments for a valid Wizard\n        return len(argv) == 2\n\n    def wave_wand(self):\n        # Implementation for waving the wand\n        pass\n\n# Exception class definition\nclass InvalidArgumentsException(Exception):\n    pass\n```\n\nIn this revised version, `self.name` and `self.magic_ability` are initialized with default values (`None`) in the `__init__` method. This approach keeps Pylint happy and makes it clear which attributes belong to the class. You can later assign the actual values in the `parse_arguments` method, ensuring that the attributes are always defined."
