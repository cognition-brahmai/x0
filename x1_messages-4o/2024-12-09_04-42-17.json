I then created a new page preferences.html within the /templates/admin/preferences/ directory and added a url to urls.py. However, when I run it, I receive an error saying \"The requested admin page does not exist\". What could be causing this issue?\n\nHere is the structure of my project:\n\nmysite/\n    templates/\n        admin/\n            index.html\n\nThe code added to the apps block is as follows:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"module\">\n    <table summary=\"{% blocktrans with name=\"preferences\" %}Models available in the preferences application.{% endblocktrans %}\">\n        <caption><a href=\"preferences\" class=\"section\">{% blocktrans with name=\"preferences\" %}Preferences{% endblocktrans %}</a></caption>\n            <tr>\n                <th scope=\"row\"><a href=\"preferences\">Preferences</a></th>\n                <td><a href=\"preferences\" class=\"changelink\">{% trans 'Change' %}</a></td>\n            </tr>\n    </table>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe code in urls.py is as follows:\n\n```python\nurl(r'^admin/preferences/$', TemplateView.as_view(template_name='admin/preferences/preferences.html')),\n```\n\nThe code in preferences.html is as follows:\n\n```html\n{% extends \"admin/base_site.html\" %}\n{% block title %}Test page{% endblock %}\n```"

        "content": "Creating a custom admin page in Django without a model involves a few key steps, and it looks like you are on the right track, but there might be a few things to check and adjust. Let's go through some potential issues and solutions:\n\n1. **Template Path:** Ensure that the path to your `preferences.html` template is correct. It should match the path specified in your `TemplateView` in `urls.py`. Your directory structure should look like this:\n\n    ```\n    mysite/\n        templates/\n            admin/\n                preferences/\n                    preferences.html\n    ```\n\n2. **URL Configuration:** Make sure your URL pattern is correctly configured. It seems like you might need to use the `path` function instead of `url` if you are using Django 2.0 or later. Here's how you can define it:\n\n    ```python\n    from django.urls import path\n    from django.views.generic import TemplateView\n\n    urlpatterns = [\n        path('admin/preferences/', TemplateView.as_view(template_name='admin/preferences/preferences.html'), name='admin-preferences'),\n    ]\n    ```\n\n3. **Admin Index Template:** Your modifications to `index.html` look fine, but ensure that the links are correctly pointing to the URL you've defined. The link should be `/admin/preferences/` if you are using the `path` function as shown above.\n\n4. **URL Resolution:** Use the Django template tag `{% url 'admin-preferences' %}` to ensure that the URL is being resolved correctly in your templates. Update your links in `index.html`:\n\n    ```html\n    <div class=\"module\">\n        <table summary=\"{% blocktrans with name=\"preferences\" %}Models available in the preferences application.{% endblocktrans %}\">\n            <caption><a href=\"{% url 'admin-preferences' %}\" class=\"section\">{% blocktrans with name=\"preferences\" %}Preferences{% endblocktrans %}</a></caption>\n                <tr>\n                    <th scope=\"row\"><a href=\"{% url 'admin-preferences' %}\">Preferences</a></th>\n                    <td><a href=\"{% url 'admin-preferences' %}\" class=\"changelink\">{% trans 'Change' %}</a></td>\n                </tr>\n        </table>\n    </div>\n    ```\n\n5. **Server Restart:** After making these changes, restart your Django development server to ensure all changes are loaded.\n\n6. **Django Version Compatibility:** Ensure that the Django version you are using supports the syntax and features you are implementing. If you are using an older version, some features might not be available or could be different.\n\nBy following these steps and checking the potential issues, you should be able to resolve the error and successfully create a custom admin page without a model in Django."
