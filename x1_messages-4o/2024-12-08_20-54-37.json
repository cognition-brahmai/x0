        "content": "Certainly! To achieve this, we need to check two conditions: \n\n1. The sum of X, Y, and Z is a specific value.\n2. The sum of the squares of X, Y, and Z is a perfect square.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that demonstrates how to assign values to X, Y, and Z and check both conditions:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Assign values to X, Y, and Z\nX = 3\nY = 4\nZ = 5\n\n# Function to check if a number is a perfect square\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    return int(math.sqrt(n))**2 == n\n\n# Check if the sum of X, Y, and Z is a specific value (e.g., 12)\nsum_value = 12\nsum_xyz = X + Y + Z\n\n# Check if the sum of the squares of X, Y, and Z is a perfect square\nsum_of_squares = X**2 + Y**2 + Z**2\nis_sum_of_squares_perfect = is_perfect_square(sum_of_squares)\n\n# Print results\nif sum_xyz == sum_value:\n    print(f\"The sum of X, Y, and Z is {sum_value}.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"The sum of X, Y, and Z is not {sum_value}.\")\n\nif is_sum_of_squares_perfect:\n    print(f\"The sum of the squares of X, Y, and Z is a perfect square: {sum_of_squares}.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"The sum of the squares of X, Y, and Z is not a perfect square.\")\n```\n\nIn the above code:\n- We define a function `is_perfect_square(n)` to check if a number is a perfect square.\n- We assign example values to `X`, `Y`, and `Z` and calculate their sum and the sum of their squares.\n- We then check if the sum equals a specific value (e.g., 12) and if the sum of the squares is a perfect square, printing the results for both conditions."
