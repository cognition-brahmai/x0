        "content": "To arrange the chemical elements erbium, strontium, osmium, and palladium in increasing order based on their atomic mass using PHP, you can create an associative array where each element is a key, and its atomic mass is the value. Then, you can use the `asort()` function to sort the array by value in ascending order. Here is a code snippet to achieve this:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Define an associative array with elements and their atomic masses\n$elements = [\n    'Erbium' => 167.26,    // Er\n    'Strontium' => 87.62,  // Sr\n    'Osmium' => 190.23,    // Os\n    'Palladium' => 106.42  // Pd\n];\n\n// Sort the array by atomic mass in ascending order\nasort($elements);\n\n// Display the sorted elements\necho \"Elements in increasing order based on atomic mass:\\n\";\nforeach ($elements as $element => $atomicMass) {\n    echo $element . \" (\" . $atomicMass . \")\\n\";\n}\n?>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Associative Array**: We create an associative array `$elements` where the keys are the names of the elements, and the values are their respective atomic masses.\n- **Sorting**: We use the `asort()` function, which sorts the array while maintaining the association between keys and values, to sort the elements by atomic mass.\n- **Output**: We loop through the sorted array and print each element along with its atomic mass.\n\nWhen you run this PHP script, you will get the elements arranged in increasing order of their atomic mass."
