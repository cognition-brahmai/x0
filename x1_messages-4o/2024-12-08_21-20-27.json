        "content": "To summarize each article efficiently and accurately while storing the results in a separate table, you can follow the algorithm outlined below:\n\n### Algorithm Steps:\n\n1. **Data Preparation:**\n   - Load the dataset containing the news articles with fields `Article_Id`, `Title`, and `Text`.\n\n2. **Preprocessing:**\n   - For each article, preprocess the text to clean and normalize it (e.g., remove special characters, convert to lowercase, tokenize).\n\n3. **Sentence Scoring:**\n   - Use a natural language processing library (e.g., spaCy, NLTK, or a transformer model like BERT) to extract and score sentences based on their importance. The output should be a list of tuples: `[(sentence_1, score_1), (sentence_2, score_2), ...]`.\n\n4. **Calculate Average Words per Sentence:**\n   - For each article, calculate the average number of words per sentence to determine how many sentences you need to select to reach approximately 200 words.\n\n5. **Select Top N Sentences:**\n   - Sort the list of sentences by their scores in descending order.\n   - Determine `N`, the number of sentences to include, by dividing the desired summary length (200 words) by the average number of words per sentence.\n   - Select the top `N` sentences based on their scores.\n\n6. **Concatenate Sentences:**\n   - Concatenate the selected sentences to form a coherent summary text for each article.\n\n7. **Store Summaries:**\n   - Create a new table with fields `Article_Id` and `Summary`.\n   - Insert each `Article_Id` and its corresponding summary into this new table.\n\n8. **Optimization:**\n   - Consider parallel processing or batch processing techniques to handle large datasets more efficiently.\n   - Implement caching or indexing strategies if the dataset frequently changes or is queried often.\n\n### Example Implementation (Pseudocode):\n\n```python\nimport some_nlp_library as nlp  # Placeholder for the actual library you'll use\n\ndef summarize_articles(articles):\n    summaries = []\n    for article in articles:\n        article_id = article['Article_Id']\n        text = article['Text']\n        \n        # Step 3: Extract and score sentences\n        scored_sentences = nlp.extract_and_score_sentences(text)\n        \n        # Step 4: Calculate average words per sentence\n        sentences = [s[0] for s in scored_sentences]\n        avg_words_per_sentence = sum(len(s.split()) for s in sentences) / len(sentences)\n        \n        # Step 5: Select top N sentences\n        scored_sentences.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n        num_sentences = int(200 / avg_words_per_sentence)\n        selected_sentences = [s[0] for s in scored_sentences[:num_sentences]]\n        \n        # Step 6: Concatenate sentences\n        summary = ' '.join(selected_sentences)\n        \n        # Step 7: Store summary\n        summaries.append({'Article_Id': article_id, 'Summary': summary})\n    \n    # Insert summaries into the new table\n    insert_summaries_into_table(summaries)\n\n# Helper function to insert summaries into a database table\ndef insert_summaries_into_table(summaries):\n    # Implement database insertion logic here\n    pass\n```\n\n### Considerations:\n- Ensure that the NLP library you choose is capable of efficiently handling large datasets.\n- The algorithm assumes that the average number of words per sentence is relatively consistent across articles. Adjust `N` dynamically if needed.\n- Pay attention to edge cases, such as extremely short articles or articles with unusually long sentences."
