        "content": "To assign a variable based on the values of three booleans in a concise and Pythonic way, you can use a tuple as a key to a dictionary. This approach offers clarity and simplicity without the awkwardness you mentioned. Here's an example:\n\n```python\n# Define the boolean variables\nbool1 = True\nbool2 = False\nbool3 = True\n\n# Create a dictionary with tuples as keys\nresult_mapping = {\n    (True, True, True): \"All true\",\n    (True, True, False): \"First two true\",\n    (True, False, True): \"First and last true\",\n    (True, False, False): \"Only first true\",\n    (False, True, True): \"Last two true\",\n    (False, True, False): \"Only second true\",\n    (False, False, True): \"Only last true\",\n    (False, False, False): \"All false\"\n}\n\n# Get the result based on the boolean values\nresult = result_mapping[(bool1, bool2, bool3)]\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis method is clear and reduces the complexity of nested if-elif statements. It allows you to directly map the combination of boolean values to the desired result in a readable format."
