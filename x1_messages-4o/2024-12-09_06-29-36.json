When running these two sets of code, I find that the value of y is different in each case. Why does this discrepancy occur?\n\nHere is the two sets of code:\n\nFirst set:\n\n```python\nx = 1\ny = 2\nx,y = y,x+y\nprint(x)\nprint(y)\n```\nOutput:\n```python\n2\n3\n```\n\nSecond set:\n\n```python\nx = 1\ny = 2\nx = y\ny = x+y\nprint(x)\nprint(y)\n```\nOutput:\n```python\n2\n4\n```"

        "content": "The discrepancy between the two sets of code arises from the difference in how the values are assigned and the order of operations.\n\n### First Set:\n```python\nx = 1\ny = 2\nx, y = y, x + y\nprint(x)  # Output: 2\nprint(y)  # Output: 3\n```\nIn this set, the expression `x, y = y, x + y` is using tuple unpacking, which evaluates the right-hand side first before making any assignments. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n1. The right-hand side `(y, x + y)` is evaluated to `(2, 1 + 2)`, which is `(2, 3)`.\n2. Then, `x` is assigned the value `2`, and `y` is assigned the value `3`.\n\n### Second Set:\n```python\nx = 1\ny = 2\nx = y\ny = x + y\nprint(x)  # Output: 2\nprint(y)  # Output: 4\n```\nIn this set, the assignments happen sequentially, one by one:\n1. First, `x` is assigned the value of `y`, which is `2`.\n2. Then, `y` is assigned `x + y`, which is `2 + 2 = 4`. Note that at this point, `x` is already updated to `2`, so the addition results in `4`.\n\n### Key Difference:\n- **First Set:** Both assignments `x` and `y` take place simultaneously after calculating the right-hand side values. The original values of `x` and `y` are used to compute the new values.\n- **Second Set:** The assignments occur sequentially, meaning the updated value of `x` is used immediately in the subsequent calculation for `y`.\n\nThis difference in order of operations and how the assignments are handled leads to the discrepancy in the value of `y` in the two sets of code."
