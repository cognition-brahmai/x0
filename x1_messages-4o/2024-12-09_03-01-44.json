        "content": "The \"Token Error: EOF in multi-line statement\" usually indicates that there's a syntax issue, often related to improper use of quotes or parentheses. In your code, you have a multi-line string that isn't properly formatted. Here are the specific issues and how you can fix them:\n\n1. **Quotation Marks**: You're using single quotes for your strings, but there are missing closing quotes for each line. Strings in Python need to be properly enclosed within matching quotes.\n\n2. **Line Continuation**: When you have a long list of strings in a tuple, you can split them across multiple lines, but each line needs to be properly formatted.\n\n3. **Triple Quotes for Multi-line Strings**: If you want to have a cleaner multi-line string, consider using triple quotes (`'''` or `\"\"\"`) to enclose your entire string.\n\nHere's a corrected version of your code using triple quotes for better readability:\n\n```python\nBAI_var = easygui.choicebox(\n    msg='Please identify your thinking traps: \\n \\n',\n    title='Thought Log(Identify Your Thinking Traps)',\n    choices=(\n        '''FORTUNE-TELLING: This occurs when we predict that things will turn out badly.

Make sure each choice is separated by a comma to maintain the tuple structure."
