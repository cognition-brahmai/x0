However, I am encountering a problem where there is verbose `INFO` logging after each command that I am unable to turn off. I tried various scenarios in the `log4j.properties` file in the `conf` folder where I launch the application from, including commenting out and setting to OFF, but nothing seems to work. How can I turn off the verbose `INFO` logging in Spark?"

        "content": "To reduce or turn off the verbose `INFO` logging in Apache Spark, you need to configure the `log4j` settings correctly. Here are the steps you can follow:\n\n1. **Locate the `log4j.properties` File:**\n   Ensure you are editing the correct `log4j.properties` file. This file is typically located in the `conf` directory of your Spark installation.\n\n2. **Edit the `log4j.properties` File:**\n   Open the `log4j.properties` file and look for the root logger configuration line. It will look something like this:\n\n   ```\n   log4j.rootCategory=INFO, console\n   ```\n\n   Change the `INFO` level to `ERROR` or `WARN` to reduce the logging verbosity:\n\n   ```\n   log4j.rootCategory=ERROR, console\n   ```\n\n   This change will limit the logs to only errors (or warnings if you choose `WARN`).\n\n3. **Set Specific Logger Levels:**\n   If you want to adjust the logging level for specific packages, you can add or modify lines like these:\n\n   ```\n   log4j.logger.org.apache.spark=ERROR\n   log4j.logger.org.apache.hadoop=ERROR\n   ```\n\n   This will set the logging level for Spark and Hadoop related logs to `ERROR`.\n\n4. **Apply the Changes:**\n   After making changes to the `log4j.properties` file, save it and then restart your Spark application or session to apply the changes.\n\n5. **Alternative Method (Using Spark Configuration):**\n   If you prefer not to modify the `log4j.properties` file directly or if your changes don't take effect, you can also set logging levels programmatically by adding the following lines to your Spark script:\n\n   ```python\n   from pyspark import SparkConf\n   from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\n   # Create a SparkConf object\n   conf = SparkConf()\n\n   # Set log level to ERROR\n   spark = SparkSession.builder \\\n       .config(conf=conf) \\\n       .getOrCreate()\n\n   # Set log level\n   spark.sparkContext.setLogLevel(\"ERROR\")\n   ```\n\n6. **Verify the Changes:**\n   After restarting your Spark application, execute a few commands to verify that the logging verbosity has been reduced as expected.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to reduce or eliminate the verbose `INFO` logging in your Spark application."
