I have a function that returns the first result of re.findall, or an empty default. I want to be able to use this function to do things like extracting the first, last, and phone number from a string. However, I'm stuck at implementing a function called `num_of_groups` that should return the number of groups in the given regular expression. Here is my function:\n\n```python\ndef groups(regexp, s):\n    \"\"\" Returns the first result of re.findall, or an empty default\n\n    >>> groups(r'(\\d)(\\d)(\\d)', '123')\n    ('1', '2', '3')\n    >>> groups(r'(\\d)(\\d)(\\d)', 'abc')\n    ('', '', '')\n    \"\"\"\n    import re\n    m = re.search(regexp, s)\n    if m:\n        return m.groups()\n    return ('',) * num_of_groups(regexp)\n```\n\nAnd this is how I plan to use it:\n\n```python\nfirst, last, phone = groups(r'(\\w+) (\\w+) ([\\d\\-]+)', 'John Doe 555-3456')\n```\n\nHow can I implement the `num_of_groups` function?"

        "content": "To implement the `num_of_groups` function, you can utilize the `re` module in Python, specifically the `re.compile` method, which compiles a regular expression pattern into a regular expression object. This object has a method called `groups`, which returns the number of capturing groups in the pattern. Here's how you can implement the `num_of_groups` function:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef num_of_groups(regexp):\n    \"\"\"Return the number of capturing groups in the regular expression.\"\"\"\n    pattern = re.compile(regexp)\n    return pattern.groups\n\ndef groups(regexp, s):\n    \"\"\" Returns the first result of re.search, or an empty default\n\n    >>> groups(r'(\\d)(\\d)(\\d)', '123')\n    ('1', '2', '3')\n    >>> groups(r'(\\d)(\\d)(\\d)', 'abc')\n    ('', '', '')\n    \"\"\"\n    m = re.search(regexp, s)\n    if m:\n        return m.groups()\n    return ('',) * num_of_groups(regexp)\n\n# Example usage\nfirst, last, phone = groups(r'(\\w+) (\\w+) ([\\d\\-]+)', 'John Doe 555-3456')\nprint(first, last, phone)  # Output: John Doe 555-3456\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the `num_of_groups` function:\n\n1. **Compile the Regular Expression**: `re.compile(regexp)` compiles the given regular expression into a pattern object.\n2. **Retrieve Number of Groups**: `pattern.groups` provides the number of capturing groups in the compiled pattern.\n\nThis function will work correctly with the `groups` function you've provided, allowing it to return the appropriate tuple of empty strings if no match is found."
