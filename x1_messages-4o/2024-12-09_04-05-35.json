The `list()` function takes an iterable, such as a string, and returns a list of its elements. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nstring = \"foobar\"\nchar_list = list(string)\nprint(char_list)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n['f', 'o', 'o', 'b', 'a', 'r']\n```\n\nThe `str.split()` method is used for splitting a string into a list based on a specified delimiter, which is why it didn't work for splitting the string into individual characters. Using `list()` is a straightforward way to achieve your desired result."
