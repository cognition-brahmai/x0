        "content": "Is it possible in Python to split a long function declaration across multiple lines? Our development team uses a PEP8 linter which requires a maximum line length of 80 characters. While writing unit tests in python, I prefer to have descriptive method names to describe what each test does, which often leads to exceeding the character limit. Here is an example of a function that is too long:\n\n```python\nclass ClientConnectionTest(unittest.TestCase):\n\n    def test_that_client_event_listener_receives_connection_refused_error_without_server(self):\n        self.given_server_is_offline()\n        self.given_client_connection()\n        self.when_client_connection_starts()\n        self.then_client_receives_connection_refused_error()\n```\n\nI have considered several options, including writing shorter method names, using multi-line comments, using a backslash for line continuation, stopping linting tests, increasing the line length limit, removing `test` from the start of methods, separating the EventListener into its own class, and using a BDD Framework like Behave. However, none of these options seem ideal.\n\nIs there a way to split a function name like this across multiple lines?\n\n```python\ndef test_that_client_event_listener_receives_\n  connection_refused_error_without_server(self):\n    self.given_server_is_offline()\n    self.given_client_connection()\n    self.when_client_connection_starts()\n    self.then_client_receives_connection_refused_error()\n```\n\nOr will I have to shorten the function name myself?"

        "content": "In Python, you cannot directly split a function name across multiple lines using line continuation techniques like backslashes or parentheses. However, there are still ways to adhere to PEP 8 guidelines while maintaining descriptive function names. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Use Underscores for Readability**: While you can't split a function name over multiple lines, using underscores can help maintain readability even if the line is long.\n\n2. **Descriptive Docstrings**: You can use a shorter name for the function and provide a detailed docstring that describes the test's purpose. This way, you keep the function name within the line length limit but still retain the descriptive nature of the test.\n\n   ```python\n   def test_connection_refused_error(self):\n       \"\"\"Test that the client event listener receives a connection refused error without a server.\"\"\"\n       self.given_server_is_offline()\n       self.given_client_connection()\n       self.when_client_connection_starts()\n       self.then_client_receives_connection_refused_error()\n   ```\n\n3. **Refactoring**: Consider breaking down the test function into smaller, more focused test functions. This might require some refactoring of your test setup but can lead to clearer, more maintainable tests.\n\n4. **Custom Linter Config**: While not ideal, you could configure the linter to ignore line length for test function names or specific files. This should be a last resort if none of the other options work for your team.\n\n5. **Use Comments**: While not splitting the function name, you can add comments above the function to provide additional context or description.\n\nRemember that while PEP 8 provides guidelines, they are not strict rules, and it's okay to make exceptions when it serves the clarity and maintainability of your code."
