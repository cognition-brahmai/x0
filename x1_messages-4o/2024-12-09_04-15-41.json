I have a python script that works well and I want it to send a message to a Telegram group chat when certain parameters reach some values. I think I can either use the Telegram APIs directly or use the Telegram's CLI. How can I implement this, especially if I opt for the second way, which I think is shorter? I tried using the script below, but it only sends the message without closing the process. I also don't know how to call this from python and pass the \"messagehere\" variable, which would be a 100/200 characters message defined within the python script.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\ncd /home/username/tg\necho \"msg user#******** messagehere\" | ./telegram\nsleep 10\necho \"quit\" | ./telegram\n```"

        "content": "To send a message to a Telegram group chat using Python 2.7 on Ubuntu, you can indeed use the Telegram CLI (Command Line Interface), which can be a straightforward approach. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you might implement this:\n\n### Step 1: Install Telegram CLI\n\nFirst, you need to install the Telegram CLI. You can clone it from its GitHub repository and build it:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install libreadline-dev libconfig-dev libssl-dev lua5.2 liblua5.2-dev libevent-dev\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/vysheng/tg.git\ncd tg\n./configure\nmake\n```\n\n### Step 2: Set Up Telegram CLI\n\nRun the Telegram CLI to set it up. You'll need to authorize your Telegram account by entering your phone number and the code you receive.\n\n```bash\nbin/telegram-cli -k tg-server.pub\n```\n\n### Step 3: Write the Bash Script\n\nYou can modify your bash script to include placeholders for dynamic messages. Here's an improved version:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\ncd /home/username/tg\necho \"msg $1 $2\" | ./bin/telegram-cli -k tg-server.pub -W\necho \"quit\" | ./bin/telegram-cli -k tg-server.pub -W\n```\n\nThis script takes two arguments: the username or group name and the message.\n\n### Step 4: Call the Bash Script from Python\n\nYou can call this bash script from your Python script using the `subprocess` module. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\ndef send_telegram_message(user, message):\n    # Define the path to your bash script\n    bash_script_path = \"/path/to/your/script.sh\"\n    \n    # Execute the bash script with the user and message as arguments\n    subprocess.call(['bash', bash_script_path, user, message])\n\n# Example usage\nuser = \"user#1234567\"  # Replace with the correct username or group name\nmessage = \"This is a test message from Python.\"\nsend_telegram_message(user, message)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Telegram CLI**: The Telegram CLI needs to be in a directory where it can access the configuration and authorization files it generated during setup.\n- **Bash Script**: The script now uses arguments to dynamically pass the username and message.\n- **Subprocess in Python**: The `subprocess.call()` function is used to call the bash script, passing the username and message as arguments.\n\n### Notes:\n\n- Ensure that the Telegram CLI is already authorized with your Telegram account.\n- Replace `/path/to/your/script.sh` with the actual path to your bash script.\n- Replace `user#1234567` with the actual identifier for the group or user you want to message.\n- The `-W` flag in the CLI command allows it to work in a non-interactive mode, which is useful for scripts.\n\nThis approach should allow you to send messages to a Telegram group from your Python script using the Telegram CLI."
