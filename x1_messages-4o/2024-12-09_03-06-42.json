I want the Flask server to start at the very beginning of my Python application, run throughout its entirety and then stop at the very end. But when I try to use a `threading.Thread`, I encounter an error with Werkzeug: `ValueError: signal only works in main thread`. How can I implement this without running Flask in the main thread?\n\nHere's the code I've been trying:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    \"\"\" My main application \"\"\"\n    from watcher.flask import app\n    # watcher.flask define an app as in the Quickstart flask documentation.\n    # See: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/quickstart/#quickstart\n\n    app.run() # Starting the flask application\n\n    do_my_stuff()\n\n    app.stop() # Undefined, for the idea \n```\n\nAnd here's the error message:\n\n```python\n * Running on http://0.0.0.0:10079/\nException in thread Flask Server:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/threading.py\", line 810, in __bootstrap_inner\n    self.run()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/threading.py\", line 763, in run\n    self.__target(*self.__args, **self.__kwargs)\n  File \".../develop-eggs/watcher.flask/src/watcher/flask/__init__.py\", line 14, in _run\n    app.run(host=HOSTNAME, port=PORT, debug=DEBUG)\n  File \".../eggs/Flask-0.10.1-py2.7.egg/flask/app.py\", line 772, in run\n    run_simple(host, port, self, **options)\n  File \".../eggs/Werkzeug-0.7-py2.7.egg/werkzeug/serving.py\", line 609, in run_simple\n    run_with_reloader(inner, extra_files, reloader_interval)\n  File \".../eggs/Werkzeug-0.7-py2.7.egg/werkzeug/serving.py\", line 524, in run_with_reloader\n    signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, lambda *args: sys.exit(0))\nValueError: signal only works in main thread\n```"

        "content": "To run a Flask application in a separate thread without encountering the `ValueError: signal only works in main thread`, you can use the `threading` module to start the Flask server on a different thread, but you'll need to ensure that the `use_reloader` option is set to `False` when running the Flask app. This will prevent Werkzeug's reloader from attempting to use signals, which must be handled in the main thread.\n\nHere's a revised version of your code that demonstrates how you can accomplish this:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\nimport threading\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef home():\n    return \"Hello, Flask!\"\n\ndef run_flask_app():\n    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=10079, debug=False, use_reloader=False)\n\ndef do_my_stuff():\n    # Your main application logic here\n    print(\"Doing my stuff...\")\n    # Simulate some work with sleep\n    import time\n    time.sleep(10)\n    print(\"Finished my stuff\")\n\ndef main():\n    # Start Flask in a separate thread\n    flask_thread = threading.Thread(target=run_flask_app)\n    flask_thread.start()\n\n    # Run your main application logic\n    do_my_stuff()\n\n    # Wait for the Flask server to finish (if necessary)\n    flask_thread.join()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **`use_reloader=False`**: This option is crucial to avoid the issue with the reloader trying to handle signals. This means that the server won't automatically restart if you change the code, so you'll need to restart it manually if you make changes to the Flask app.\n\n2. **Separate Thread**: The Flask application is started in a separate thread using Python's `threading.Thread`. This allows your `main()` function to continue executing and perform other tasks.\n\n3. **Thread Management**: You can use `flask_thread.join()` if you need to wait for the Flask server to finish before the application exits. This is often not necessary unless you have additional cleanup or shutdown logic that needs to occur after the server stops.\n\nWith this setup, your Flask application will run concurrently with your main application logic, and you can handle requests to the Flask server while performing other tasks in `do_my_stuff()`."
