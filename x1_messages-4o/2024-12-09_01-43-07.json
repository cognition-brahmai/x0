I've noticed that if my training set is of 1000 documents, around 800 are selected as support vectors. I am performing parameter selection and all the attributes in the feature vectors are ordered. I am using a linear kernel. Is there any correlation between the number of support vectors and the performance of the classifiers?"

        "content": "Yes, there is a correlation between the number of support vectors and the performance of SVM classifiers. In general, having a large number of support vectors as compared to the size of the training set can indicate that the model may not be generalizing well. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Model Complexity**: A high number of support vectors suggests that the decision boundary is complex and may be fitting the training data too closely. This can lead to overfitting, where the model captures noise in the training data rather than the underlying distribution.\n\n2. **Feature Space**: Since you're using a linear kernel, the separability of the data in the current feature space is crucial. If the data is not linearly separable, the model may struggle, leading to a high number of support vectors. Consider feature engineering or using a different kernel if the linear kernel is not capturing the complexity of your data.\n\n3. **Parameter Selection**: Ensure that proper parameter tuning is done. The regularization parameter \\( C \\) in SVM controls the trade-off between achieving a low training error and a low testing error. A very large \\( C \\) might lead to a lower training error but could increase the risk of overfitting.\n\n4. **Data Distribution**: Check for class imbalance or outliers in the dataset. Both can affect the number of support vectors and overall model performance. Techniques like resampling, SMOTE, or outlier detection can help mitigate these issues.\n\n5. **Dimensionality Reduction**: If the feature space is too large, consider dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA to reduce the number of features while maintaining important information.\n\n6. **Evaluation Metrics**: Ensure that you are using appropriate evaluation metrics to assess the performance of your classifier, especially in the case of imbalanced datasets.\n\nBy addressing these aspects, you may be able to improve the performance of your SVM classifier. If the linear kernel still doesn't provide satisfactory results, experimenting with other kernels like polynomial or RBF might be beneficial."
