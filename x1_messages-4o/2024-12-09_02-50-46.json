An example of its usage is shown below:\n\n```python\nwith open('/tmp/workfile', 'r') as f:\n    read_data = f.read()\nf.closed\n```\nThe above code indicates that after the \"with\" statement, the opened file is closed. Can you provide a detailed explanation of this?"

        "content": "The `with` keyword in Python is used to simplify exception handling by encapsulating common preparation and cleanup tasks in so-called context managers. It is often used for resource management, such as opening and closing files, where you want to ensure that the resource is properly acquired and released.\n\nWhen you use the `with` statement, the context manager defined by the object (in this case, the file object returned by `open`) takes care of setting up the resource and cleaning it up when the block of code is exited, regardless of whether the block is exited normally or via an exception. This helps prevent resource leaks, such as leaving a file open indefinitely.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how it works in your example:\n\n1. **Context Manager**: The `open` function returns a file object that acts as a context manager.\n\n2. **__enter__ Method**: When the `with` block is entered, the context manager's `__enter__` method is called. This method is responsible for setting up the resource. In the case of a file object, it opens the file and returns the file object itself.\n\n3. **Block Execution**: The block of code under the `with` statement is executed (in this case, reading data from the file).\n\n4. **__exit__ Method**: After the block of code is executed, the context manager's `__exit__` method is called. This method is responsible for cleaning up the resource. For a file object, this means closing the file.\n\nHere's the illustrative breakdown of your example:\n\n```python\nwith open('/tmp/workfile', 'r') as f:\n    read_data = f.read()  # The file is open within this block and can be read\n\n# After the block, the file is automatically closed by __exit__ method\nf.closed  # This will return True, indicating that the file is closed\n```\n\nBy using the `with` statement, you avoid the need to explicitly close the file with `f.close()`, and you ensure that the file is closed properly even if an error occurs within the block. This makes the code more robust and easier to read."
