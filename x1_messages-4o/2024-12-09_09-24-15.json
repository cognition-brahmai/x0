Here's an example query that demonstrates how to achieve this:\n\nAssuming you have a table named `products` with columns `category_id`, `price`, and `product_id`, your query might look like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    category_id,\n    AVG(price) AS average_price,\n    COUNT(product_id) AS total_products\nFROM \n    products\nGROUP BY \n    category_id;\n```\n\nThis query groups the results by `category_id`, calculates the average price of products in each category using `AVG(price)`, and counts the total number of products in each category using `COUNT(product_id)`. You can adjust the column names and table name as per your database schema."
