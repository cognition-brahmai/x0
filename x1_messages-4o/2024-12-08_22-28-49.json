Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```ruby\n# Define the numbers you want to add\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# Calculate the sum of these numbers\nsum = numbers.reduce(:+)\n\n# Output the result\nputs \"The sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 is #{sum}\"\n```\n\nWhen you run this Ruby script, it will output:\n\n```\nThe sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 is 15\n```\n\nHere's a brief explanation:\n\n- `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`: This line creates an array containing the numbers you want to sum.\n- `numbers.reduce(:+)`: This line uses the `reduce` method to sum up all the elements in the array. The `:+` is a symbol representing the addition operation.\n- `puts \"The sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 is #{sum}\"`: This line prints the result to the console.\n\nThis simple script effectively demonstrates that the sum of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 is 15."
