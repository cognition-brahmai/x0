If you're using Python 3, you won't see these 'u' prefixes as strings are Unicode by default.\n\nHowever, if you're working in Python 2 and you want to convert these Unicode strings to regular strings, you can do so using a dictionary comprehension. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n```python\n# Original dictionary with Unicode strings\noriginal_dict = {u'name': u'A', u'primary_key': 1}\n\n# Convert Unicode strings to regular strings\nconverted_dict = {str(key): str(value) if isinstance(value, unicode) else value for key, value in original_dict.items()}\n\nprint(converted_dict)\n```\n\nIn this code snippet:\n- We use a dictionary comprehension to iterate over the key-value pairs in the original dictionary.\n- We convert each key to a regular string using `str(key)`.\n- We check if the value is a Unicode string using `isinstance(value, unicode)`, and if so, convert it to a regular string with `str(value)`.\n- If the value is not a Unicode string (e.g., an integer or another data type), we leave it unchanged.\n\nIf you're using Python 3, you won't need to perform this conversion since the strings will already be in the desired format."
