For example, in the following code, what should replace the 'XXX' in the 'my_name()' method so that when I call 'my_name()' on the 'python' or 'cobra' classes, it prints out 'python' or 'cobra', respectively?\n\n```python\nclass snake():\n   @staticmethod\n   def my_name():  \n      print XXX.__name__\n\nclass python (snake):\n   pass\nclass cobra (snake):\n   pass\n\npython.my_name()\n# I want output to be python\n\ncobra.my_name()   \n# I want output to be cobra\n```"

        "content": "To achieve the desired behavior where the static method `my_name()` prints the name of the class it is called on, you can use the `cls` parameter in a `classmethod` instead of a `staticmethod`. This way, you have access to the class that the method was called on. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nclass snake:\n    @classmethod\n    def my_name(cls):  \n        print(cls.__name__)\n\nclass python(snake):\n    pass\n\nclass cobra(snake):\n    pass\n\npython.my_name()\n# This will output: python\n\ncobra.my_name()\n# This will output: cobra\n```\n\nBy changing `my_name()` to a class method using the `@classmethod` decorator and adding `cls` as a parameter, you ensure that the method knows which class it is being called on, allowing you to print the correct class name."
