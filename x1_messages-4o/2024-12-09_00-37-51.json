For instance, consider the following function:\n```python\ndef f(x):\n    \"\"\"Prints the element given as input\n\n    Args:\n        x: any element\n    Returns:\n    \"\"\"\n    print \"your input is %s\" % x\n    return\n```\nIn this case, what should be added after 'Returns:' in the docstring? Should it be left blank as it is now?"

        "content": "In Python docstrings, when a function does not return a value (i.e., it returns `None` implicitly or explicitly), it is common to indicate this explicitly in the `Returns:` section of the docstring. This helps to clarify the behavior of the function for anyone reading the documentation. \n\nYou can update the docstring as follows:\n\n```python\ndef f(x):\n    \"\"\"Prints the element given as input.\n\n    Args:\n        x: Any element.\n\n    Returns:\n        None\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"your input is %s\" % x)\n    return\n```\n\nBy indicating `None` under `Returns:`, you communicate clearly that this function is intended to perform an action (printing in this case) but does not provide any return value to the caller."
