However, I would like to specify a different directory for the extracted files to be stored in. I've written code to accomplish this, but it doesn't seem to be extracting the files to the intended directory. Here's the code I have so far:\n\n```python\nimport zipfile\n\nfh = open('test.zip', 'rb')\nz = zipfile.ZipFile(fh)\nfor name in z.namelist():\n    outfile = open(name, 'wb')\n    outfile.write('C:\\\\'+z.read(name))\n    outfile.close()\nfh.close()\n```\n\nHow can I modify it to extract files to a specific directory?"

        "content": "Your current code is attempting to write the contents of each file from the ZIP archive to a path that is constructed by simply prepending `'C:\\\\'` to the file content, which is incorrect. You need to specify the correct output path for each extracted file.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to extract the files to a specific directory:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport zipfile\n\n# Path to the directory where you want to extract the files\nextract_to = 'C:\\\\desired\\\\output\\\\directory'\n\n# Open the ZIP file\nwith open('test.zip', 'rb') as fh:\n    z = zipfile.ZipFile(fh)\n    for name in z.namelist():\n        # Construct full path for the output file\n        outfile_path = os.path.join(extract_to, name)\n        \n        # Create directories if they do not exist\n        if not os.path.exists(os.path.dirname(outfile_path)):\n            os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(outfile_path))\n\n        # Extract the file\n        with open(outfile_path, 'wb') as outfile:\n            outfile.write(z.read(name))\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n\n1. **Specify Output Directory**: Define the `extract_to` variable which holds the path to the directory where you want to extract the files.\n\n2. **Construct Full Path**: Use `os.path.join()` to construct the full path for each file that needs to be extracted.\n\n3. **Create Directories**: Ensure that the directories exist using `os.makedirs()`. This is important if the zip file contains nested directories.\n\n4. **Use Context Managers**: Use `with` statements for file handling to ensure the files are properly closed after processing.\n\nThis code will extract all files from `test.zip` into the specified directory, creating any necessary directories in the process."
