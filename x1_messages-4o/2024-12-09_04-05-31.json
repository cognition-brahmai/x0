I have a csv file with columns 'ID', 'Name', 'Address', 'City', 'State', 'Zip', 'Phone', 'OPEID', 'IPEDS', and I want to extract data only from the 'ID', 'Name', 'Zip' and 'Phone' columns. When I try to specify the columns by their indices and iterate through each row using row[2] for the 'Name' column, it doesn't seem to work as expected. Here's the code I've tried:\n\n```python\nimport sys, argparse, csv\nfrom settings import *\n\n# command arguments\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='csv to postgres',\\\n fromfile_prefix_chars=\"@\" )\nparser.add_argument('file', help='csv file to import', action='store')\nargs = parser.parse_args()\ncsv_file = args.file\n\n# open csv file\nwith open(csv_file, 'rb') as csvfile:\n\n    # get number of columns\n    for line in csvfile.readlines():\n        array = line.split(',')\n        first_item = array[0]\n\n    num_columns = len(array)\n    csvfile.seek(0)\n\n    reader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=' ')\n        included_cols = [1, 2, 6, 7]\n\n    for row in reader:\n            content = list(row[i] for i in included_cols)\n            print content\n```\n\nHowever, this code only seems to print out the last column for each row, not the specific columns I want."

        "content": "It seems you're encountering an issue because of how you're reading and splitting the CSV file. The problem arises from the way you're specifying the delimiter and handling the rows. Let's address these issues and adjust your code to correctly extract the specified columns ('ID', 'Name', 'Zip', and 'Phone') from the CSV file.\n\nHere's a revised version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport argparse\nimport csv\n\n# command arguments\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='csv to postgres', fromfile_prefix_chars=\"@\")\nparser.add_argument('file', help='csv file to import', action='store')\nargs = parser.parse_args()\ncsv_file = args.file\n\n# open csv file\nwith open(csv_file, 'r') as csvfile:\n    reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)\n\n    # Specify the columns you want to extract\n    included_cols = ['ID', 'Name', 'Zip', 'Phone']\n\n    for row in reader:\n        # Extract the data for the specified columns\n        content = {col: row[col] for col in included_cols}\n        print(content)\n```\n\n### Key Changes and Explanations:\n\n1. **Use `csv.DictReader`**: This allows you to read the CSV file as a dictionary, where each row is a dictionary with column headers as keys. This makes it easier to select specific columns by their names rather than indices.\n\n2. **Correct Delimiter**: Ensure that you're using the correct delimiter. The default delimiter for `csv.reader` and `csv.DictReader` is a comma, which is standard for CSV files. You don't need to specify the delimiter unless it's different.\n\n3. **Remove Redundant Code**: The previous approach involved manual splitting of lines, which is unnecessary when using the CSV module. The CSV reader handles this automatically.\n\n4. **Use `with open(..., 'r')`**: Open the file in text mode ('r') instead of binary mode ('rb') for compatibility with the CSV module.\n\nThis code will correctly extract and print the desired columns from each row of your CSV file. Make sure your CSV file's column names match exactly with those specified in `included_cols`."
