Differentiate \\( 3x^2 \\):\n   - The derivative of \\( x^n \\) is \\( nx^{n-1} \\).\n   - So, the derivative of \\( 3x^2 \\) is \\( 2 \\times 3x^{2-1} = 6x \\).\n\n2. Differentiate \\( 2x \\):\n   - The derivative of \\( x \\) is 1.\n   - So, the derivative of \\( 2x \\) is \\( 2 \\times 1 = 2 \\).\n\nNow, combine these results to get the derivative of the whole function:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = 6x + 2\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the derivative of the function \\( y = 3x^2 + 2x \\) is \\( 6x + 2 \\)."
