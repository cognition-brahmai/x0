        "content": "Certainly! Here's an enhanced version of the prompt:\n\n---\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nDevelop a JavaScript function that processes a given text to identify and handle homonyms appropriately. The function should be capable of distinguishing between words that share the same spelling but have different meanings based on context (homonyms). In addition to managing homonyms, the function should also replace synonyms to enhance the text's quality and variation.\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n1. **Homonym Handling:**\n   - The function must accurately identify homonyms in the text.\n   - It should use contextual clues to determine the correct meaning of each homonym.\n   - Provide examples in comments to illustrate how the context influences the identification of homonyms.\n\n2. **Synonym Replacement:**\n   - Implement a mechanism to replace words with suitable synonyms to add variety to the text.\n\n3. **Use of Libraries/APIs:**\n   - Specify whether the function should leverage an existing library or API for processing. If so, mention the library/API and provide integration instructions.\n   - If a pre-existing solution is not used, provide detailed instructions on constructing a custom thesaurus. This should include:\n     - Data structure suggestions for storing words, synonyms, and homonyms.\n     - Approaches for gathering contextual data to disambiguate homonyms.\n     - Sample data or references to datasets that can be used to build the thesaurus.\n\n4. **Implementation:**\n   - Write the JavaScript code for the function, including comments to explain the logic and any assumptions.\n   - Ensure the code is modular and can be easily extended or modified for additional features.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```javascript\n// Example function demonstrating handling homonyms and replacing synonyms\nfunction processText(text) {\n    // Initialize or integrate with a thesaurus (custom or library/API)\n    // Example: using a hypothetical library 'WordNetAPI'\n    // const thesaurus = new WordNetAPI();\n\n    // Split text into words and analyze each word\n    const words = text.split(' ');\n    const processedWords = words.map(word => {\n        // Detect and handle homonyms\n        const context = deriveContext(word, text);\n        const meaning = determineMeaning(word, context);\n        \n        // Replace with appropriate synonym\n        const synonym = findSynonym(meaning);\n        return synonym || word;\n    });\n\n    // Reconstruct and return the processed text\n    return processedWords.join(' ');\n}\n\n// Additional helper functions for context detection, meaning determination, etc.\n// function deriveContext(word, text) { /* Logic to derive context */ }\n// function determineMeaning(word, context) { /* Logic to determine meaning */ }\n// function findSynonym(meaning) { /* Logic to find synonym */ }\n```\n\nIncorporate these specifications into your implementation, ensuring the function is robust and efficient in handling both homonyms and synonyms.\n\n--- \n\nFeel free to modify and expand upon this prompt based on your specific requirements or constraints."
