How can I resolve this?"

        "content": "To pass variables from Flask to a JavaScript file, you need to ensure those variables are properly rendered as part of the HTML content that the browser receives, because Flask's templating engine (Jinja2) only processes templates within HTML files, not standalone JavaScript files. Here's how you can effectively pass and use these variables:\n\n### Method 1: Inline JavaScript in HTML\n\nOne common approach is to include JavaScript directly in your HTML file. You can embed your JavaScript code within `<script>` tags in `Settings.html`. For example:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Settings</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <!-- Your HTML content -->\n\n    <!-- Inline JavaScript to access Flask variables -->\n    <script>\n        var settings = {\n            channel: \"{{ project_name }}\",\n            publish_key: \"{{ publish_key }}\",\n            subscribe_key: \"{{ subscribe_key }}\"\n        };\n\n        // You can now use settings in your JavaScript code\n    </script>\n\n    <!-- You can also include your external JavaScript file after these variables are set -->\n    <script src=\"{{ url_for('static', filename='js/app.js') }}\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Method 2: Fetching Data via an AJAX Call\n\nAlternatively, you can use AJAX to fetch the data from a specific route and then use it in your external JavaScript file. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Create a Flask route to send the data as JSON**:\n\n    ```python\n    @app.route(\"/api/settings\")\n    def api_settings():\n        return {\n            \"project_name\": session.get('project_name'),\n            \"publish_key\": session.get('publish_key'),\n            \"subscribe_key\": session.get('subscribe_key')\n        }\n    ```\n\n2. **Fetch the data in your app.js file**:\n\n    ```javascript\n    fetch('/api/settings')\n        .then(response => response.json())\n        .then(data => {\n            var settings = {\n                channel: data.project_name,\n                publish_key: data.publish_key,\n                subscribe_key: data.subscribe_key\n            };\n\n            // Now you can use `settings` here\n            console.log(settings);\n        })\n        .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching settings:', error));\n    ```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Inline JavaScript in HTML**: By rendering the JavaScript inline within the HTML template, Flask's Jinja2 can substitute the variables directly. This is simple and effective for small scripts or when you need to ensure variables are available immediately.\n\n- **AJAX Call**: This method is cleaner for larger applications and when you want to separate concerns, maintaining your JavaScript logic in external files. It also provides flexibility in dynamically fetching data without reloading the page.\n\nChoose the method that best fits your application's architecture and your preferences for organizing code."
