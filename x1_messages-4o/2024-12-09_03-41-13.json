I would like to load it similarly to ActiveRecord but without having to run a database prior to executing my script. The issue is that I want to avoid any additional installations outside of the scripting language and its modules. Can anyone suggest which language and modules I should use for this task? Is it even feasible?"

        "content": "Yes, it is feasible to process CSV files using SQL-like queries in scripting languages without the need for a full database system. You can achieve this using Python with certain libraries that allow you to query data in memory. Below are some suggestions for Python and Ruby:\n\n### Python\n1. **Pandas**: Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library that allows you to load CSV files into DataFrames, which you can query using SQL-like syntax with the help of additional libraries.\n\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n\n   # Load CSV file into a DataFrame\n   df = pd.read_csv('your_file.csv')\n\n   # Perform SQL-like queries using Pandas syntax\n   result = df.query('column_name > value')\n   ```\n\n2. **Pandasql**: This library allows you to use SQL syntax directly on Pandas DataFrames.\n\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n   import pandasql as ps\n\n   # Load CSV file into a DataFrame\n   df = pd.read_csv('your_file.csv')\n\n   # Perform SQL queries\n   query = \"SELECT * FROM df WHERE column_name > value\"\n   result = ps.sqldf(query, locals())\n   ```\n\n3. **SQLite in-memory database**: You can use Python's built-in SQLite support to create an in-memory database, load data from CSV, and perform SQL queries.\n\n   ```python\n   import sqlite3\n   import pandas as pd\n\n   # Create an in-memory SQLite database\n   conn = sqlite3.connect(':memory:')\n   cursor = conn.cursor()\n\n   # Load CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame\n   df = pd.read_csv('your_file.csv')\n\n   # Write the DataFrame to the SQLite database\n   df.to_sql('your_table_name', conn, index=False, if_exists='replace')\n\n   # Perform SQL queries\n   query = \"SELECT * FROM your_table_name WHERE column_name > value\"\n   result = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)\n   ```\n\n### Ruby\n1. **CSV and SQLite3**: You can use Ruby's CSV library along with SQLite3 to achieve similar functionality.\n\n   ```ruby\n   require 'csv'\n   require 'sqlite3'\n\n   # Create an in-memory SQLite3 database\n   db = SQLite3::Database.new ':memory:'\n\n   # Load CSV file\n   csv_data = CSV.read('your_file.csv', headers: true)\n\n   # Create a table and import CSV data\n   db.execute \"CREATE TABLE your_table_name (column1 TEXT, column2 INTEGER)\"\n   csv_data.each do |row|\n     db.execute \"INSERT INTO your_table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (?, ?)\", row.fields\n   end\n\n   # Perform SQL queries\n   db.execute(\"SELECT * FROM your_table_name WHERE column2 > ?\", [value]) do |row|\n     puts row.join(\", \")\n   end\n   ```\n\nBoth Python and Ruby solutions do not require additional database installations and rely on standard libraries or easily installable modules. Choose the language you are more comfortable with or which better integrates into your existing workflow."
