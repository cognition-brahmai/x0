        "content": "When I use seaborn to plot heatmaps, or matplotlib to plot correlation matrices, I find that the first and the last row appear cut in half. This problem is demonstrated in the following code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndata = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/resbaz/r-novice-gapminder-files/master/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv')\nplt.figure(figsize=(10,5))\nsns.heatmap(data.corr())\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThe heatmap produced by this code has the first and last row cut in half, even though the labels on the y-axis appear correctly. A few days ago, this code worked as expected. The only change I have made since then is installing and then removing texlive-xetex. Any ideas on what is causing this issue and how I can fix it?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with the heatmap likely stems from the way `matplotlib` handles the layout of plots. Sometimes, the default settings for figure layout can cause parts of the plot to be clipped, especially when dealing with tight layouts or specific versions of libraries.\n\nHere are a few suggestions to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Adjust the Aspect Ratio**:\n   Ensure that the aspect ratio of your heatmap is appropriate. You can do this by setting the `aspect` parameter in `sns.heatmap`:\n   ```python\n   sns.heatmap(data.corr(), cmap='coolwarm', cbar_kws={'aspect': 30})\n   ```\n\n2. **Use `tight_layout()`**:\n   The `plt.tight_layout()` function can automatically adjust the subplot parameters to give specified padding. This might help in avoiding the cutting off of the first and last rows.\n   ```python\n   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\n   sns.heatmap(data.corr(), cmap='coolwarm')\n   plt.tight_layout()\n   plt.show()\n   ```\n\n3. **Adjust the Margins**:\n   Manually adjust the margins using `plt.subplots_adjust()` to give more space around the plot. For example:\n   ```python\n   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\n   sns.heatmap(data.corr(), cmap='coolwarm')\n   plt.subplots_adjust(top=0.9, bottom=0.1, left=0.15, right=0.95)\n   plt.show()\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for Updates**:\n   It's possible that changes in library versions could affect plot rendering. Make sure you have the latest versions of `matplotlib` and `seaborn` installed, as there might have been bug fixes or updates that address this issue.\n\n   You can update them using:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade matplotlib seaborn\n   ```\n\n5. **Test with Different Backends**:\n   Sometimes, the backend used by `matplotlib` can affect how plots are rendered. You can try switching to a different backend.\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib\n   matplotlib.use('TkAgg')  # or 'Agg', 'Qt5Agg', etc.\n   ```\n\nBy trying these solutions, you should be able to fix the issue with the heatmap rows being cut off. Let me know if you need further assistance!"
