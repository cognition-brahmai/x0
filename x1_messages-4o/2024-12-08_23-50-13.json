The company decides to divide the task among its 9 employees and assigns each of them a portion of the work to complete in a specific number of days. However, 2 of the employees become ill and are unable to work for the remaining time. The remaining employees step up and work extra hours each day to make up for the lost time. Eventually, they complete the task on time, and the company rewards them with a bonus.\nIf each of the 9 employees had the same amount of work to complete, how many days did each employee have to complete their portion of the task originally? How many days did each employee have to work after the 2 employees fell ill? If the company rewards the employees with a bonus of $900, how much does each employee receive if the bonus is divided equally among them?\nAs you consider this puzzle, pay attention to the themes of teamwork, determination, and hard work. These are all qualities that are important in achieving success in both personal and professional settings."

        "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Original Task Allocation:**\n\n   The task is supposed to be completed in 27 days, and it is divided equally among 9 employees. Therefore, each employee was originally assigned to complete their portion of the work in 27 days.\n\n2. **Impact of Ill Employees:**\n\n   After 2 employees become ill, there are 7 employees left to complete the same amount of work. The total work is still the same, but now it needs to be done by 7 employees instead of 9.\n\n3. **Revised Work Allocation:**\n\n   Since the total work remains the same, the remaining 7 employees will have to distribute the work of the 2 ill employees among themselves. Therefore, each of the 7 employees will now have to do \\(\\frac{9}{7}\\) of the work they were originally supposed to do.\n\n4. **Completion Time:**\n\n   To complete the task on time (i.e., in 27 days), the remaining 7 employees will need to work extra hours each day. Originally, each employee was working for 27 days to complete their portion. Now, they effectively have to work at a rate of \\(\\frac{9}{7}\\) times their original rate to finish in the same 27 days.\n\n5. **Bonus Distribution:**\n\n   The company rewards the hard-working employees with a bonus of $900. Since the 7 employees completed the task, the bonus is divided equally among them. Thus, each employee receives:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Bonus per employee} = \\frac{900}{7} \\approx 128.57\n   \\]\n\nSo, each of the 7 remaining employees worked at an increased pace but completed the task in the original 27 days, and each received approximately $128.57 as a bonus. This scenario highlights the importance of teamwork, determination, and hard work in achieving successful outcomes."
