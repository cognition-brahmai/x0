When I want to use this class in a dictionary, I have to add more boilerplate code to it. My question is, are there any popular Python idioms that can quickly derive data types with named accessors? If not, could an experienced Python developer perhaps demonstrate some metaclass hacking or class factory techniques to make this process simpler?\n\n```\nclass Pruefer:\n    def __init__(self, ident, maxNum=float('inf'), name=\"\"):\n        self.ident  = ident\n        self.maxNum = maxNum\n        self.name   = name\n\n    def __hash__(self):\n        return hash(self.ident, self.maxNum, self.name)\n```"

        "content": "Yes, there are several ways in Python to make the creation of simple data types with named accessors less boilerplate-heavy. One of the most popular idioms is using `dataclasses`, which were introduced in Python 3.7. They automatically generate special methods like `__init__`, `__repr__`, `__eq__`, and `__hash__` for you.\n\nHere's how you can use a `dataclass` to simplify your `Pruefer` class:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\n\n@dataclass\nclass Pruefer:\n    ident: any\n    maxNum: float = field(default=float('inf'))\n    name: str = field(default=\"\")\n```\n\nWith this `dataclass` implementation, you automatically get the `__init__`, `__repr__`, `__eq__`, and `__hash__` methods generated for you, and you have named accessors for the fields.\n\nIf you are using a version of Python before 3.7, you can use `namedtuple` from the `collections` module, but it doesn't support default values out of the box. However, you can work around this limitation by subclassing:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import namedtuple\n\nPrueferBase = namedtuple('PrueferBase', ['ident', 'maxNum', 'name'])\n\nclass Pruefer(PrueferBase):\n    def __new__(cls, ident, maxNum=float('inf'), name=\"\"):\n        return super(Pruefer, cls).__new__(cls, ident, maxNum, name)\n    \n    # If you want to override __hash__ or any other method, you can do it here\n```\n\nThis approach allows you to have named accessors and some level of customization with less boilerplate than a full class definition.\n\nFor more advanced use cases, you could explore metaclasses or factory functions, but for typical use cases, `dataclasses` or `namedtuple` should suffice."
