I have attempted to use the 'startswith' method as shown in the code below but it requires an argument. How can I modify this code to get all lines that do not start with a question mark?\n\n```python\nfor line in x:\n    header = line.startswith('?')\nif line.startswith() != header:\n        # DO SOME STUFF HERE\n```"

Here's a modified version of your code:\n\n```python\nfor line in x:\n    if not line.startswith('?'):\n        # DO SOME STUFF HERE\n```\n\nThis code iterates over each line in your text file (or list of lines `x`). For each line, it checks if the line does not start with a question mark (`?`). If the condition is true, it proceeds to perform the desired manipulations on those lines. This approach is both simple and efficient for processing a large number of lines."
