        "content": "To create a dynamic feature for your HTML comic strip page that allows users to interact with each panel and reveal hidden Easter eggs, you can use JavaScript to handle the interaction. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n1. **HTML Structure:**\n   Use `div` elements instead of `panel` since `panel` is not a standard HTML element. Here's how you can structure your HTML:\n\n   ```html\n   <div class=\"panel\" id=\"1\">\n     <img src=\"panel1.png\" alt=\"Panel 1\">\n     <div class=\"easter-egg hidden\">\n       <p>Did you know that the phone in this panel is actually based on the first ever mobile phone invented in 1973?</p>\n     </div>\n   </div>\n   <div class=\"panel\" id=\"2\">\n     <img src=\"panel2.png\" alt=\"Panel 2\">\n     <div class=\"easter-egg hidden\">\n       <p>Here's a fun fact: the phone in this panel is actually a nod to the iconic Nokia 3310, known for its durability and long battery life.</p>\n     </div>\n   </div>\n   <div class=\"panel\" id=\"3\">\n     <img src=\"panel3.png\" alt=\"Panel 3\">\n     <div class=\"easter-egg hidden\">\n       <p>Check out the phone in this panel - it's modeled after the iPhone 11, which was released in 2019.</p>\n     </div>\n   </div>\n   ```\n\n2. **CSS to Hide Easter Eggs:**\n\n   You'll need some basic CSS to hide the Easter eggs initially:\n\n   ```css\n   .hidden {\n     display: none;\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **JavaScript for Interactivity:**\n\n   Add JavaScript to handle the click events and toggle the visibility of the Easter eggs:\n\n   ```html\n   <script>\n     document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\n       const panels = document.querySelectorAll('.panel');\n\n       panels.forEach(panel => {\n         panel.addEventListener('click', function() {\n           const easterEgg = this.querySelector('.easter-egg');\n           easterEgg.classList.toggle('hidden');\n         });\n       });\n     });\n   </script>\n   ```\n\n   - This script first waits for the DOM to load.\n   - Then, it selects all elements with the class `panel`.\n   - For each `panel`, it adds a click event listener.\n   - When a panel is clicked, it finds the `.easter-egg` element within that panel and toggles the `hidden` class.\n\n4. **Integrating into Your Page:**\n\n   Ensure that your JavaScript and CSS are properly linked in your HTML file. Place the CSS in a `<style>` tag within the `<head>` section or in a separate CSS file, and include the JavaScript at the end of your `<body>` tag or in a separate JS file that's linked at the end of your HTML body.\n\nThis setup will allow users to click on each panel image and reveal the hidden Easter egg related to the phone-buying journey, providing an interactive experience."
