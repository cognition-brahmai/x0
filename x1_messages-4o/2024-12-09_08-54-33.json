        "content": "To find the total number of possible binary strings of a given length \\( n \\), you can use a straightforward combinatorial property. A binary string is a sequence consisting only of the digits 0 and 1. For each position in the string, you have two choices: either a 0 or a 1. \n\nHere's the simple algorithm:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: You have a binary string of length \\( n \\).\n2. **Choices Per Position**: At each position in the string, you can choose either 0 or 1. Therefore, for each position, there are 2 possible choices.\n3. **Calculate Total Combinations**: Since the choices are independent for each of the \\( n \\) positions, you multiply the number of choices for each position. This gives you \\( 2 \\times 2 \\times \\ldots \\times 2 \\) (n times), which is \\( 2^n \\).\n4. **Result**: The total number of possible binary strings of length \\( n \\) is \\( 2^n \\).\n\nSo, if you want to find the number of binary strings of length \\( n \\), simply calculate \\( 2^n \\). For example, if \\( n = 3 \\), the total number of binary strings is \\( 2^3 = 8 \\). The strings are: 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, and 111."
