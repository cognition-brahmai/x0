I'm not interested in graphical representations, but would like to understand the output object once a set of words are turned into tries or DAWGs."

        "content": "Creating a Trie and a Directed Acyclic Word Graph (DAWG) in Python involves constructing a data structure that efficiently stores and retrieves strings, particularly useful for applications like autocomplete or spell-checking. Here's a step-by-step guide to implementing both, including handling multi-word blocks and linking prefixes/suffixes in a DAWG.\n\n### Trie Implementation\n\nA Trie is a tree-like data structure where each node represents a character of a word. Here's a basic implementation:\n\n```python\nclass TrieNode:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.children = {}\n        self.is_end_of_word = False\n\nclass Trie:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.root = TrieNode()\n\n    def insert(self, word):\n        current_node = self.root\n        for char in word:\n            if char not in current_node.children:\n                current_node.children[char] = TrieNode()\n            current_node = current_node.children[char]\n        current_node.is_end_of_word = True\n\n    def search(self, word):\n        current_node = self.root\n        for char in word:\n            if char not in current_node.children:\n                return False\n            current_node = current_node.children[char]\n        return current_node.is_end_of_word\n```\n\n### Handling Multi-word Blocks\n\nIf you want to handle multi-word blocks where words are separated by spaces or hyphens, treat these separators as characters.\n\n```python\ntrie = Trie()\ntrie.insert(\"word-block\")\ntrie.insert(\"multi word phrase\")\n```\n\n### DAWG Implementation\n\nA DAWG is a more space-efficient version of a Trie, which merges common suffixes. Implementing a full DAWG from scratch is complex, but here's a simplified approach:\n\n```python\nclass DAWGNode:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.children = {}\n        self.is_end_of_word = False\n\nclass DAWG:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.root = DAWGNode()\n        self.minimized_nodes = {}\n\n    def insert(self, word):\n        current_node = self.root\n        for char in word:\n            if char not in current_node.children:\n                current_node.children[char] = DAWGNode()\n            current_node = current_node.children[char]\n        current_node.is_end_of_word = True\n\n    def minimize(self):\n        # Minimize nodes to merge common suffixes\n        self._minimize(self.root)\n\n    def _minimize(self, node):\n        for char, child in list(node.children.items()):\n            self._minimize(child)\n            child_signature = (char, child.is_end_of_word, frozenset(child.children.items()))\n            if child_signature in self.minimized_nodes:\n                node.children[char] = self.minimized_nodes[child_signature]\n            else:\n                self.minimized_nodes[child_signature] = child\n\n    def search(self, word):\n        current_node = self.root\n        for char in word:\n            if char not in current_node.children:\n                return False\n            current_node = current_node.children[char]\n        return current_node.is_end_of_word\n```\n\n### Linking Prefix/Suffix\n\nIn DAWG, common prefixes and suffixes are inherently shared due to node minimization. If you need explicit links, you can extend nodes with metadata for tracking such relationships.\n\n### Output Structure for Large Datasets\n\nFor 100k to 500k entries, you should focus on efficient memory usage. The Trie or DAWG will consist of nodes with character keys and child node references. Here's a conceptual representation:\n\n```plaintext\n{\n    'w': {\n        'o': {\n            'r': {\n                'd': {'-': {'b': {'l': {'o': {'c': {'k': {}}}}}}},\n                'd': {'-': {'b': {'l': {'o': {'c': {'k': {}}}}}}}\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    'm': {\n        'u': {\n            'l': {\n                't': {\n                    'i': {' ': {'w': {'o': {'r': {'d': {' ': {'p': {'h': {'r': {'a': {'s': {'e': {}}}}}}}}}}}}}}\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Optimization Tips\n\n- Use libraries like `pygtrie` for Trie or `DAWG-Python` for DAWG that provide optimized implementations.\n- Consider using compressed representations for large datasets.\n- Use persistent storage like databases if memory usage becomes a concern.\n\nThis setup should help you handle large datasets while efficiently storing and retrieving words or phrases."
