        "content": "As a beginner in Python testing, I often see tests where an external dependency is replaced with a local method. For instance, in the following code:\n```python\nimport some_module\n\ndef get_file_data():\n  return \"here is the pretend file data\"\n\nsome_module.get_file_data = get_file_data\n\n# proceed to test\n```\nThis is often referred to as \"monkey patching\" as mentioned in this [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5626193/what-is-a-monkey-patch). However, I have also come across the term \"mocking\" being used in similar contexts. Are there any differences between the concepts of \"mocking\" and \"monkey patching\"?"

As in your example, it means directly replacing or modifying existing code in a module to change its behavior temporarily during the runtime of a program.\n   - It's often used to replace functions or methods with custom implementations for testing or to modify third-party libraries without altering their source code.\n   - This approach can be risky if not handled carefully because it changes the original behavior of the code, which could lead to unexpected side effects, especially in a larger codebase.\n\n2. **Mocking**:\n   - Mocking is a testing technique where you create objects that simulate the behavior of real objects. These mock objects are used to test the behavior of other objects that interact with them.\n   - In Python, the `unittest.mock` module provides tools for creating mocks and setting expectations on how they should be used during tests.\n   - Mocking is more structured and managed compared to monkey patching. It allows you to specify the behavior of a mock object, such as what it should return when called, and to assert that it was used correctly in your tests.\n\nIn summary, while both techniques involve altering or simulating behavior for testing purposes, mocking is a more formal and controlled approach, often using specialized libraries or frameworks. Monkey patching, on the other hand, is a more direct and potentially riskier way to change behavior by directly modifying code. In practice, using mocking frameworks like `unittest.mock` is generally preferred for its safety and clarity."
