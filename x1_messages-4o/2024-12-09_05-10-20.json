        "content": "To configure TextMate to use Python 3.1 instead of the built-in version, you need to adjust the PATH or specify the Python interpreter directly in TextMate. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Modify the PATH in TextMate:**\n\n   - Open TextMate and go to `Preferences` (TextMate > Preferences).\n   - Navigate to the `Variables` tab.\n   - Look for the `PATH` variable. If it exists, you can edit it to include the path to your Python 3.1 installation. If it doesn\u2019t exist, you can create it.\n   - Add the directory containing your Python 3.1 executable to the PATH. It might look something like `/usr/local/bin` or wherever your Python 3.1 is installed.\n   - Make sure the path to Python 3.1 comes before any other Python paths to ensure that TextMate uses it first.\n\n2. **Specify the Python Interpreter in the Script:**\n\n   - When running a Python script, you can specify the interpreter at the top of your script by adding a shebang line. Modify the first line of your Python script to point to the Python 3.1 interpreter. For example:\n\n     ```python\n     #!/usr/bin/env python3.1\n     ```\n\n   - Ensure that this line is the first line in your script and that the script file has execute permissions.\n\n3. **Check the Bundle Settings:**\n\n   - TextMate uses bundles to manage language-specific settings and commands. Open the Bundle Editor (Bundles > Bundle Editor > Show Bundle Editor).\n   - Locate the Python bundle and check the commands that run the scripts. Ensure they are set to use `/usr/bin/env python3.1` or the path to your Python 3.1 installation.\n\nAfter making these changes, try running your Python script in TextMate again. It should now use Python 3.1. If you continue to have issues, double-check the paths and ensure that your Python 3.1 installation is correctly installed and accessible from the command line."
