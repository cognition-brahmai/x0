Here is the code I am using:\n\n```python\noutputFile = open(\"./outputFile.txt\",\"a\")\noutputFile.write(\"First\")\nprint \"Now you have 10sec to see that outputFile.txt is still the same as before\"\ntime.sleep(10)\noutputFile.write(\"Second\")\nprint \"Now if you look at outputFile.txt you will see 'First' and 'Second'\"\n```\n\nDuring the sleep time of 10 seconds, I noticed that the outputFile.txt is still the same as before. After the sleep time, when I check outputFile.txt, I can see both 'First' and 'Second'. How can I make Python instantly write to the output file?"

        "content": "In Python 2.7, file writes are buffered, which means that the data is not immediately written to the disk. Instead, it's stored in a buffer and written in chunks for efficiency. To ensure that data is written to the file immediately, you need to flush the buffer after each write operation. You can do this using the `flush()` method on the file object.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to flush the buffer after each write:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\noutputFile = open(\"./outputFile.txt\", \"a\")\noutputFile.write(\"First\")\noutputFile.flush()  # Flush the buffer to ensure \"First\" is written to the file\nprint \"Now you have 10sec to see that outputFile.txt is still the same as before\"\ntime.sleep(10)\noutputFile.write(\"Second\")\noutputFile.flush()  # Flush again to ensure \"Second\" is written to the file\nprint \"Now if you look at outputFile.txt you will see 'First' and 'Second'\"\n```\n\nAdditionally, you can use the `with` statement to handle file operations, which ensures that the file is properly closed and flushed when you're done:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\nwith open(\"./outputFile.txt\", \"a\") as outputFile:\n    outputFile.write(\"First\")\n    outputFile.flush()\n    print \"Now you have 10sec to see that outputFile.txt is still the same as before\"\n    time.sleep(10)\n    outputFile.write(\"Second\")\n    outputFile.flush()\n    print \"Now if you look at outputFile.txt you will see 'First' and 'Second'\"\n```\n\nUsing `flush()` ensures that your data is written to the disk immediately, and using `with` ensures proper resource management."
