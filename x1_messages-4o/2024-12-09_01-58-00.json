Here's how you can use it:\n\n```bash\nwhoami\n```\n\nWhen you run this command in your terminal, it will output the username of the user currently logged into the session.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the `id` command with the `-un` option to achieve the same result:\n\n```bash\nid -un\n```\n\nBoth commands will give you the username of the current user running the script or command."
