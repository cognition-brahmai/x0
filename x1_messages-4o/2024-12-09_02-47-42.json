For instance, when I import the 'csv' module in Python2 and Python3, I get different results. In Python2:\n```python\npython2 -c 'import csv; print(csv)'\n<module 'csv' from '/usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.13/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/csv.pyc'>\n```\nAfter creating a new 'csv.py' file:\n```python\n$ touch csv.py\n$ python2 -c 'import csv; print(csv)'\n<module 'csv' from 'csv.pyc'>\n```\nIn Python3, it still searches from the current package:\n```python\n$ python3 -c 'import csv; print(csv)'\n<module 'csv' from '/path_to/csv.py'>\n```\nWhy is this the case?"

        "content": "In Python, imports are used to bring modules into the namespace of your script so you can use their functionality. There are two types of imports: absolute and relative. \n\n### Implicit Relative Imports\n\nImplicit relative imports occur when a module within a package imports another module from the same package using just the module's name, without specifying the full path or using the explicit relative import syntax. This was a common practice in Python 2, where the import statement would first search for the module in the current package before looking in the global namespace.\n\nFor example, if you had a package structure like this:\n\n```\nmypackage/\n    __init__.py\n    module_a.py\n    module_b.py\n```\n\nAnd `module_a.py` had a line like this:\n\n```python\nimport module_b\n```\n\nPython 2 would interpret this as an implicit relative import, looking for `module_b` within the `mypackage` directory.\n\n### Why Removed in Python 3?\n\nPython 3 removed implicit relative imports for several reasons:\n\n1. **Clarity and Readability:** Implicit relative imports can be ambiguous and make it unclear where the module is being imported from, especially in larger projects. This can lead to maintenance challenges and bugs that are hard to track down.\n\n2. **Namespace Confusion:** Implicit relative imports could lead to conflicts with modules with the same name in the global namespace, causing unexpected behavior.\n\n3. **Explicit is Better Than Implicit:** This is one of the guiding principles of Python (as per the Zen of Python). By making imports explicit, it's clear to anyone reading the code exactly where each module is coming from.\n\n### PEP 8 Guidelines\n\nPEP 8 is the style guide for Python code, and it recommends against using implicit relative imports for the same reasons that Python 3 removed them. Instead, you should use absolute imports or explicit relative imports (using dots to signify the current and parent packages).\n\n### Example in Python 3\n\nIn Python 3, if you want to perform a relative import, you need to be explicit about it:\n\n```python\nfrom . import module_b  # Import module_b from the same package\n```\n\n### CSV Module Example\n\nThe differences you observed in your CSV module example highlight potential pitfalls of implicit relative imports:\n\n- In Python 2, when you created a `csv.py` file in the current directory, the interpreter used it instead of the standard library's CSV module because it prioritized the local file due to implicit relative import behavior.\n  \n- In Python 3, the import system is designed to be more explicit, but your `csv.py` file was still used because the interpreter found it first on the module search path (current directory is typically included in `sys.path`).\n\nTo avoid such conflicts, you should ensure that your local files do not have the same names as standard library modules, and use explicit import statements. For instance, use:\n\n```python\nimport csv  # This will import the standard library 'csv' module\n```\n\nAnd avoid naming local files `csv.py` to prevent shadowing."
