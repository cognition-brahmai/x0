My code is as follows:\n\n```python\nfaces = cv.HaarDetectObjects(grayscale, cascade, storage, 1.2, 2,\ncv.CV_HAAR_DO_CANNY_PRUNING, (50,50))\n\n   for f in faces:\n       print(f)\n```\nThe output is a list of detections in the form:\n\n```\n ((174, 54, 114, 114), 53)\n ((22, 51, 121, 121), 36)\n ((321, 56, 114, 114), 21)\n ((173, 263, 125, 125), 51)\n ((323, 272, 114, 114), 20)\n ((26, 271, 121, 121), 36)\n```\n\nEach line represents a detection. The first 4 numbers are the x,y location of the top-left point, and the height, width of the bounding box. The last number is, according to openCV documentation, the number of neighbors. I'm unclear about what the last number means as I have been unable to find any reference to that. Also, is there a way to get a confidence score for each detection? I would like to know how confident the face classifier is that the detection corresponds to a real face."

        "content": "The output you are getting from `cv.HaarDetectObjects` is a list of detections, where each detection consists of a tuple. The tuple contains two elements: the bounding box and the number of neighbors.\n\n### Explanation of the Output:\n\n1. **Bounding Box (x, y, width, height):** \n   - This tuple `(x, y, width, height)` specifies the top-left corner of the bounding box `(x, y)`, and the `width` and `height` of the bounding box that potentially contains a face.\n\n2. **Number of Neighbors:**\n   - The last number in each detection tuple represents the number of neighboring rectangles that were found by the detector. In the context of face detection with Haar cascades, this number indicates how many rectangles are found and grouped together to form a single detection. A higher number generally indicates a higher confidence that the detection is indeed a face, as it implies more overlapping detections at that location.\n\n### Confidence Score:\n\nUnfortunately, the Haar cascade classifier in OpenCV does not provide a direct confidence score for each detection. The number of neighbors is often used as a proxy for confidence, with higher numbers suggesting more reliable detections, but it is not a probabilistic confidence score.\n\nIf you need a more robust measure of confidence, you might consider using a deep learning-based face detection method such as:\n- **Dlib's CNN face detector** - Provides confidence scores.\n- **MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks)** - Provides probability scores for detections.\n- **OpenCV's DNN module** - Supports various pre-trained models like Caffe, TensorFlow, etc.\n\nUsing these methods, you can obtain more reliable confidence scores for each detection, allowing you to better filter and analyze your results."
