        "content": "Certainly! To replace nouns with pronouns using the NLTK library in Python, we'll need to perform several steps. We'll use tokenization and part-of-speech tagging to identify nouns, and then replace them with appropriate pronouns. Here's a simple demonstration:\n\n```python\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk import pos_tag, word_tokenize\nfrom nltk.corpus import wordnet as wn\n\n# Download necessary NLTK data files\nnltk.download('punkt')\nnltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')\nnltk.download('wordnet')\n\n# Function to determine the gender of a noun (simple heuristic)\ndef get_pronoun(word):\n    # Normally, we might use a more advanced method or database for gender detection\n    # Here, we use a simple heuristic based on WordNet\n    synsets = wn.synsets(word)\n    if not synsets:\n        return 'it'  # Default to 'it' if we can't find the word in WordNet\n\n    # Check if the word is a person\n    for synset in synsets:\n        if 'person' in synset.lexname():\n            return 'he' if word.lower() in ['marcus', 'john', 'michael'] else 'she'\n\n    return 'it'\n\ndef replace_nouns_with_pronouns(sentence):\n    # Tokenize and POS tag the sentence\n    tokens = word_tokenize(sentence)\n    pos_tags = pos_tag(tokens)\n\n    # Replace nouns with pronouns\n    new_sentence = []\n    for word, pos in pos_tags:\n        if pos.startswith('NN'):  # Check if it's a noun\n            pronoun = get_pronoun(word)\n            new_sentence.append(pronoun)\n        else:\n            new_sentence.append(word)\n\n    return ' '.join(new_sentence)\n\n# Example sentence\nsentence = \"Marcus was walking down the street\"\nnew_sentence = replace_nouns_with_pronouns(sentence)\nprint(new_sentence)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Tokenization and POS Tagging**: We tokenize the input sentence and then use part-of-speech tagging to identify the nouns.\n2. **Gender Determination**: We use a simple heuristic to determine the pronoun. Here, I've hard-coded a few names for demonstration. In practice, you might use a more sophisticated method.\n3. **Replacement**: We loop through each token, replacing nouns with the corresponding pronouns.\n4. **Output**: The final sentence with nouns replaced by pronouns is constructed and printed.\n\nThis code is quite basic and uses heuristics for gender determination. In a real-world application, you might need to integrate a more sophisticated gender detection system or database."
