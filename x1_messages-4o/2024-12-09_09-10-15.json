        "content": "Your code for obtaining the elements of a 2D matrix in spiral order is concise and efficient. Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n\n1. **Initialize Result List**: Start with an empty list `result` to store the elements in spiral order.\n\n2. **Iterate While Matrix is Not Empty**: Continue the process until `matrix` becomes empty.\n\n3. **Add First Row**: Take the first row of the matrix and append it to `result`.\n\n4. **Transform the Remaining Matrix**:\n   - Use `zip(*matrix[1:])` to transpose the remaining sub-matrix (excluding the first row).\n   - Reverse the transposed sub-matrix using `[::-1]` to effectively simulate a 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n\n5. **Return Result**: After the matrix is fully traversed, return the `result` list containing elements in spiral order.\n\nHere's your code with some additional comments for clarity:\n\n```python\ndef spiral_matrix(matrix):\n    result = []\n    while matrix:\n        result += matrix[0]  # Add the first row to the result\n        # Transform the remaining matrix: transpose and reverse\n        matrix = list(zip(*matrix[1:]))[::-1]  \n    return result\n\n# Example usage\nprint(spiral_matrix([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]\n```\n\nThis implementation efficiently reduces the matrix and extracts the elements in spiral order by continuously removing the outermost layer. It handles rectangular matrices as well, not just square ones."
