Additionally, the updated code should generate a novel sentence conveying the same sentiment as \"I am feeling thrilled\", while also ensuring that the selected word has not appeared in the previous 5 sentences. Furthermore, the new algorithm must incorporate a feature that identifies whether the chosen vocabulary word is a synonym of any previously used words within the document, and in such cases, selects a different word from the list of available options. The list of available vocabulary words comprises of ecstatic, elated, jubilant, euphoric, and exuberant. Can you integrate these functionalities while keeping the code succinct and efficient?"

        "content": "To enhance the existing Ruby code with the specified functionalities, I'll provide a solution that incorporates an advanced algorithm for selecting vocabulary words while ensuring the requirements are met. Here's the updated code:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'set'\n\nclass VocabularySelector\n  attr_accessor :words, :previous_words\n\n  def initialize(words)\n    @words = words\n    @previous_words = []\n    @synonyms_map = build_synonyms_map(words)\n  end\n\n  def build_synonyms_map(words)\n    synonyms = {\n      'ecstatic' => ['elated', 'jubilant', 'euphoric', 'exuberant'],\n      'elated' => ['ecstatic', 'jubilant', 'euphoric', 'exuberant'],\n      'jubilant' => ['ecstatic', 'elated', 'euphoric', 'exuberant'],\n      'euphoric' => ['ecstatic', 'elated', 'jubilant', 'exuberant'],\n      'exuberant' => ['ecstatic', 'elated', 'jubilant', 'euphoric']\n    }\n    synonyms.default = []\n    synonyms\n  end\n\n  def select_word\n    available_words = @words - @previous_words.last(5)\n    \n    available_words.each do |word|\n      if (@previous_words & @synonyms_map[word]).empty?\n        @previous_words << word\n        return word\n      end\n    end\n\n    # If no suitable word is found, select any available word\n    word = available_words.sample\n    @previous_words << word\n    word\n  end\n\n  def generate_sentence\n    word = select_word\n    \"I am feeling #{word}\"\n  end\nend\n\nvocab_words = ['ecstatic', 'elated', 'jubilant', 'euphoric', 'exuberant']\nselector = VocabularySelector.new(vocab_words)\n\n10.times do\n  puts selector.generate_sentence\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **VocabularySelector Class:** This class manages the selection of vocabulary words and tracks previously used words.\n\n2. **Synonyms Map:** A hash map is used to store synonyms for each word, which helps in ensuring that synonyms of previously used words are not selected.\n\n3. **Word Selection Algorithm:**\n   - The `select_word` method filters out words that appeared in the last 5 sentences.\n   - It checks if the word or any of its synonyms have been used recently and selects a different word if necessary.\n   - If no suitable word is found within constraints, it randomly selects from the available options.\n\n4. **Sentence Generation:** The `generate_sentence` method constructs a sentence using the selected word while maintaining the sentiment of \"I am feeling thrilled\".\n\nThis implementation ensures efficient word selection while ensuring that constraints regarding recent usage and synonyms are respected."
