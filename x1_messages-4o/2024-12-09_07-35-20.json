I have a model that relies on a tuple and I would like to specify \"default=0\" as something more readable, thus eliminating the need for a comment. Is there a way to avoid using a number altogether and use the string 'Requires attention' instead?\n\nHere's a sample of my code:\n\n```python\nStatus = (\n    (-1, 'Cancelled'),\n    (0, 'Requires attention'),\n    (1, 'Work in progress'),\n    (2, 'Complete'),\n)\n\nclass Task(models.Model):\n    status = models.IntegerField(choices=Status, default=0) # Status is 'Requires attention' (0) by default.\n```"

        "content": "To improve readability and avoid using numbers directly when referring to constants in tuples like your `Status` tuple, you can use Python's `enum` module. The `enum` module allows you to define readable names for your constants and use those names throughout your code instead of using raw numbers. This is particularly useful in Django models for setting default values and making the code more maintainable.\n\nHere's how you can refactor your code to use `enum`:\n\n```python\nfrom enum import IntEnum\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass Status(IntEnum):\n    CANCELLED = -1\n    REQUIRES_ATTENTION = 0\n    WORK_IN_PROGRESS = 1\n    COMPLETE = 2\n\n    @classmethod\n    def choices(cls):\n        return [(status.value, status.name.replace('_', ' ').title()) for status in cls]\n\nclass Task(models.Model):\n    status = models.IntegerField(choices=Status.choices(), default=Status.REQUIRES_ATTENTION.value)\n\n# Usage\ntask = Task()\nprint(task.status)  # This will output 0, which corresponds to 'Requires attention'\n```\n\n### Benefits of using `enum`:\n\n1. **Readability:** You can use `Status.REQUIRES_ATTENTION` instead of `0`, making your code more understandable.\n2. **Maintainability:** If you need to change the underlying value of a status, you only need to update it in the `enum` definition.\n3. **Consistency:** Enums help ensure that only valid values are used throughout your codebase.\n\nIn this setup, the `Status` enum class defines the possible states with meaningful names. The `choices` method dynamically generates the choices for the Django model field. This way, you can refer to the status using `Status.REQUIRES_ATTENTION`, and it will automatically convert to the appropriate integer value when used as a default or in comparisons."
