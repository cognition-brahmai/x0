Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Open Anaconda Prompt**: Start by opening your Anaconda Prompt or terminal where you have Anaconda set up.\n\n2. **Uninstall PyTorch and its dependencies**: Use the following command to remove PyTorch, torchvision, and any other dependencies that were installed with them:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda remove pytorch torchvision\n   ```\n\n   This command will prompt you to confirm the removal of the specified packages and their dependencies. Review the list and confirm the action.\n\n3. **Clean up unused packages**: After removing the packages, you can clean up any remaining unused packages and cached files by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda clean --all\n   ```\n\n   This will help free up space and ensure that no unnecessary files are left behind.\n\n4. **Verify the uninstallation**: To double-check that PyTorch and its dependencies have been removed, you can list the installed packages with:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda list\n   ```\n\n   Look through the list to ensure PyTorch and torchvision are no longer present.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully uninstall PyTorch and its associated dependencies from your Anaconda environment."
