I am currently trying to execute the following query:\n\n```python\nresult = connection.execute(\n    \"select id_number from Table where string like '_stringStart%' limit 1;\"\n)\n```\n\nHowever, I receive the following error: \n\n```python\nquery = query % escaped_args\nTypeError: not enough arguments for format string\n```\n\nI have tried using '%%' instead of '%' as suggested in some online resources, but it did not solve the issue. Is there a method to escape the '%' character, or alternatively, is there another way to construct a query that searches for a string that starts with a random letter followed by a particular sequence?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to Python's string interpolation, where the `%` symbol is used to format strings. In your SQLAlchemy query, the `%` character is being interpreted as a placeholder for string formatting, which is why you're running into a `TypeError`.\n\nTo properly escape the `%` character in a SQLAlchemy query using PyMySQL, you should use parameterized queries. This approach not only solves the issue with the `%` character but also helps prevent SQL injection attacks. Here's how you can modify your query:\n\n```python\nresult = connection.execute(\n    \"SELECT id_number FROM Table WHERE string LIKE %s LIMIT 1;\", \n    ('_stringStart%',)\n)\n```\n\nIn this example, `%s` is a placeholder for the parameterized value, and `('_stringStart%',)` is a tuple containing the value to be inserted into the query. By passing the parameter this way, SQLAlchemy and PyMySQL will handle the escaping for you.\n\nThis approach is much safer and recommended for constructing SQL queries, especially when dealing with user input or dynamic data."
