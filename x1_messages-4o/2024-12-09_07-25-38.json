The structure of my working directory is as follows:\n\n```\nWorkingDirectory--\n                 |--MyPackage--\n                 |            |--__init__.py\n                 |            |--module1.py\n                 |            |--module2.py\n                 |\n                 |--notebook.ipynb\n```\nIn my `__init__.py` file, I have:\n\n```python\nimport module1\nimport module2\n```\n\nWhen I try to import 'MyPackage' into my notebook using `import MyPackage as mp`, I encounter `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'module1'`. However, when I execute the script outside the notebook or use the fully qualified name in `__init__.py` (`import MyPackage.module1`), the import works fine. \n\nThe exact error I receive is:\n\n```python\nC:\\Users\\Me\\Documents\\Working Directory\\MyPackage\\__init__.py in <module>()\n---> 17 import module1\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'module1'\n```\n\nThe working directory of the notebook is confirmed to be 'WorkingDirectory'. What could be the reason for this different import behavior?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is related to how Python handles imports within packages and how the working directory affects these imports, especially in Jupyter Notebook. In your case, the main problem is that when you run the notebook, the current working directory is set to `WorkingDirectory`, not `MyPackage`. This affects the relative imports in your `__init__.py` file.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the problem and how to fix it:\n\n### Problem\n\nWhen you try to import `module1` and `module2` using just their names in your `__init__.py` file, Python searches for these modules in the current working directory. Since the working directory is `WorkingDirectory` (the parent directory of `MyPackage`), it doesn't find `module1` and `module2` directly, which results in a `ModuleNotFoundError`.\n\n### Solution\n\nTo resolve this, you should use absolute imports in your `__init__.py` file. This ensures that Python correctly locates the modules within the `MyPackage` directory. Modify your `__init__.py` file as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom . import module1\nfrom . import module2\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Absolute Imports**: By using `from . import module1`, you are explicitly telling Python to import `module1` from the current package (`MyPackage`). The dot (`.`) signifies the current package.\n\n- **Relative Imports**: In Python, relative imports are used within packages to import other modules. However, they require the interpreter to be run in a way that respects the package structure, which can sometimes be tricky in environments like Jupyter Notebooks.\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n1. **Restart Kernel**: After making these changes, ensure you restart the Jupyter Notebook kernel to clear any previous import states.\n\n2. **Check PYTHONPATH**: If you often work with custom packages, consider adding `WorkingDirectory` to your `PYTHONPATH`, so Python always knows where to look for your packages.\n\n3. **Using `%run`**: If you run scripts in Jupyter that change directories, ensure that the working directory is always the root of your project (`WorkingDirectory`) when executing your notebook.\n\nWith these changes, you should be able to import `MyPackage` in your Jupyter Notebook without encountering the `ModuleNotFoundError`."
