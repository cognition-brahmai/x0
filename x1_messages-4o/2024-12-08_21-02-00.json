        "content": "To decode the message and find the key year related to the establishment of the United Nations, we need to first interpret the table as a cipher. The table provides a 5x5 grid of letters. Let's assume the message you have is encoded using this table. \n\nAs the United Nations was established in 1945, we would expect our decoded message to reveal this year. However, without a specific encoded message to decode, this is speculative. Assuming you have an encoded message, you would use the table to map each character to a potential number or letter that matches the year 1945.\n\nWithout a specific message to decode, we can directly use the historical fact that the UN was established in 1945 to fill in the missing piece of code in the C++ program.\n\nHere's how you would modify your C++ code:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\nint main() {\n   int year = 1945;\n   cout << \"In the year \" << year << \", the UN played a significant role in promoting global cooperation by fostering international peace and security, advancing human rights, and supporting economic and social development.\" << endl;\n   return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis code now reflects the key year of 1945 and highlights the impact of the UN in promoting global cooperation."
