        "content": "To incorporate an Excel table into your Go code and generate a new word like \"confused dance\" using a prefix from the table, you can use a package like `excelize` to read the Excel file. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n1. **Install the `excelize` package**: This package allows you to read from and write to Excel files. You can install it using:\n\n   ```shell\n   go get github.com/xuri/excelize/v2\n   ```\n\n2. **Read the Excel file**: Use the `excelize` package to read the prefixes and their meanings from the Excel file.\n\n3. **Generate the new word**: Use the prefix from the Excel file to generate the new word.\n\nHere's a sample code that demonstrates how to do this:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"log\"\n\n\t\"github.com/xuri/excelize/v2\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Open the Excel file\n\tf, err := excelize.OpenFile(\"prefixes.xlsx\")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Failed to open Excel file: %v\", err)\n\t}\n\n\t// Get the rows from the first sheet\n\trows, err := f.GetRows(\"Sheet1\")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Failed to get rows: %v\", err)\n\t}\n\n\t// Assume the first row contains headers and start from the second row\n\tword := \"dance\"\n\tvar newWord string\n\tfor _, row := range rows[1:] {\n\t\tif len(row) >= 2 {\n\t\t\tprefix := row[0]\n\t\t\tmeaning := row[1]\n\t\t\tif prefix == \"Con-\" { // Change this condition to select the desired prefix\n\t\t\t\tnewWord = meaning + \" \" + word\n\t\t\t\tbreak\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tif newWord == \"\" {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Prefix not found\")\n\t} else {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"New Word:\", newWord)\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Installation**: First, make sure to install the `excelize` package to handle Excel file operations.\n\n- **Opening the Excel File**: We open the Excel file named `prefixes.xlsx`. Replace `\"Sheet1\"` with the actual sheet name if it's different.\n\n- **Reading the Rows**: We retrieve all the rows from the Excel sheet. We skip the first row since it usually contains headers.\n\n- **Generating the New Word**: We iterate through the rows, check for the desired prefix, and concatenate its meaning with the word \"dance\".\n\n- **Output**: If the desired prefix is found, we output the new word. Otherwise, it notifies that the prefix was not found.\n\nMake sure to replace `\"Sheet1\"` and the filename `\"prefixes.xlsx\"` with the actual sheet name and file path of your Excel file. Adjust the condition `if prefix == \"Con-\"` to select the appropriate prefix based on your logic."
