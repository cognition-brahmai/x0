However, when I want to draw 3D graphs, I would prefer to have them in a separate window to enable interactions like rotation. I know that in Spyder, I can click Tools, Preferences, Ipython Console, Graphics and under Graphics Backend select \u201cautomatic\u201d instead of \u201cinline\u201d. But this causes all my figures to be in new windows, which can get messy when I have numerous plots. Is there a way to configure in Python code which figure to display inline and which one to display in a new window, specifically to display only the 3D plots in new windows while keeping the 2D plots inline?"

        "content": "To achieve selective plotting in either inline or separate windows for 2D and 3D plots in Spyder using Matplotlib, you can use the `%matplotlib` magic commands in a Jupyter/IPython environment. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Default Inline Plotting**: By default, ensure that your 2D plots are set to display inline. You can do this by using `%matplotlib inline` at the start of your script or notebook.\n\n```python\n# Use inline for 2D plots\n%matplotlib inline\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n```\n\n2. **Switch to Interactive for 3D Plots**: Before plotting the 3D graph, switch the backend to `qt`, `tk`, or any other interactive backend that suits your system. This will open the plots in a new window.\n\n```python\n# Switch to an interactive backend for 3D plots\n%matplotlib qt  # or %matplotlib tk\n\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\n\n# Example 3D plot\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')\n\n# Creating some example data\nX = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)\nY = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)\nX, Y = np.meshgrid(X, Y)\nZ = np.sin(np.sqrt(X**2 + Y**2))\n\nax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, cmap='viridis')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n3. **Switch Back to Inline**: After plotting the 3D graph, you can switch back to inline mode for subsequent 2D plots.\n\n```python\n# Switch back to inline for further 2D plots\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# Example 2D plot\nx = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)\ny = np.sin(x)\n\nplt.figure()\nplt.plot(x, y)\nplt.title(\"2D Plot\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\nBy using this approach, you can selectively choose which plots appear inline and which ones pop up in a new window. Note that `%matplotlib` magic commands are specific to IPython environments, such as Jupyter Notebooks or IPython consoles, which Spyder uses. If you are running standalone Python scripts, consider managing backends programmatically, though it might require more substantial changes based on the environment."
