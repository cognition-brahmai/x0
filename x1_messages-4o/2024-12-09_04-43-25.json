Here is the model class I'm working with:\n\n```python\nclass ExampleModel(models.Model):\n    the_field = models.CharField()\n    the_field_two = models.CharField()\n```\n\nI am attempting to access the field dynamically as follows:\n\n```python\nmodel = ExampleModel.objects.get(pk=1)\nfieldtoget = 'the_field'\ntest_var = model[fieldtoget]\n```\n\nHowever, this does not seem to work. Additionally, I am also trying to write a function that can not only get the value of the field but also update it from a variable fieldname, something like this:\n\n```python\nmodel[fieldtoget] = 'yo'\nmodel.save()\n```\n\nIn PHP, I know we can use the {} wrapper - `$model{$fieldtoget}` - for dynamic variable names. I was hoping there is a similar functionality in Python. Any ideas on how I can achieve this?"

        "content": "In Django, you can achieve dynamic access to model fields using Python\u2019s `getattr()` and `setattr()` functions. The syntax you attempted (`model[fieldtoget]`) is not valid in Django because model instances do not support dictionary-like access for fields. Instead, you should use `getattr()` to retrieve the field value and `setattr()` to update it.\n\nHere's how you can dynamically access and update fields of a Django model:\n\n### Accessing a Field Dynamically\n\nTo access a field value dynamically, use `getattr()`:\n\n```python\nmodel = ExampleModel.objects.get(pk=1)\nfieldtoget = 'the_field'\ntest_var = getattr(model, fieldtoget)\nprint(test_var)\n```\n\n### Updating a Field Dynamically\n\nTo update a field value dynamically, use `setattr()`:\n\n```python\nfieldtoset = 'the_field'\nnew_value = 'yo'\nsetattr(model, fieldtoset, new_value)\nmodel.save()\n```\n\n### Function to Get and Update Dynamically\n\nYou can create a utility function for getting and setting field values dynamically:\n\n```python\ndef get_field_value(instance, field_name):\n    return getattr(instance, field_name)\n\ndef set_field_value(instance, field_name, value):\n    setattr(instance, field_name, value)\n    instance.save()\n\n# Usage\nmodel = ExampleModel.objects.get(pk=1)\nfield_name = 'the_field'\n\n# Get field value\nvalue = get_field_value(model, field_name)\nprint(value)\n\n# Set field value\nset_field_value(model, field_name, 'yo')\n```\n\nBy using `getattr()` and `setattr()`, you can dynamically handle field names as strings and manipulate model instances accordingly. This approach is quite powerful and flexible, especially when dealing with dynamic field names."
