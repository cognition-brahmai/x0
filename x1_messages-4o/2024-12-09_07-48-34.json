        "content": "I am looking to extend Python and Numpy by writing modules in C or C++, utilizing BLAS and LAPACK. I also have a requirement to distribute these as standalone C/C++ libraries that can function with both single and double precision float. Examples of functions I plan to write include the conjugate gradient for solving linear systems or accelerated first order methods. Some functions will even require calling a Python function from the C/C++ code. After exploring the Python/C API and the Numpy/C API, I found that many people recommend using Cython instead (referenced in a few Stack Overflow questions). But as I have a bit of knowledge about the Python/C API and none on Cython, I am wondering if it makes sense to continue using the Python/C API, and if there are any advantages of this API over Cython. My future projects might not involve numerical computing, so this query is not strictly about numpy. One thing I enjoy about the Python/C API is that it allows me to learn about the working of the Python interpreter."

        "content": "When deciding between using the Python/C API and Cython for extending Python with C/C++, there are several factors and trade-offs to consider, especially for numerical computing tasks like yours:\n\n### Advantages of Python/C API:\n\n1. **Low-Level Control**: The Python/C API gives you fine-grained control over the interaction between Python and C. This can be beneficial if you need to perform very specific operations or optimizations that higher-level tools may abstract away.\n\n2. **Learning Opportunity**: As you mentioned, using the Python/C API can provide insights into the workings of the Python interpreter, which can be a valuable learning experience.\n\n3. **Portability**: If you're planning to create standalone C/C++ libraries, the Python/C API can help you maintain control over the compiled code, making it easier to distribute cross-platform libraries.\n\n4. **Precision Handling**: You have direct control over precision (single vs. double) when working with C, which can be crucial for numerical computations.\n\n5. **Direct Use of Existing C/C++ Libraries**: If your project heavily relies on existing C/C++ libraries, particularly BLAS and LAPACK, the Python/C API allows you to directly interface with these libraries without additional layers.\n\n### Advantages of Cython:\n\n1. **Simplicity and Productivity**: Cython makes it easier to write C extensions by allowing you to write Python-like code that gets compiled to C. This can significantly reduce development time and complexity.\n\n2. **Automatic Conversion**: Cython handles many of the conversions between Python objects and C types automatically, which can reduce the likelihood of errors and simplify your code.\n\n3. **Performance**: Cython can achieve near-C performance with much less effort compared to writing everything by hand in C using the Python/C API.\n\n4. **Easier Maintenance**: Since Cython code is closer to Python, it can be easier to read and maintain, especially if you have to revisit the code after some time.\n\n5. **Community and Ecosystem**: Cython is widely used in the scientific Python community. It has a strong ecosystem and support, which might be beneficial for your project.\n\n6. **Interfacing with Python**: If you need to call Python functions from your C/C++ code, Cython provides a more seamless way to do this compared to manually managing Python objects and function calls via the Python/C API.\n\n### Considerations:\n\n- **Future Projects**: If your future projects might not involve numerical computing, learning Cython can be advantageous because it is versatile and applicable to a wide range of tasks, not just numerical ones.\n\n- **Existing Knowledge**: Since you already have some knowledge of the Python/C API, it might be worth continuing with it for this particular project, but consider investing time in learning Cython for future projects, especially if ease of use and development speed become priorities.\n\nUltimately, the choice between using the Python/C API and Cython depends on your specific needs and preferences. If you enjoy the low-level control and learning experience, the Python/C API is suitable. However, if productivity and ease of use are more important, and especially if your project could benefit from the capabilities of Cython, it might be worth investing the time to learn and use it."
