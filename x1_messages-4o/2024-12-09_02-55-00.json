The \"Godzina\" app is defined as follows:\n\n```\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass Godzina (models.Model):\n        GODZINA = (\n        ('19', '19'),\n        ('20', '20'),\n        ('21', '21'),\n        )\n        godzina = models.CharField(max_length=6, choices=GODZINA, verbose_name='jezyk')\n```\n\nAnd the \"UserProfile\" app like this:\n\n```\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User\nfrom godzina.models import Godzina\n\nclass UserProfile(models.Model):\n    czas = models.ForeignKey('Godzina')   \n    user = models.OneToOneField(User)\n```\n\nHowever, I am encountering an error stating: \"userprofile.UserProfile.czas: (fields.E300) Field defines a relation with model 'Godzina', which is either not installed, or is abstract\". I want the user to only pick such time as an administrator put in the app \"Godzina\". For example, if I'm defining hours 19 pm, 20 pm, then the user can choose those values in UserProfile app. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering indicates that Django can't find the `Godzina` model, which usually means there's an issue with how the apps are structured or registered. Here are steps to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check App Registration:**\n   Make sure both `Godzina` and `UserProfile` apps are listed in the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting in your Django project's `settings.py` file. It should look something like this:\n\n   ```python\n   INSTALLED_APPS = [\n       ...\n       'godzina',\n       'userprofile',\n       ...\n   ]\n   ```\n\n2. **Correct Import Path:**\n   Ensure that the import statement in `UserProfile` is correct. It should match the app name exactly as it is registered in `INSTALLED_APPS`.\n\n   ```python\n   from godzina.models import Godzina\n   ```\n\n3. **Model Definition:**\n   Ensure there are no typos in your model definitions and that the `Godzina` model is not accidentally marked as abstract.\n\n4. **ForeignKey Declaration:**\n   In your `UserProfile` model, make sure to use `on_delete` for the ForeignKey. This is required in Django 2.0 and later:\n\n   ```python\n   class UserProfile(models.Model):\n       czas = models.ForeignKey(Godzina, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n       user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n   ```\n\n5. **Migrations:**\n   Run the migrations again to ensure that Django recognizes all models correctly. Use the following commands:\n\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py makemigrations\n   python manage.py migrate\n   ```\n\n6. **Check App Structure:**\n   Double-check that your app folders and files are structured correctly. Each app should have an `__init__.py`, `models.py`, and be in the root of your Django project directory.\n\n7. **Django Version Compatibility:**\n   Ensure that your Django version is compatible with the code syntax and features you are using.\n\n8. **Restart the Server:**\n   After making these changes, restart your Django development server to ensure all changes are applied.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and allow users to select times defined in the `Godzina` model within the `UserProfile` app."
