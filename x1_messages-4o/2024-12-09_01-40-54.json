Reverse the list of split parts.\n3. Join the reversed list back into a single string.\n\nHere's a step-by-step example:\n\n```python\n# Original string\noriginal_string = \"Python is amazing\"\n\n# Step 1: Split the string into a list of words\nsplit_parts = original_string.split()\n\n# Step 2: Reverse the list of split parts\nreversed_parts = split_parts[::-1]\n\n# Step 3: Join the reversed list back into a single string\nreversed_string = ' '.join(reversed_parts)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(reversed_string)\n```\n\nIn this example, the original string \"Python is amazing\" would be split into `['Python', 'is', 'amazing']`, reversed to `['amazing', 'is', 'Python']`, and then joined back together to form the string \"amazing is Python\"."
