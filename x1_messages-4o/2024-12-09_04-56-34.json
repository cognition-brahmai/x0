I have tried the following code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\n\nax = plt.axes(projection='3d')\nax.plot([0,1],[0,1],[0,10])\nax.set_aspect('equal','box')\n```\n\nIt works fine for 2D plots as shown in the code below:\n\n```python\nax = plt.axes()\nax.plot([0,1],[0,10])\nax.set_aspect('equal','box')\n```\n\nHowever, the aspect ratio does not seem to be setting correctly for the 3D plot. Is there a different syntax I should use for the 3D case, or is this functionality not implemented?"

        "content": "When working with 3D plots in Matplotlib, setting the aspect ratio can be a bit tricky, as `set_aspect('equal')` is not directly supported for 3D plots. However, you can achieve a similar effect by manually setting the limits for each axis to equalize them. Here's an approach you can take:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Sample data\nx = np.array([0, 1])\ny = np.array([0, 1])\nz = np.array([0, 10])\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')\nax.plot(x, y, z)\n\n# Function to set the aspect ratio to be equal\ndef set_axes_equal(ax):\n    \"\"\"Set 3D plot axes to equal scale.\"\"\"\n    x_limits = ax.get_xlim3d()\n    y_limits = ax.get_ylim3d()\n    z_limits = ax.get_zlim3d()\n\n    x_range = abs(x_limits[1] - x_limits[0])\n    y_range = abs(y_limits[1] - y_limits[0])\n    z_range = abs(z_limits[1] - z_limits[0])\n\n    max_range = max(x_range, y_range, z_range)\n\n    # Calculate new limits\n    x_middle = np.mean(x_limits)\n    y_middle = np.mean(y_limits)\n    z_middle = np.mean(z_limits)\n\n    ax.set_xlim3d([x_middle - max_range/2, x_middle + max_range/2])\n    ax.set_ylim3d([y_middle - max_range/2, y_middle + max_range/2])\n    ax.set_zlim3d([z_middle - max_range/2, z_middle + max_range/2])\n\nset_axes_equal(ax)\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis function `set_axes_equal` adjusts the limits of the axes so that they are all scaled equally, which gives the visual effect of an equal aspect ratio. This is a workaround since the `set_aspect` method isn't natively supported for 3D plots in Matplotlib."
