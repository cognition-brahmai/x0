I am working with the cifar10 dataset and when I execute the code on a system with Keras installed, the dataset gets downloaded once in the `~/.keras/datasets/` directory. However, when I install Keras in a Docker container, the `~/.keras` directory doesn't seem to exist. I am certain that the data is being saved somewhere because I am able to load the dataset in a Docker image run through a container with bash. Where are these files saved? Additionally, I want to volume my local `~/.keras/` with the Docker containers to avoid downloading the datasets multiple times. However, even though I have volumed the folder correctly, it appears to still download the dataset. What might be the reason for this?"

        "content": "When you run Keras inside a Docker container, the datasets are stored in the Docker container's file system, which is isolated from your host machine's file system. By default, Keras uses the `~/.keras/datasets/` directory inside the container to save downloaded datasets. However, the `~` (home directory) inside a Docker container is relative to the user and environment set up within that container, which is why it doesn't directly correlate to your host machine's home directory.\n\nHere are a few considerations and steps to address your issue:\n\n1. **Finding the Dataset Location in Docker:**\n   - The datasets should be located inside the container at the path relative to the user's home directory, usually `/root/.keras/datasets/` if the container runs as the root user, unless the environment or user configuration specifies otherwise.\n\n2. **Voluming `~/.keras/` from Host to Docker:**\n   - To share the dataset between the host and the container, you need to correctly map the host directory to the container directory using Docker volumes.\n   - Ensure your Docker run command includes something like:\n     ```bash\n     docker run -v /path/to/host/.keras:/root/.keras ...\n     ```\n     Replace `/path/to/host/.keras` with the actual path to your host's `.keras` directory.\n   - Ensure that the paths are correct according to the user context inside the container.\n\n3. **Downloading Dataset Multiple Times:**\n   - If the dataset is still being downloaded even after setting up volumes, check the following:\n     - Verify that the volume mapping is correctly specified and pointing to the right directories.\n     - Ensure that the Docker container has the necessary permissions to read/write to the mapped volume.\n     - Check if the dataset path inside the container is indeed being used by Keras. You can set the environment variable `KERAS_HOME` to explicitly define the dataset path within the container:\n       ```bash\n       docker run -e KERAS_HOME=/root/.keras -v /path/to/host/.keras:/root/.keras ...\n       ```\n\nBy ensuring that the paths are correctly set up and permissions are handled, you should be able to avoid downloading the dataset multiple times and use the shared volume effectively."
