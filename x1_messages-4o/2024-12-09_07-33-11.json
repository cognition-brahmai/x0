However, when I try to execute `requests.get('https://mysite.com', verify=True)`, I get an error stating that the hostname 'mysite.com' doesn't match either of '*.myhost.com', 'myhost.com'. This is confusing since the certificate seems fine when I check it on the browser or via http://www.digicert.com/help/. My host believes it could be due to the lack of SNI support from requests, as it seems to be confirmed on GitHub at https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/issues/749. Is there any workaround for this problem using requests?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to Server Name Indication (SNI), which is an extension to the TLS protocol that allows a client to specify the hostname it is trying to connect to at the start of the handshaking process. This allows the server to present the correct SSL certificate for the domain being requested.\n\nThe error you're seeing indicates that the SSL certificate presented by the server doesn't match the domain name you're using in your request. In your case, it seems the SSL certificate is valid for `*.myhost.com` and `myhost.com`, but you're trying to access `mysite.com`, which doesn't match the certificate's domain names.\n\nHere are some potential workarounds to address this issue:\n\n1. **Use the Correct Domain Name**: Ensure you're using a domain name in your requests that matches the domain names listed in the SSL certificate. If `mysite.com` is supposed to be covered by the certificate, ensure that the certificate is indeed configured for `mysite.com`.\n\n2. **Update the Requests Library**: As of the recent versions of the Requests library, SNI is supported if you're using a version of Python with an SSL module built against OpenSSL 1.0.1+ (most modern Python distributions do). Ensure you have the latest version of Requests and Python to avoid compatibility issues.\n\n3. **Use a Session with SNI Support**: If you're using an older environment, you can try using the `urllib3` and `pyOpenSSL` libraries, which offer more control and may support SNI better in certain environments. Here's an example of how you might use these:\n\n   ```python\n   import requests\n   from requests.packages.urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl import inject_into_urllib3\n\n   inject_into_urllib3()\n\n   response = requests.get('https://mysite.com', verify=True)\n   print(response.content)\n   ```\n\n   This code snippet injects SNI support into `urllib3`, which Requests uses internally.\n\n4. **Check Your DNS Configuration**: Ensure that the DNS configuration for `mysite.com` is correct and resolves to the intended server.\n\n5. **Contact Your Hosting Provider**: If you have control over the server, you may need to update the server configuration to correctly handle requests for `mysite.com` and present the correct certificate.\n\nIf none of these solutions work, it may be worth revisiting the server's SSL configuration or consulting with the hosting provider to ensure that the SSL certificate and server settings are correctly configured for the intended domain."
