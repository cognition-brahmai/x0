Below is a Scala code snippet that calculates the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100:\n\n```scala\nobject EvenSum {\n  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\n    val sum = (1 to 100).filter(_ % 2 == 0).sum\n    println(s\"The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is: $sum\")\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow, let's modify the code to calculate the sum of all even numbers between a given range of numbers:\n\n```scala\nobject EvenSumInRange {\n  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\n    // Define the range\n    val start = 1\n    val end = 100\n\n    // Calculate the sum of even numbers in the given range\n    val sum = (start to end).filter(_ % 2 == 0).sum\n    println(s\"The sum of all even numbers between $start and $end is: $sum\")\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this modified version, you can adjust the `start` and `end` variables to any desired range, and the program will compute the sum of all even numbers within that range."
