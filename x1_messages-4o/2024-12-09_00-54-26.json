I aim to draw empty circles around some of the colored disks that have already been plotted by the `scatter()` function, without having to redraw the colored circles.

        "content": "To create a scatter plot with empty circles around some of the already plotted colored disks in Matplotlib, you can use the `scatter()` function with different edge and face color settings. Specifically, you'll want to set the `facecolors` parameter to `'none'` to make the circles appear empty, while you can specify the edge color using the `edgecolors` parameter. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. First, plot your initial scatter plot with colored disks.\n2. Overlay another scatter plot with the same coordinates but with empty circles.\n\nHere is an example to illustrate this process:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Sample data\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ny = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\ncolors = ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'orange', 'purple']\n\n# Plot the initial scatter with colored disks\nplt.scatter(x, y, c=colors, s=100, label='Colored Disks')\n\n# Overlay with empty circles around some points (e.g., all points)\nplt.scatter(x, y, facecolors='none', edgecolors='black', s=150, label='Empty Circles')\n\n# Add legend\nplt.legend()\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.xlabel('X-axis')\nplt.ylabel('Y-axis')\nplt.title('Scatter Plot with Empty Circles')\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- The initial `scatter()` call plots the filled circles using the specified `colors`.\n- The second `scatter()` call overlays empty circles (using `facecolors='none'`) with a slightly larger size (`s=150`) and a black edge (`edgecolors='black'`). You can adjust the size and color as needed to achieve the desired visual effect.\n\nThis approach lets you add empty circles without redrawing or affecting the original colored disks."
