Below is a simple Java program that reverses the characters of a given string:\n\n```java\npublic class StringReverser {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Example string to reverse\n        String inputString = \"Hello, World!\";\n        \n        // Call the reverseString method\n        String reversedString = reverseString(inputString);\n        \n        // Output the result\n        System.out.println(\"Original String: \" + inputString);\n        System.out.println(\"Reversed String: \" + reversedString);\n    }\n\n    // Method to reverse a string\n    public static String reverseString(String str) {\n        // Convert the string to a character array\n        char[] charArray = str.toCharArray();\n        \n        // Initialize pointers for the start and end of the array\n        int left = 0;\n        int right = charArray.length - 1;\n        \n        // Swap characters while traversing the array from both ends\n        while (left < right) {\n            // Swap the characters at left and right positions\n            char temp = charArray[left];\n            charArray[left] = charArray[right];\n            charArray[right] = temp;\n            \n            // Move the pointers towards the center\n            left++;\n            right--;\n        }\n        \n        // Convert the character array back to a string and return\n        return new String(charArray);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The program defines a method `reverseString` that takes a string as input and returns its reversed version.\n- It converts the string into a character array to facilitate swapping of characters.\n- Two pointers (`left` and `right`) are used to traverse the character array from both ends. Characters are swapped until the pointers meet in the middle.\n- The reversed character array is then converted back into a string and returned.\n\nYou can test this program with different input strings to see how it handles them."
