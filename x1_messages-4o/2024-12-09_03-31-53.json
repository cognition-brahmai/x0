The code I am using is as follows:\n```python\nimport re\nre.compile(\"\\d{3}\")\n```\nThe warning message I receive is:\n```python\nID:W1401  Anomalous backslash in string: '\\d'. String constant might be missing an r prefix.\n```\nCan someone explain the meaning of this warning message? What changes do I need to make in my code to pass warning W1401? It is worth mentioning that my code passes all the tests and runs as expected, and \"\\d{3}\" is a valid regex."

        "content": "The warning message you're seeing is related to the way backslashes are interpreted in Python string literals. In Python, backslashes are used as escape characters, which can lead to confusion when you're working with regular expressions (regex) that also use backslashes.\n\nIn your regex pattern `\"\\d{3}\"`, the backslash `\\` is used to escape the `d`, which denotes a digit character in regex. However, Python interprets backslashes as escape characters for special sequences like `\\n` (newline) or `\\t` (tab). The warning is suggesting that Python might misinterpret your regex pattern because it thinks you're trying to escape a character.\n\nTo avoid this confusion and to clarify that the backslashes in your string are meant for the regex parser and not Python's string parser, you can use a raw string. Raw strings are defined by prefixing the string with `r`, which tells Python to treat backslashes as literal characters and not escape sequences.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use a raw string:\n\n```python\nimport re\nre.compile(r\"\\d{3}\")\n```\n\nBy using `r\"\\d{3}\"` instead of `\"\\d{3}\"`, you're making it clear that the backslash is part of the regex syntax and not an escape character in the string. This should resolve the warning you're seeing and makes your regex pattern more robust and less prone to errors related to escape sequences."
