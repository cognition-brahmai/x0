Organize Regular Feedback and Communication Sessions:**\n- **Description:** Implement regular, informal feedback sessions where employees can share their thoughts with management. Use these sessions to communicate company goals and align them with individual roles.\n- **Impact:** Improves communication between employees and leadership, ensuring clear direction and support.
