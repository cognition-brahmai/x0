        "content": "Certainly! You can use a dictionary in Python to map each fruit in the list to a unique number. Here's an example:\n\n```python\n# List of fruits\nfruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry']\n\n# Create a dictionary to map each fruit to a unique number\nfruit_dict = {fruit: index for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits, start=1)}\n\n# Print the resulting dictionary\nprint(fruit_dict)\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, `enumerate` is used to iterate over the list of fruits, providing both the index and the fruit. The `start=1` argument in `enumerate` ensures that numbering starts from 1. The resulting dictionary `fruit_dict` will look like this:\n\n```\n{'Apple': 1, 'Banana': 2, 'Cherry': 3}\n```\n\nEach fruit is matched with a unique number. You can adjust the starting number or the list of fruits as needed."
