In Python, I can do this: \"File {file} had error {error}\".format(file=myfile, error=err) or this: \"File %(file)s had error %(error)s\" % {\"file\": myfile, \"error\": err}. However, in Go, the simplest option is: fmt.Sprintf(\"File %s had error %s\", myfile, err), which doesn't allow me to swap the order of the parameters in the format string, something I need to do for I18N. While Go does have the template package, it seems like a long way to go for an error message. Is there a more reasonable option that allows me to give string parameters independent of order?"

        "content": "In Go, while `fmt.Sprintf` is commonly used for formatted strings, it doesn't support named placeholders like Python's string formatting methods. However, for internationalization (I18N) and more flexible string formatting, there are a few alternative approaches you can consider:\n\n1. **Using `text/template` or `html/template`:** While these packages are typically used for more complex templating, you can leverage them for simple string replacement with named placeholders. Here's an example:\n\n    ```go\n    package main\n\n    import (\n        \"os\"\n        \"text/template\"\n    )\n\n    func main() {\n        tmpl, err := template.New(\"error\").Parse(\"File {{.File}} had error {{.Error}}\")\n        if err != nil {\n            panic(err)\n        }\n\n        data := map[string]string{\n            \"File\":  \"example.txt\",\n            \"Error\": \"file not found\",\n        }\n\n        err = tmpl.Execute(os.Stdout, data)\n        if err != nil {\n            panic(err)\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n   This approach allows you to use named placeholders and gives you the flexibility to change the order of parameters easily.\n\n2. **Using a third-party library:** There are libraries available that mimic Python-style formatting. One such library is `github.com/leekchan/gtf`, which provides named parameter support. Here's how you could use it:\n\n    ```go\n    package main\n\n    import (\n        \"fmt\"\n        \"github.com/leekchan/gtf\"\n    )\n\n    func main() {\n        format := \"File {{file}} had error {{error}}\"\n        params := map[string]interface{}{\n            \"file\":  \"example.txt\",\n            \"error\": \"file not found\",\n        }\n\n        result, err := gtf.Render(format, params)\n        if err != nil {\n            panic(err)\n        }\n\n        fmt.Println(result)\n    }\n    ```\n\nThese methods provide more flexibility compared to `fmt.Sprintf`, especially when dealing with I18N, as they allow you to specify parameters by name rather than by position."
