Install `flynt` using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install flynt\n   ```\n\n2. Run `flynt` on your codebase:\n\n   ```bash\n   flynt path/to/your/code\n   ```\n\nThis will update your code with the new f-string syntax. Keep in mind that it's always a good practice to review the changes made by such tools to ensure everything works as expected."
