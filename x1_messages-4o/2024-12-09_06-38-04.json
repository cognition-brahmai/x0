I have the absolute URL of the page, and a relative link found within that page, and I want to definitively reconstruct or make a best-effort to reconstruct the absolute URL of the relative link. I am reading an HTML file from a given URL using Beautiful Soup, stripping out all the img tag sources, and trying to construct a list of absolute URLs to the page images. Here is my Python function so far:\n\n```python\nfunction get_image_url(page_url,image_src):\n\n    from urlparse import urlparse\n    # parsed = urlparse('http://user:pass@NetLoc:80/path;parameters?query=argument#fragment')\n    parsed = urlparse(page_url)\n    url_base = parsed.netloc\n    url_path = parsed.path\n\n    if src.find('http') == 0:\n        # It's an absolute URL, do nothing.\n        pass\n    elif src.find('/') == 0:\n        # If it's a root URL, append it to the base URL:\n        src = 'http://' + url_base + src\n    else:\n        # If it's a relative URL, ?\n```\n\nI am unsure how to handle the relative URLs. I don't necessarily need a Python answer, but I need help with the logic required to solve this problem."

        "content": "To reconstruct absolute URLs from relative ones, you need to consider different cases regarding the structure of the relative URL. Let's break down the logic you need to implement:\n\n1. **Absolute URLs**: If the `image_src` starts with `http://` or `https://`, it's already an absolute URL. You don't need to modify it.\n\n2. **Root-relative URLs**: If `image_src` starts with a `/`, it means it is relative to the root of the domain. You should append this path to the base URL.\n\n3. **Path-relative URLs**: If `image_src` doesn't start with `/`, it is relative to the current path of the page URL. You'll need to append this relative path to the directory of the current page URL.\n\nHere's a refined Python function to implement this logic using the `urljoin` function from the `urllib.parse` module, which is designed to handle these cases:\n\n```python\nfrom urllib.parse import urljoin\n\ndef get_image_url(page_url, image_src):\n    # urljoin will handle all the cases: absolute, root-relative, and path-relative URLs\n    absolute_url = urljoin(page_url, image_src)\n    return absolute_url\n\n# Example usage:\npage_url = 'http://example.com/folder/page.html'\nimage_srcs = [\n    'http://example.com/absolute/image.jpg',  # Absolute URL\n    '/images/root_relative/image.jpg',        # Root-relative URL\n    'relative/image.jpg'                      # Path-relative URL\n]\n\nabsolute_image_urls = [get_image_url(page_url, src) for src in image_srcs]\nprint(absolute_image_urls)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`urljoin`**: This function from `urllib.parse` is designed to construct absolute URLs from relative URLs in the context of a base URL. It handles the complexities of URL path resolution, including relative directory navigation (like `..` or `.`).\n\n- **Handling Different Cases**:\n  - For absolute URLs, `urljoin` will simply return the original URL.\n  - For root-relative URLs, `urljoin` appends the path to the domain.\n  - For path-relative URLs, `urljoin` resolves the URL based on the current directory of `page_url`.\n\nThis approach ensures that you correctly handle all typical URL structures encountered on web pages."
