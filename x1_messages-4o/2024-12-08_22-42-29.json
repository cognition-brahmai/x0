        "content": "To modify the given Python code to express the sentence \"He can drive\" in the negative form, you need to ensure the function replaces \"can\" with \"cannot\" correctly and handles contractions like \"can't\" if necessary. The current code seems to replace \"can\" with \"cannot\" correctly, but if you want to ensure it handles contractions like \"can't\" in a more sophisticated way, or if you want to maintain consistency with typical English negation, you can consider using \"can't\" instead of \"cannot\". Here's how you can modify the code:\n\n```python\ndef negate_sentence(sentence):\n    words = sentence.split()\n    if \"can\" in words:\n        words[words.index(\"can\")] = \"cannot\"  # Replace \"can\" with \"cannot\"\n    else:\n        words.insert(0, \"cannot\")  # If \"can\" is not present, prepend \"cannot\"\n    negated_sentence = \" \".join(words)\n    return negated_sentence\n\noriginal_sentence = \"He can drive\"\nnegated_sentence = negate_sentence(original_sentence)\nprint(\"The negated form of '\" + original_sentence + \"' is: \" + negated_sentence)\n```\n\nWith this code, if the original sentence is \"He can drive\", the output will be: \"The negated form of 'He can drive' is: He cannot drive\".\n\nThe code already handles the negation effectively for the sentence \"He can drive\" by replacing \"can\" with \"cannot\", which is a common way to express negation in English. If you prefer using \"can't\" instead, you can adjust the replacement to \"can't\"."
