        "content": "Your current approach using `components(separatedBy:)`, `filter`, and `joined(separator:)` is quite efficient and straightforward for removing unnecessary words from a sentence in Swift. However, you can improve it slightly by using a `Set` for `unnecessaryWords` instead of an `Array`. This change can make the lookup in `contains` faster because `Set` provides constant time complexity for lookups, while `Array` provides linear time complexity. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```swift\nlet sentence = \"He had a really bad headache, it was very intense.\"\nlet unnecessaryWords: Set = [\"really\", \"bad\", \"very\"]\nlet conciseSentence = sentence\n    .components(separatedBy: \" \")\n    .filter { !unnecessaryWords.contains($0) }\n    .joined(separator: \" \")\nprint(conciseSentence)\n```\n\nThis change is minor but can make a difference if you have a large number of unnecessary words or if you are processing many sentences. Overall, your approach is efficient for most practical purposes."
