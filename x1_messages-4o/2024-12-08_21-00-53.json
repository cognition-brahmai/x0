Can you provide a sample code that generates a tree structure with the following subtopics: SEO, SEM, email marketing, social media, content marketing, mobile marketing, affiliate marketing, analytics, conversion rate optimization, and branding? The nodes should be labeled with their respective subtopics and the edges should connect them in a logical hierarchy."

        "content": "Creating a taxonomy tree in LaTeX can be effectively done using the `forest` package, which is specifically designed for creating tree diagrams. Below is a sample code that demonstrates how to create a taxonomy tree for digital marketing with the specified subtopics. The hierarchy is organized in a way that groups related subtopics together under a broader concept.\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass[tikz,border=10pt]{standalone}\n\\usepackage{forest}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\\begin{forest}\n  for tree={\n    grow=east,\n    draw,\n    rounded corners,\n    node options={align=center},\n    edge={->, thick},\n    parent anchor=east,\n    child anchor=west,\n    l sep=1cm,\n    s sep=1cm,\n    edge path={\n      \\noexpand\\path [\\forestoption{edge}]\n      (!u.parent anchor) -- +(5pt,0) |- (.child anchor)\\forestoption{edge label};\n    },\n    before typesetting nodes={\n      if n=1\n        {for children={tier=level(\\value{forestlevel})}}\n    }\n  }\n  [Digital Marketing\n    [SEO]\n    [SEM]\n    [Content Marketing\n      [Blogging]\n      [Video Marketing]\n    ]\n    [Email Marketing]\n    [Social Media\n      [Facebook]\n      [Instagram]\n      [Twitter]\n    ]\n    [Mobile Marketing]\n    [Affiliate Marketing]\n    [Analytics]\n    [Conversion Rate Optimization]\n    [Branding]\n  ]\n\\end{forest}\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Root Node:** The root of the tree is labeled \"Digital Marketing,\" representing the main category.\n- **Subtopics:** The tree branches out into your specified subtopics: SEO, SEM, Email Marketing, etc.\n- **Logical Hierarchy:** Certain subtopics are grouped under broader categories for a logical hierarchy (e.g., Content Marketing has sub-nodes like Blogging and Video Marketing).\n- **Visual Style:** The tree uses arrows connecting the nodes to indicate a hierarchical relationship.\n\nTo compile this code, ensure you use a LaTeX editor that supports TikZ and the `forest` package, such as Overleaf. This will create a clean, visual representation of your digital marketing taxonomy tree."
