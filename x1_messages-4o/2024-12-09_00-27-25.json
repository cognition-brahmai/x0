        "content": "As a beginner in Python programming, I'm finding it cumbersome to decrease the indentation of a block of codes. Is there a quicker way to do this instead of doing it line by line? For instance, with the following code:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(density):\n   if i < 5:\n      x, y = rnd(0,shape[1]//2)*2, rnd(0,shape[0]//2)*2\n      Z[y,x] = 1 \n      ...\n      ...\n```\n\nIf I were to comment the `if` statement, I would need to decrease the indentation for lines in the `if` block one by one. Is there a shortcut or a way that I can do this in one stroke, similar to how I can increase the indentation of a block of codes by selecting them and pressing the TAB key? I'm aware that this might be dependent on the environment, so could you please provide solutions for Eclipse+Pydev, VIM, and other common editors?"

        "content": "Certainly! Decreasing indentation for a block of code can often be done using keyboard shortcuts in many code editors. Here's how you can do it in some common editors:\n\n### Eclipse + PyDev\n1. **Decrease Indentation**: Select the block of code you want to decrease the indentation for, and then press `Shift + Tab`. This will decrease the indentation level for all selected lines.\n\n### VIM\n1. **Decrease Indentation**: In VIM, you can decrease the indentation by using the `<<` command. First, select the lines you want to adjust. You can enter Visual mode by pressing `V` and using the arrow keys to select multiple lines, then press `<<` to decrease the indentation.\n2. **Alternatively**: If you're in Normal mode and know the number of lines you want to adjust, you can specify it. For example, `3<<` would decrease the indentation of the next three lines.\n\n### Visual Studio Code\n1. **Decrease Indentation**: Select the lines you want to decrease indent for, then press `Shift + Tab`.\n\n### PyCharm\n1. **Decrease Indentation**: Select the lines you want to adjust, then press `Shift + Tab` to decrease the indentation.\n\n### Sublime Text\n1. **Decrease Indentation**: Select the text and press `Shift + Tab`.\n\n### Atom\n1. **Decrease Indentation**: Select the lines and press `Shift + Tab` to decrease the indentation.\n\n### General Tip\n- In most modern text editors and IDEs, the `Shift + Tab` shortcut is commonly used to decrease indentation for selected lines. If you're ever in doubt, you can usually find the specific shortcut for your editor by looking up the documentation or checking under the \"Edit\" menu where indentation options are often listed.\n\nIf you're using a different editor, the concept is generally the same: select the lines and use the appropriate shortcut to decrease indentation. Adjusting indentation efficiently can save you a lot of time, especially when dealing with nested code blocks."
