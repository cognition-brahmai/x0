        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to a naming conflict with the file `unittest.py`. In Python, when you import a module, it first looks in the current directory for a file with that name. If it finds one, it imports it instead of the standard library module you're expecting. In your case, it seems like there is a file named `unittest.py` in the same directory or path as `test.py`, which is shadowing the standard library's `unittest` module.\n\nHere\u2019s what you can do to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Rename the Local `unittest.py` File**: If you have a file named `unittest.py` in your working directory or any directory in your Python path, rename it to something else (e.g., `my_unittest.py`). This will prevent it from shadowing the standard library module.\n\n2. **Check for `unittest.pyc` or `__pycache__`**: After renaming the local `unittest.py`, make sure to also delete any compiled versions of that file, like `unittest.pyc` or any cache in the `__pycache__` directory, as these can also interfere.\n\n3. **Verify the Import**: Once you have renamed or removed the local `unittest.py`, try running your script again. It should now correctly import the standard library's `unittest` module.\n\n4. **Use Absolute Imports**: Ensure that you are using absolute imports when importing modules, especially if your project grows larger or involves multiple packages.\n\nAfter making these changes, your code should run without encountering the `AttributeError`."
