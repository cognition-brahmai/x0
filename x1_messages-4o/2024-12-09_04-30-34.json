My DataFrame looks like this:\n\n<pre>\n+-----------------------------------------------------------\n|      DB_user                            source   count  |                                             \n+-----------------------------------------------------------\n| ???/\"\u00d2|Z?)?]??C %??J                      A        10   |                                       \n| ?D$ZGU   ;@D??_???T(?)

I thought by using the loop in the filter_func function, I was dealing with this by inputting a char into 'ord'. Therefore the moment it hits a non-ASCII character, it should be replaced by a space. Can anyone help me with this?"

    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that `apply` with `axis=1` passes an entire row (as a Series) to the function, not just a single string from the 'DB_user' column. Your function is expecting a single string input, not a Series, which is why you're facing issues with using `ord`.\n\nTo correctly apply your function only to the 'DB_user' column, you should directly apply it to that column. Additionally, your current function is not correctly handling the replacement of non-ASCII characters with spaces. I'll correct the function and show you how to apply it:\n\nHere's a corrected version of your function and how to apply it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndata = {\n    'DB_user': [\n        '???/\"\u00d2|Z?)?]??C %??J',\n        '?D$ZGU   ;@D??_???T(?)',\n        '?Q`H??M\\'?Y??KTK$?\u00d9\u2039???\u00d0\u00a9JL4??*?_??'\n    ],\n    'source': ['A', 'B', 'C'],\n    'count': [10, 3, 2]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\ndef filter_func(string):\n    return ''.join(char if 32 <= ord(char) <= 126 else ' ' for char in string)\n\n# Apply the function to the 'DB_user' column\ndf['DB_user'] = df['DB_user'].apply(filter_func)\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Function Update:**\n   - The function `filter_func` now uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the string.\n   - It checks if the ASCII value of the character is between 32 and 126 (inclusive). If so, it keeps the character; otherwise, it replaces it with a space.\n\n2. **Correct Application:**\n   - Use `df['DB_user'].apply(filter_func)` to apply the function only to the 'DB_user' column, rather than using `apply` with `axis=1`.\n\nThis should correctly replace non-ASCII characters in the 'DB_user' column with spaces, and you should not encounter the error anymore."
