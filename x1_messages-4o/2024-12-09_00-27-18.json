The webpage is part of a company's internal site that requires login, so I saved the source code into a local file named \"example.html\" on my C:\\ drive. However, when I try to use the local file with BeautifulSoup and Python, I get an error when I try to use urllib2.urlopen to open the file. How can I use BeautifulSoup with a local file? \n\nHere's the code I have so far:\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport re\nimport urllib2\n\nurl = \"C:\\example.html\"\npage = urllib2.urlopen(url)\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(page.read())\n\ncities = soup.find_all('span', {'class' : 'city-sh'})\n\nfor city in cities:\n    print city\n```\n\nAnd the error I'm getting is:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n   File \"C:\\Python27\\Testing.py\", line 8, in <module>\n     page = urllib2.urlopen(url)\n   File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\urllib2.py\", line 127, in urlopen\n     return _opener.open(url, data, timeout)\n   File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\urllib2.py\", line 404, in open\n     response = self._open(req, data)\n   File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\urllib2.py\", line 427, in _open\n     'unknown_open', req)\n   File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\urllib2.py\", line 382, in _call_chain\n     result = func(*args)\n   File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\urllib2.py\", line 1247, in unknown_open\n     raise URLError('unknown url type: %s' % type)\nURLError: <urlopen error unknown url type: c>\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the incorrect handling of the file path by `urllib2.urlopen`. `urllib2` is designed to open URLs, not local files. To read a local file, you should use Python's built-in file handling functions instead. Here's how you can modify your code to use BeautifulSoup with a local HTML file:\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n# Use Python's built-in open function to open the local file\nfile_path = r\"C:\\example.html\"  # Use a raw string or double backslashes to handle the backslashes in the path\nwith open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n    # Read the content of the file\n    page_content = file.read()\n\n# Parse the content with BeautifulSoup\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(page_content, 'html.parser')\n\n# Find all the 'span' elements with class 'city-sh'\ncities = soup.find_all('span', {'class': 'city-sh'})\n\n# Print the content of each city\nfor city in cities:\n    print(city.text)  # Use .text to get the text inside the span tag\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **File Path**: Use `r\"C:\\example.html\"` to avoid escape character issues, or alternatively, use double backslashes like `\"C:\\\\example.html\"`.\n\n2. **File Handling**: Use Python's `open()` function to read the file. This is more suitable for local file handling as opposed to `urllib2.urlopen`, which is meant for URLs.\n\n3. **Parser Specification**: It's a good practice to specify the parser, like `'html.parser'`, when creating a `BeautifulSoup` object.\n\nThis should resolve the issue and allow you to parse the local HTML file successfully."
