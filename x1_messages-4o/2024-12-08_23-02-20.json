        "content": "To calculate the average yield of apples per farmer for this year using R, you'll first need to ensure that your dataset is organized appropriately. Let's assume your dataset is in a data frame called `fruit_data` and it contains at least the following columns:\n\n- `FarmerID`: Unique identifier for each farmer\n- `FruitType`: Type of fruit produced (e.g., \"Apple\")\n- `Year`: Year of production\n- `Yield`: Amount of fruit produced\n\nHere is the R code to calculate the average yield of apples per farmer for the current year:\n\n```r\n# Sample data frame\nfruit_data <- data.frame(\n  FarmerID = c(1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 4),\n  FruitType = c(\"Apple\", \"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Apple\", \"Apple\", \"Orange\", \"Apple\", \"Apple\"),\n  Year = c(2023, 2023, 2023, 2023, 2023, 2023, 2023, 2023),\n  Yield = c(100, 150, 200, 120, 170, 180, 130, 140)\n)\n\n# Filter data for apples in the current year\ncurrent_year <- 2023\napples_current_year <- subset(fruit_data, FruitType == \"Apple\" & Year == current_year)\n\n# Calculate the average yield per farmer\naverage_yield_per_farmer <- aggregate(Yield ~ FarmerID, data = apples_current_year, FUN = mean)\n\n# Display the result\nprint(average_yield_per_farmer)\n```\n\nThis code will output a data frame showing the average yield of apples for each farmer for the current year. Note that you need to adjust the `current_year` variable to match the year you are interested in analyzing."
