        "content": "To iterate over the bits of an integer in a Pythonic way, you can use Python's built-in functions along with a list comprehension. The goal is to identify the positions of the bits that are set to `1` and then calculate the value of those bits.\n\nHere's how you can achieve that:\n\n```python\na = 109  # Binary: 1101101\n\n# Iterate over the bits and calculate the power of two for each set bit\nbit_values = [1 << i for i in range(a.bit_length()) if (a & (1 << i))]\n\n# Reverse the list to match the order you want\nbit_values.reverse()\n\nprint(bit_values)  # Output: [64, 32, 8, 4, 1]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`a.bit_length()`**: This gives the number of bits required to represent the number in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros.\n\n2. **`1 << i`**: This is a bitwise operation that shifts `1` to the left by `i` positions, effectively calculating `2^i`.\n\n3. **`a & (1 << i)`**: This checks if the `i`-th bit in `a` is set to `1`.\n\n4. **`[1 << i for i in range(a.bit_length()) if (a & (1 << i))]`**: This list comprehension iterates over all bit positions, and for each bit position that is set to `1`, it calculates its corresponding power of two and includes it in the list.\n\n5. **`bit_values.reverse()`**: Reverses the list to ensure that the values are in descending order, as per your requirement.\n\nThis will give you the list of powers of two corresponding to the positions of the `1` bits in the binary representation of the integer, in descending order."
