I am new to this and after spending a day trying to figure out the most commonly used approach, I've hit a few roadblocks. I've tried to use Sphinx locally and could build a sample demo docs, but I don't understand how to host a searchable solution, like the one on http://www.sphinx-doc.org. I've tried to deploy readthedocs.org locally, but I've encountered issues such as the search not working, inability to build any documentation due to Version not found or Project not found errors, and inability to add a project from my private repository using ssh. I performed these tasks on a Windows machine, which might explain items 1-2, but not 3. Can someone guide me on how to solve these issues and host my documentation privately?"

        "content": "Hosting your documentation privately using tools like Sphinx and ReadTheDocs can be a bit challenging, especially if you're new to the ecosystem. Let's break down your issues and try to address them one by one:\n\n### Using Sphinx Locally\n\n1. **Building and Searching with Sphinx:**\n   - You've successfully built a sample documentation using Sphinx, which is great. To make it searchable like the Sphinx documentation site, ensure you have `sphinx_rtd_theme` (ReadTheDocs theme) and `sphinxcontrib-fulltoc` for enhanced navigation.\n   - Make sure to configure your `conf.py` file correctly. You need to enable the `html_theme = 'sphinx_rtd_theme'` to utilize the ReadTheDocs theme, which provides a search box similar to what ReadTheDocs offers.\n\n2. **Search Functionality:**\n   - Ensure that the `html_search` option is enabled in your `conf.py`. This should be the default, but it's good to confirm.\n   - Sphinx generates a JavaScript-based search index. If you're running the documentation locally, open the `index.html` in a compatible browser, preferably using a local server (`python -m http.server` in the build directory) to ensure all JavaScript functionality works as expected.\n\n### Hosting on ReadTheDocs\n\n1. **Deploying ReadTheDocs Locally:**\n   - Deploying a local instance of ReadTheDocs can be complex, especially on Windows. ReadTheDocs is primarily designed to run on Unix-based systems. Consider using a virtual machine or Docker to create a more compatible environment.\n   - Follow the official ReadTheDocs [development installation guide](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html) closely, which may help resolve the \"search not working\" and other build errors.\n\n2. **Handling 'Version Not Found' and 'Project Not Found' Errors:**\n   - These errors usually occur due to incorrect project configuration or path settings. Ensure your `conf.py` file is correctly configured and paths to your documentation sources are specified correctly.\n   - Check if your ReadTheDocs instance can access your repository. If you're using SSH, your SSH keys need to be properly set up and accessible by the ReadTheDocs service.\n\n3. **Accessing Private Repositories:**\n   - For private repositories, ensure your SSH keys are correctly configured. The SSH key used by the ReadTheDocs instance must have access to the repository.\n   - You might also need to add the SSH key to your SSH agent using `ssh-add` command if it's not already added.\n\n### Alternative Solutions\n\n1. **Docker:**\n   - Consider using Docker to host your documentation. Docker can help you replicate a Unix-like environment on Windows, which may resolve some of the issues you're encountering. There are Docker images available for Sphinx and ReadTheDocs that can simplify this process.\n\n2. **GitHub Pages or GitLab Pages:**\n   - If you're open to using a public hosting service with private repositories, consider using GitHub Pages or GitLab Pages. You can set up your Sphinx documentation to automatically build and deploy to these services.\n\n3. **Self-hosting with a Static Site Generator:**\n   - If you want full control, consider using a static site generator to host the HTML files generated by Sphinx on your own server. Services like Netlify or Vercel can host static sites and provide a private access layer.\n\nBy following these suggestions, you should be able to host your documentation privately and have a fully functional search feature.
