        "content": "A web page is structured using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), which provides the basic framework for how content is displayed in a web browser. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the key components of a web page structure:\n\n1. **DOCTYPE Declaration**: This is the first thing in an HTML document, and it tells the browser what version of HTML the page is written in. For HTML5, it is `<!DOCTYPE html>`.\n\n2. **HTML Element**: This is the root element that wraps all other elements on the page. It is written as `<html>` and contains the `<head>` and `<body>` elements.\n\n3. **Head Element**: The `<head>` section contains meta-information about the document, such as the title, links to stylesheets, character set declarations, and other metadata. Key components include:\n   - `<title>`: Sets the title of the web page, as seen in the browser tab.\n   - `<meta>` tags: Provide metadata such as character set, author, and description.\n   - `<link>` tags: Link to external resources like CSS stylesheets.\n   - `<script>` tags: Can include or link to JavaScript files that need to be loaded before the main content.\n\n4. **Body Element**: The `<body>` section contains all the content that is displayed on the web page, such as text, images, links, and other media. Key elements within the body include:\n   - Text content elements like `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<span>`, and `<div>`.\n   - Media elements like `<img>`, `<video>`, and `<audio>`.\n   - Links and navigation elements like `<a>`, `<nav>`, and `<ul>`.\n   - Form elements like `<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<button>`.\n   - Semantic elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<section>` which help define the structure of the content.\n\n5. **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: While not part of HTML, CSS is used to style the HTML elements and control the layout. CSS can be included in the `<head>` using `<style>` tags or linked externally using `<link>`.\n\n6. **JavaScript**: JavaScript is used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It can be embedded in the HTML using `<script>` tags or linked externally.\n\n7. **Comments**: HTML comments (`<!-- Comment -->`) can be used to leave notes or explanations within the code, which are not displayed in the browser.\n\nThis basic structure forms the backbone of a web page, allowing developers to create complex and interactive websites by leveraging additional technologies like CSS for styling and JavaScript for scripting."
