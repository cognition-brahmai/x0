        "content": "I am attempting to create a simple Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of a data set using NumPy and SciPy. I have two lists of data: one is `y` values and the other is timestamps for those `y` values. I am not sure how to feed these lists into a SciPy or NumPy method and plot the resulting FFT. I have attempted to use the `fft` method from the `scipy.fftpack` module on my dataset and plot the outputs, but I am seeing extremely odd results and suspect that the frequency scaling may be wrong. My code is as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.fftpack import fft\n\n# Number of samplepoints\nN = 600\n\n# Sample spacing\nT = 1.0 / 800.0\nx = np.linspace(0.0, N*T, N)\ny = np.sin(50.0 * 2.0*np.pi*x) + 0.5*np.sin(80.0 * 2.0*np.pi*x)\nyf = fft(y)\nxf = np.linspace(0.0, 1.0/(2.0*T), N/2)\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.plot(xf, 2.0/N * np.abs(yf[0:N/2]))\nplt.grid()\nplt.show()\n```\n\nAnd here is the code I am trying to implement on my actual data:\n\n```python\n## Perform FFT with SciPy\nsignalFFT = fft(yInterp)\n\n## Get power spectral density\nsignalPSD = np.abs(signalFFT) ** 2\n\n## Get frequencies corresponding to signal PSD\nfftFreq = fftfreq(len(signalPSD), spacing)\n\n## Get positive half of frequencies\ni = fftfreq > 0\n\n##\nplt.figurefigsize = (8, 4)\nplt.plot(fftFreq[i], 10*np.log10(signalPSD[i]));\n#plt.xlim(0, 100);\nplt.xlabel('Frequency [Hz]');\nplt.ylabel('PSD [dB]')\n```\nIn this code, spacing is equal to `xInterp[1]-xInterp[0]`. However, when I run it, my FFT plot only has a huge spike at zero and nothing else. You can find my data here: [Data1](http://pastebin.com/0WhjjMkb), [Data2](http://pastebin.com/ksM4FvZS). What am I doing wrong and how can I correct it?"

        "content": "It looks like you're on the right track with your FFT implementation, but there are a few things that need to be addressed to get the expected results. Let's go through your code and make some improvements:\n\n1. **Import Missing Libraries**: Ensure you have imported all necessary libraries, such as `numpy`.\n\n2. **Handling Data**: You need to load your data from the provided links. Ensure that you are reading the data correctly into your `y` and `timestamps` arrays.\n\n3. **FFT Frequency Calculation**: Ensure you are using the correct method to calculate the frequencies using `scipy.fftpack.fftfreq`.\n\n4. **Plotting and Scaling**: Ensure the plotting and scaling are correct.\n\nHere's a revised version of your code with corrections and improvements:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.fftpack import fft, fftfreq\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load your data here\n# Assuming you've loaded the data into y and timestamps lists\n# y = ... (Load your y values)\n# timestamps = ... (Load your timestamps)\n\n# Convert lists to numpy arrays\ny = np.array(y)\ntimestamps = np.array(timestamps)\n\n# Calculate the spacing between samples\nspacing = timestamps[1] - timestamps[0]\n\n# Perform FFT\nsignalFFT = fft(y)\n\n# Get power spectral density\nsignalPSD = np.abs(signalFFT) ** 2\n\n# Get frequencies corresponding to signal PSD\nfftFreq = fftfreq(len(signalPSD), spacing)\n\n# Get positive half of frequencies\ni = fftFreq > 0\n\n# Plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))\nplt.plot(fftFreq[i], 10*np.log10(signalPSD[i]))\nplt.xlabel('Frequency [Hz]')\nplt.ylabel('PSD [dB]')\nplt.title('Power Spectral Density')\nplt.grid()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Key Points to Check:\n\n1. **Data Loading**: Ensure that you are correctly loading your data from the provided links. You might want to use `numpy.loadtxt` or a similar function to read the data into arrays.\n\n2. **Spacing Calculation**: Ensure that the `spacing` is calculated correctly. It is the difference between any two consecutive timestamps.\n\n3. **FFT Frequency Calculation**: Use `scipy.fftpack.fftfreq` to calculate the frequency bins correctly.\n\n4. **Plotting**: Make sure you're plotting only the positive frequency components and converting the power spectral density to decibels for better visualization.\n\nIf these corrections don't resolve your issue, please ensure that the data is correctly loaded and that the timestamps are accurate. You might also want to inspect your data for any anomalies to ensure it is what you expect before processing it with FFT."
