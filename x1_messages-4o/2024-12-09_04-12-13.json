        "content": "I am working on a security system in Python that denies access to unauthorized users. I am trying to compare an input value against multiple values using an \"or\" logical operator. However, my code seems to always evaluate to True, and even unauthorized users are being granted access. Here is the code I have written:\n\n```python\nname = input(\"Hello. Please enter your name: \")\nif name == \"Kevin\" or \"Jon\" or \"Inbar\":\n    print(\"Access granted.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Access denied.\")\n```\n\nWhen I test this with a name not in the list, like \"Bob\", the output is \"Access granted.\" Why is this happening? I thought my condition clearly states that access should only be granted when the name equals \"Kevin\", \"Jon\", or \"Inbar\". I have also tried reversing the logic like this: `if \"Kevin\" or \"Jon\" or \"Inbar\" == name`, but the result is still the same."

        "content": "The issue lies in the way you are using the `or` operator in your condition. In the expression `name == \"Kevin\" or \"Jon\" or \"Inbar\"`, Python evaluates each part separately. Here's how it interprets it:\n\n1. `name == \"Kevin\"`: This part checks if the `name` is equal to `\"Kevin\"`.\n2. `\"Jon\"`: This is a non-empty string, which is always considered `True` in a boolean context.\n3. `\"Inbar\"`: Similarly, this is also a non-empty string, so it is always `True`.\n\nSince `\"Jon\"` and `\"Inbar\"` are always `True`, the entire expression evaluates to `True`, granting access regardless of the input.\n\nTo fix this, you need to compare the `name` variable against each of the values separately. Here's the corrected code:\n\n```python\nname = input(\"Hello. Please enter your name: \")\nif name == \"Kevin\" or name == \"Jon\" or name == \"Inbar\":\n    print(\"Access granted.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Access denied.\")\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `in` operator with a tuple or list to make the code cleaner:\n\n```python\nname = input(\"Hello. Please enter your name: \")\nif name in (\"Kevin\", \"Jon\", \"Inbar\"):\n    print(\"Access granted.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Access denied.\")\n```\n\nBoth of these approaches will correctly restrict access to only those names specified in the list."
