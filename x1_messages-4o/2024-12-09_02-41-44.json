While trying to compile it from sources following instructions from the static linking section on this site [http://lxml.de/build.html], I encounter an error. The error message displayed is \"'xslt-config' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file\" and it also states \"Unable to find vcvarsall.bat\". I have attempted setting the path to include Microsoft Visual Studio and I can run vcvarsall.bat from the command line, but Python still encounters problems. Can anyone assist me with this issue?"

        "content": "Building `lxml` for Python 2.7 on a Windows 64-bit machine can be quite challenging, especially since it involves dealing with dependencies like `libxml2` and `libxslt`. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you resolve the issues you're facing:\n\n### Prerequisites:\n\n1. **Python 2.7**: Ensure Python 2.7 is installed on your system. Make sure to download the 64-bit version if you're building for a 64-bit machine.\n\n2. **Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7**: Download and install this from Microsoft's website. This provides the necessary tools to compile Python extensions.\n\n3. **Dependencies**: You need `libxml2` and `libxslt` libraries. You can download precompiled binaries or compile them yourself.\n\n### Steps to Build lxml:\n\n1. **Install Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7**: This compiler is tailored for Python 2.7 and should provide the `vcvarsall.bat` script you need.\n\n2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:\n   - Open a command prompt and run the following command to set up the environment for the Visual C++ compiler:\n     ```shell\n     \"C:\\Path\\To\\VC\\vcvarsall.bat\" x64\n     ```\n   - Ensure that your `PATH` environment variable includes the paths to `libxml2` and `libxslt` binaries and libraries.\n\n3. **Download and Extract lxml Source**:\n   - Download the lxml source code from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/lxml/).\n   - Extract the source code to a directory.\n\n4. **Modify Setup Configuration**:\n   - Navigate to the directory where you extracted lxml.\n   - Open the `setup.py` file and ensure that the paths to `libxml2` and `libxslt` are correctly specified.\n\n5. **Use Static Linking**:\n   - Follow the instructions for static linking on the lxml website, making sure that you have all the necessary `.lib` and `.dll` files for `libxml2` and `libxslt`.\n   - You may need to adjust the `setup.py` to properly link these libraries.\n\n6. **Build lxml**:\n   - Run the following command in the command prompt:\n     ```shell\n     python setup.py build\n     ```\n   - If everything is set up correctly, this should compile the `lxml` module.\n\n7. **Install lxml**:\n   - If the build is successful, install the compiled module using:\n     ```shell\n     python setup.py install\n     ```\n\n### Troubleshooting:\n\n- **'xslt-config' Not Recognized**: This is typically a Unix-specific tool, so ensure you\u2019re using the Windows equivalents and have the necessary paths set correctly.\n\n- **Unable to Find vcvarsall.bat**: Double-check that you\u2019ve installed the Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7 and that the paths are correctly set in your environment variables.\n\n- **Consider Using Precompiled Binaries**: If you continue to face issues, consider searching for precompiled `lxml` Windows binaries compatible with Python 2.7.\n\nBy ensuring all dependencies are correctly installed and environment variables are set, you should be able to successfully build `lxml` for Python 2.7 on your Windows machine."
