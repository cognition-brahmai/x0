I attempted to include the ampersand (&) at the end of the command but it just hangs. The exact form of the command I am using is:\n```\nssh user@target \"cd /some/directory; program-to-execute &\"\n```\nI have SSH keys set up so no password is required and logins to the target machine always produce a text banner."

        "content": "When you execute a command over SSH and you want it to run in the background on the remote machine, there are a few things to consider. The SSH session will wait for the command to finish by default, even if you use `&` to run it in the background. This is because the remote shell is waiting for all its child processes to terminate.\n\nTo run a command in the background and have your SSH session return immediately, you can use `nohup` along with redirecting input and output streams. `nohup` allows the command to continue running after you've logged out.\n\nHere is the modified command:\n\n```bash\nssh user@target \"cd /some/directory; nohup program-to-execute > output.log 2>&1 < /dev/null &\"\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `nohup` allows the command to continue running in the background after the SSH session is closed.\n- `> output.log` redirects standard output to a file named `output.log`.\n- `2>&1` redirects standard error to standard output, so both are captured in `output.log`.\n- `< /dev/null` redirects standard input from `/dev/null`, which effectively disconnects the command from the terminal session.\n- `&` runs the command in the background.\n\nThis setup should allow your SSH command to return immediately while the remote process continues to run."
