        "content": "To determine the heaviest ball among 8 balls with only 2 weighings, you can use a strategic approach that involves dividing the balls into groups. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **First Weighing:**\n   - Divide the 8 balls into three groups: two groups of 3 balls each and one group of 2 balls. Let's label them as Group A, Group B, and Group C, where Group C has only 2 balls.\n   - Weigh Group A against Group B.\n\n2. **Analyze the First Weighing:**\n   - If Group A is heavier than Group B, the heaviest ball is in Group A.\n   - If Group B is heavier than Group A, the heaviest ball is in Group B.\n   - If both groups are balanced, the heaviest ball is in Group C.\n\n3. **Second Weighing:**\n   - Depending on the result of the first weighing, take the group that was determined to have the heaviest ball (either Group A or Group B, or Group C if they were balanced) and compare two of the balls from this group.\n   - For example, if Group A was heavier, weigh two of the balls from Group A against each other.\n   - If one is heavier, you've found the heaviest ball.\n   - If they balance out, then the ball not being weighed from that group is the heaviest.\n\nBy strategically dividing and weighing the groups, you efficiently identify the heaviest ball in just two weighings."
