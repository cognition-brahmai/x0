        "content": "The `dict_keys` object in Python 3 is a view object that provides a dynamic view on the dictionary\u2019s keys and does not support indexing or direct access by index. However, you can convert it to a list or use an iterator to access elements by index. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Using `list()` Conversion\n\nConvert the `dict_keys` object to a list and then access the element by index:\n\n```python\ntest = {'foo': 'bar', 'hello': 'world'}\nkeys = test.keys()  # dict_keys object\n\n# Convert to a list\nkeys_list = list(keys)\n\n# Access the first element\nfirst_key = keys_list[0]\nprint(first_key)  # Output: 'foo'\n```\n\n### Using `next()` with `iter()`\n\nAlternatively, you can use an iterator to access the elements. This is more memory efficient if you only need a specific element and do not require the entire list:\n\n```python\ntest = {'foo': 'bar', 'hello': 'world'}\nkeys = test.keys()  # dict_keys object\n\n# Get an iterator\nkeys_iterator = iter(keys)\n\n# Access the first element using next()\nfirst_key = next(keys_iterator)\nprint(first_key)  # Output: 'foo'\n```\n\nBoth methods will allow you to access the key `'foo'` by its index position in the dictionary keys."
