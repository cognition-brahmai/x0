Currently, I am using the following code:\n\n```python\nif key not in d.keys():\n    d[key] = value\n```\n\nIs there a more efficient or pythonic way to solve this problem?"

You can use the `setdefault` method of a dictionary. This method is designed to handle exactly this situation. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nd.setdefault(key, value)\n```\n\nThe `setdefault` method checks if the key is present in the dictionary. If the key is not present, it inserts the key with the specified value. If the key is already present, it does nothing and returns the current value associated with the key. This approach is concise and avoids an explicit conditional check."
