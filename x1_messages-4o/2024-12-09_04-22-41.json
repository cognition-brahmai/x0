        "content": "To include foreign key references in the dictionary representation of your Django model instance, you need to manually include those fields in the dictionary. The `model_to_dict` function only converts the fields directly on the model instance, not the related fields through foreign keys.\n\nHere's how you can modify your approach to include foreign key fields:\n\n1. **Manually access foreign key fields:**\n\n   You can manually add the foreign key fields to the dictionary by accessing them on the model instance. Here's an example:\n\n   ```python\n   from django.forms.models import model_to_dict\n\n   def model_to_dict_with_fk(instance, fields=[], exclude=[]):\n       # Create a base dictionary with the direct fields\n       data = model_to_dict(instance, fields=fields, exclude=exclude)\n\n       # Manually add foreign key fields\n       for field in instance._meta.fields:\n           if field.is_relation and field.many_to_one:\n               related_instance = getattr(instance, field.name)\n               if related_instance:\n                   data[field.name] = related_instance.pk  # or any field you want from the related instance\n\n       return data\n   ```\n\n2. **Recursive Conversion:**\n\n   If you want to go deeper and convert the related objects into dictionaries as well, you could recursively call your conversion function on the related objects:\n\n   ```python\n   def model_to_dict_with_fk_recursive(instance, fields=[], exclude=[], depth=1):\n       if depth < 0:\n           return None\n\n       # Create a base dictionary with the direct fields\n       data = model_to_dict(instance, fields=fields, exclude=exclude)\n\n       # Manually add foreign key fields\n       for field in instance._meta.fields:\n           if field.is_relation and field.many_to_one:\n               related_instance = getattr(instance, field.name)\n               if related_instance:\n                   data[field.name] = model_to_dict_with_fk_recursive(\n                       related_instance, fields=[], exclude=[], depth=depth-1\n                   )\n\n       return data\n   ```\n\n   In this recursive approach, the `depth` parameter controls how deep you want to go into the related objects. Setting `depth=1` will include only direct foreign key references, while increasing the depth will go further into nested relationships.\n\nBy using one of these methods, you can customize your dictionary representation to include foreign key relationships as desired."
