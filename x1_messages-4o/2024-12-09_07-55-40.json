        "content": "To ensure that all subclasses of a base class like \"Polygon\" implement specific methods such as \"perimeter\" and \"area,\" you can use an `abstract base class` in Python by utilizing the `abc` module. The `abc` module allows you to define abstract methods, which must be implemented by any subclass. Here's how you can enforce the implementation of these methods:\n\n```python\nfrom abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n\nclass Polygon(ABC):\n    @abstractmethod\n    def perimeter(self):\n        pass\n\n    @abstractmethod\n    def area(self):\n        pass\n\nclass Triangle(Polygon):\n    def perimeter(self):\n        return 3  # Example placeholder implementation\n\n    def area(self):\n        return 1.5  # Example placeholder implementation\n\n# This will raise an error because 'area' is not implemented\nclass IncompletePolygon(Polygon):\n    def perimeter(self):\n        return 0  # Example placeholder implementation\n\n# Testing\ntriangle = Triangle()\nprint(triangle.perimeter())  # Output: 3\nprint(triangle.area())       # Output: 1.5\n\n# Attempting to instantiate IncompletePolygon will raise a TypeError\n# because it doesn't implement the 'area' method.\ntry:\n    incomplete_polygon = IncompletePolygon()\nexcept TypeError as e:\n    print(e)  # Output: Can't instantiate abstract class IncompletePolygon with abstract methods area\n```\n\nIn this example, `Polygon` is declared as an abstract base class by inheriting from `ABC`. The `@abstractmethod` decorator is used to mark `perimeter` and `area` as abstract methods. Any subclass of `Polygon` must implement these methods, or else it cannot be instantiated, and attempting to do so will raise a `TypeError`. This ensures that your colleagues or anyone else using the class will be reminded to implement these methods, maintaining consistency across the subclasses."
