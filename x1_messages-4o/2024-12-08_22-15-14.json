Can you provide an example code?\nFor instance, let's consider the following equation:\nAx = b\nwhere A is a 2x2 matrix, x is a column vector of length 2, and b is another column vector of length 2.\nTo typeset this equation in Latex, we can use the following code:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n    a_{11} & a_{12} \\\\\n    a_{21} & a_{22} \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n    x_1 \\\\\n    x_2 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n    b_1 \\\\\n    b_2 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThis will produce a typeset version of the equation that involves matrices and vectors."

        "content": "Certainly! LaTeX is a powerful tool for typesetting mathematical equations, including those involving matrices and vectors. You've provided a perfect example of how to represent the equation \\( Ax = b \\) using LaTeX. Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n```latex\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n    a_{11} & a_{12} \\\\\n    a_{21} & a_{22} \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n    x_1 \\\\\n    x_2 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n    b_1 \\\\\n    b_2 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **\\[ ... \\]**: This is used to display the equation in a centered, standalone block. It is equivalent to using `\\begin{equation*} ... \\end{equation*}` but without numbering.\n\n- **\\begin{bmatrix} ... \\end{bmatrix}**: This environment is used to create matrices with square brackets. \n\n- **&**: This symbol is used to separate columns within the matrix.\n\n- **\\\\**: This command is used to indicate the end of a row within the matrix.\n\n### Steps to Typeset:\n\n1. **Matrix A**: \n    - The first `bmatrix` environment contains the elements of matrix \\( A \\). It is a 2x2 matrix with elements \\( a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{21}, \\) and \\( a_{22} \\).\n\n2. **Vector x**:\n    - The second `bmatrix` environment represents the column vector \\( x \\) with elements \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\).\n\n3. **Vector b**:\n    - The third `bmatrix` environment represents the column vector \\( b \\) with elements \\( b_1 \\) and \\( b_2 \\).\n\nWhen compiled with LaTeX, this code will render a nicely formatted equation depicting the matrix-vector multiplication resulting in another vector. \n\nIf you need further customization, such as adding more rows or columns, you can expand the matrices and vectors accordingly by adding more elements and separating them with `&` for columns and `\\\\` for rows."
