        "content": "The error you're encountering indicates that the NVVM (NVIDIA's CUDA Compiler) library cannot be found. This is likely due to an incomplete or improperly configured installation of the CUDA toolkit. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify CUDA Toolkit Installation:**\n   Make sure that the CUDA toolkit is properly installed. You can do this by checking the version and ensuring the environment paths are set correctly. Run the following command to check if `nvcc` is accessible:\n\n   ```bash\n   nvcc --version\n   ```\n\n   If it\u2019s not found, you may need to install or reinstall the CUDA toolkit.\n\n2. **Install CUDA Toolkit via Conda:**\n   Since you are using conda, it is often easier to manage dependencies through it. Ensure you have the CUDA toolkit installed via conda:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda install cudatoolkit\n   ```\n\n   This should install the necessary components, including `libNVVM`.\n\n3. **Set Environment Variables:**\n   Ensure that the environment variables are set correctly. You might need to add the CUDA library paths to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. You can do this by adding the following lines to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH\n   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n   ```\n\n   Replace `/usr/local/cuda` with the path to your CUDA toolkit installation if it's different.\n\n4. **Check Compatibility:**\n   Ensure that the versions of CUDA, Numba, and your Nvidia drivers are compatible with each other. Numba requires specific versions of CUDA, and you can check its compatibility in the [Numba documentation](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/cuda/index.html).\n\n5. **Reinstall Numba:**\n   Sometimes, the issue could be with the Numba installation itself. Try reinstalling it:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda install numba\n   ```\n\n6. **Verify GPU Compatibility:**\n   Make sure that your GPUs (GTX 1070 and GTX 1060) are supported by the version of CUDA you are using.\n\n7. **Test with a Simple CUDA Program:**\n   Try running a simple CUDA program to verify that the CUDA environment is working correctly.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the \"libNVVM cannot be found\" error and successfully run your code. If the issue persists, you may want to consider upgrading your Ubuntu version as 17.04 is quite old and may have compatibility issues with newer software."
