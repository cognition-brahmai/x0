They both seem to be used for executing and waiting for multiple asynchronous tasks, but they have different syntax and details. It seems un-pythonic to have two functions with such large functionality overlap. Could you explain the differences?"

        "content": "`asyncio.gather` and `asyncio.wait` are both used to handle multiple asynchronous tasks in Python, but they serve slightly different purposes and have different behaviors. Here's a breakdown of their differences:\n\n### `asyncio.gather`\n\n- **Purpose**: `asyncio.gather` is used to run multiple asynchronous operations concurrently and collect their results. It is designed to be user-friendly when you need to execute multiple coroutines and gather their results in the same order as they were started.\n  \n- **Result**: It returns a single future that aggregates the results of all the provided coroutines. The results are returned as a list in the same order as the coroutines are passed.\n\n- **Exception Handling**: If any of the tasks raises an exception, `asyncio.gather` will propagate the first exception it encounters. By default, it will cancel all the remaining tasks if one of them fails, but you can control this behavior using the `return_exceptions` parameter. If `return_exceptions` is set to `True`, exceptions are treated as results and are returned in their respective place in the results list.\n\n- **Use Case**: Ideal for when you need all tasks to complete and require their results or when you want to handle exceptions for each task individually.\n\n```python\nresults = await asyncio.gather(task1(), task2(), task3(), return_exceptions=True)\n```\n\n### `asyncio.wait`\n\n- **Purpose**: `asyncio.wait` is more flexible and lower-level than `asyncio.gather`. It allows you to wait for tasks to complete based on different conditions like waiting for all tasks to finish, or waiting for the first task to finish.\n\n- **Result**: It returns two sets of futures: one for completed tasks and one for pending tasks. You don't get the results directly; you need to iterate over the completed futures to retrieve their results.\n\n- **Exception Handling**: Exceptions raised in tasks are not automatically propagated; they need to be explicitly checked by iterating over the completed futures.\n\n- **Options**: You can specify the `return_when` parameter to control when `asyncio.wait` returns. Options include `FIRST_COMPLETED`, `FIRST_EXCEPTION`, and `ALL_COMPLETED`.\n\n- **Use Case**: Useful when you need more control over task execution and completion criteria, such as when you want to handle tasks as they complete or stop after the first task finishes.\n\n```python\ndone, pending = await asyncio.wait([task1(), task2(), task3()], return_when=asyncio.FIRST_COMPLETED)\n```\n\n### Summary\n\n- Use `asyncio.gather` when you want to run tasks concurrently and retrieve their results in order. It's simpler and more straightforward for most use cases where you need results from all tasks.\n- Use `asyncio.wait` when you need more control over the task execution, such as waiting for tasks to complete based on specific criteria and handling them as they complete.\n\nBoth functions are valuable in different scenarios, and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements of your asynchronous workflow."
