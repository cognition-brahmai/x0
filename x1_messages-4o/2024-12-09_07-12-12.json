The input list is 4.3M utf-8 strings, sorted lexicographically which results in a graph that is acyclic and has a maximum depth of 638 nodes. My script sets the recursion limit to 1100 using `sys.setrecursionlimit()`. However, I am facing a problem when I want to serialize my trie to disk using `pickle.dump()` and `cPickle.dump()`. Each time, I get a RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded. Here is the stack-trace:\n\n```python\nFile \"/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/pickle.py\", line 649, in save_dict\n    self._batch_setitems(obj.iteritems())\n  File \"/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/pickle.py\", line 663, in _batch_setitems\n    save(v)\n  File \"/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/pickle.py\", line 286, in save\n    f(self, obj) # Call unbound method with explicit self\n  File \"/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/pickle.py\", line 725, in save_inst\n    save(stuff)\n  File \"/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/pickle.py\", line 286, in save\n    f(self, obj) # Call unbound method with explicit self\n  File \"/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/pickle.py\", line 648, in save_dict\n    self.memoize(obj)\nRuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded\n```\n\nMy data structures are simple: `trie` contains a reference to a start state and defines some methods. `dfa_state` contains a boolean field, a string field, and a dictionary mapping from label to state. I am not very familiar with the inner workings of `pickle`, hence I am unsure whether my max recursion depth needs to be greater/equal n times the depth of the trie for some n, or could this be caused by something else I am unaware of? Increasing the recursion depth to 3000 didn't help. Any advice on how to solve this issue would be appreciated."

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with `pickle` is due to the recursive nature of the serialization process, which hits Python's recursion limit. This is especially problematic with deeply nested data structures like your trie.\n\nHere are a few strategies to address and potentially solve the problem:\n\n1. **Iterative Serialization:**\n   Instead of relying on the default recursive approach of `pickle`, you could implement a custom serialization method that processes the trie iteratively. This involves traversing the trie using a stack or queue, which avoids the deep recursion problem.\n\n2. **Increase Recursion Limit:**\n   Although you mentioned increasing the recursion limit to 3000 didn't help, it's possible that further increasing it might. However, this isn't a scalable or reliable solution, especially if your data structure grows larger in the future.\n\n3. **Use an Alternative Serialization Library:**\n   Libraries like `dill` or `joblib` can serialize more complex objects and may handle deep recursion better than `pickle`. You can try using these libraries as they might be more efficient in handling your trie structure:\n   ```python\n   import dill\n\n   with open('trie.dill', 'wb') as f:\n       dill.dump(trie, f)\n   ```\n\n4. **Flatten the Trie:**\n   Consider flattening your trie structure for serialization. You can convert the trie into a list of edges or a similar flat structure that doesn't rely on deep nesting. Once flattened, this structure can be serialized more easily and then reconstructed when deserialized.\n\n5. **Custom Reduce Method:**\n   Implement the `__reduce__` method in your classes to customize how they are pickled. This can help control the serialization process and potentially reduce recursion depth by breaking down the object into simpler parts.\n\n6. **Break Down the Trie:**\n   If possible, break the trie into smaller sub-tries, serialize them independently, and then combine them during deserialization. This reduces the depth of recursion needed for any single serialization operation.\n\n7. **Debugging with Smaller Data:**\n   Test serialization with a smaller subset of your data to isolate the problem and understand its behavior. This could help in identifying specific areas where recursion depth is exceeded.\n\nTry implementing one or a combination of these strategies to alleviate the recursion depth issue you're experiencing."
