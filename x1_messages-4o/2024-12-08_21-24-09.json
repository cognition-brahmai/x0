Let's find the prime number for each letter in the word:\n\n1. P is the 16th letter of the alphabet, and the 16th prime number is 53.\n2. Y is the 25th letter of the alphabet, and the 25th prime number is 97.\n3. T is the 20th letter of the alphabet, and the 20th prime number is 71.\n4. H is the 8th letter of the alphabet, and the 8th prime number is 19.\n5. A is the 1st letter of the alphabet, and the 1st prime number is 2.\n6. G is the 7th letter of the alphabet, and the 7th prime number is 17.\n7. O is the 15th letter of the alphabet, and the 15th prime number is 47.\n8. R is the 18th letter of the alphabet, and the 18th prime number is 61.\n9. E is the 5th letter of the alphabet, and the 5th prime number is 11.\n10. A is the 1st letter of the alphabet, and the 1st prime number is 2.\n11. N is the 14th letter of the alphabet, and the 14th prime number is 43.\n\nNow, let's put these together to form the resulting code:\n\nPYTHAGOREAN = 53 97 71 19 2 17 47 61 11 2 43\n\nTherefore, the code for the word \"PYTHAGOREAN\" is 53 97 71 19 2 17 47 61 11 2 43."
