I am using `Tkinter.Label` because `Tkinter.Listbox` does not allow for newlines. I am trying to get the text of a Tkinter label but I am not finding a `.get()`-like method in the Label class. I am aware that I can use `StringVar()`, like the following code:\n\n```python\nv = StringVar()\nLabel(master, textvariable=v).pack()\nv.set(\"New Text!\")\n...\nprint v.get()\n```\n\nHowever, keeping a separate array of `StringVar()`'s will be difficult as I have a list of 5-20 addresses and I don't have a way of identifying the location of the active label. I would prefer to access the activated widget contents directly. Is `Tkinter.Label` the right widget to be using in this case?"

        "content": "In your case, using `Tkinter.Label` for displaying a list of selectable addresses isn't the most convenient approach, as you've discovered. `Tkinter.Label` widgets are primarily used for displaying static text and don't have interactive or selection capabilities. While you can use `StringVar()` to manage the text, handling user selections can become cumbersome.\n\nInstead, you might consider using `Tkinter.Listbox`, which is designed for displaying a list of selectable items. Although it doesn't directly support newlines within items, you can format the addresses to fit within a single line, or use tooltips or a separate display area to show the complete address when an item is selected.\n\nHere's a suggestion on how you might approach this with a `Tkinter.Listbox`:\n\n1. **Use a Listbox for Selection:** Display the addresses in a `Listbox`. Even though the addresses are single-lined, you can provide additional details elsewhere when an address is selected.\n\n2. **Display Details Separately:** Use another `Label` or `Text` widget to show the full address details when a list item is clicked.\n\nHere's a simple implementation:\n\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\n\ndef on_select(event):\n    # Get selected index\n    index = listbox.curselection()\n    if not index:\n        return\n    # Fetch the selected address\n    selected_address = addresses[index[0]]\n    # Display the full address\n    detail_label.config(text=selected_address)\n\n# Sample addresses\naddresses = [\n    \"123 Main St, Springfield, IL\",\n    \"456 Elm St, Springfield, IL\",\n    \"789 Oak St, Springfield, IL\"\n]\n\n# Create the main window\nroot = tk.Tk()\nroot.title(\"Address Selector\")\n\n# Create a Listbox\nlistbox = tk.Listbox(root, height=10, width=50)\nlistbox.pack()\n\n# Insert addresses into the Listbox\nfor address in addresses:\n    listbox.insert(tk.END, address.split(',')[0])  # Display only the first part\n\n# Bind the select event\nlistbox.bind('<<ListboxSelect>>', on_select)\n\n# Label to display full address details\ndetail_label = tk.Label(root, text=\"\", wraplength=300)\ndetail_label.pack(pady=10)\n\n# Run the application\nroot.mainloop()\n```\n\nIn this setup, the `Listbox` allows for simple selection, and the `detail_label` updates to show the full address when an item is selected. This way, you can manage user selections more efficiently."
