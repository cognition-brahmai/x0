Specifically, I want to find pairs like (\"car\", \"arc\"). I have attempted to write code which loops over the list and compares pairs of strings, but I'm having trouble accounting for the fact that the letters can be in different orders. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To efficiently group anagrams from a list of words in Python, a good approach is to use a dictionary to map the sorted tuple of characters as keys to lists of words that are anagrams. By sorting the characters in each word, you can easily determine if two words are anagrams because anagrams will have identical sorted character sequences. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n```python\ndef group_anagrams(words):\n    anagrams = {}\n\n    for word in words:\n        # Sort the word into a tuple of characters\n        sorted_word = tuple(sorted(word))\n        \n        # Use the sorted tuple as a key in the dictionary\n        if sorted_word in anagrams:\n            anagrams[sorted_word].append(word)\n        else:\n            anagrams[sorted_word] = [word]\n\n    # Return the dictionary values as a list of lists\n    return list(anagrams.values())\n\n# Example usage\nwords = [\"car\", \"tree\", \"boy\", \"girl\", \"arc\"]\nanagram_groups = group_anagrams(words)\n\n# Print pairs of anagrams\nfor group in anagram_groups:\n    if len(group) > 1:\n        print(group)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `group_anagrams` that takes a list of words and returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains words that are anagrams of each other. In your example, it would output:\n\n```\n['car', 'arc']\n```\n\nThis indicates that \"car\" and \"arc\" are anagrams. The function works by:\n\n1. Initializing an empty dictionary to store the anagram groups.\n2. Iterating over each word in the given list.\n3. Sorting the characters in the word and using that sorted tuple as a key in the dictionary.\n4. Appending the word to the corresponding list in the dictionary.\n5. Converting the dictionary values, which are lists of anagrams, to a list of lists and returning it.\n\nThis method efficiently groups words that are anagrams together."
