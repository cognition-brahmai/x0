        "content": "Upgrading `pip` for Python 3.5 can sometimes be tricky, especially since Python 3.5 is an older version and may not be supported by the latest version of `pip`. However, you can try the following steps to upgrade `pip3` for Python 3.5:\n\n1. **Upgrade pip using the `get-pip.py` script:**\n\n   You can use the `get-pip.py` script to install the latest version of `pip` that is compatible with Python 3.5. Here's how you can do it:\n\n   - First, download the `get-pip.py` script. You can do this using `curl` or `wget`:\n\n     ```bash\n     curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/3.5/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py\n     ```\n\n     or\n\n     ```bash\n     wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/3.5/get-pip.py\n     ```\n\n   - Once downloaded, run the script using Python 3.5:\n\n     ```bash\n     python3.5 get-pip.py\n     ```\n\n   This should install or upgrade `pip` for Python 3.5 to the latest compatible version.\n\n2. **Ensure you are using the correct pip version:**\n\n   If you have multiple versions of Python installed, make sure you are using the `pip` that corresponds to Python 3.5. You can specify the exact version by using `pip3.5`:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.5 -m pip install --upgrade pip\n   ```\n\n3. **Check your PATH environment variable:**\n\n   Make sure that the path to the Python 3.5 installation is correctly set in your PATH environment variable. This ensures that the correct `pip` version is used when you invoke the `pip` command.\n\n4. **Use a virtual environment:**\n\n   If you are not already using virtual environments, consider creating one. This can help manage dependencies and package versions more effectively:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.5 -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n   python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n   ```\n\n   This will create a virtual environment with the appropriate version of `pip` for Python 3.5.\n\nIf these steps do not resolve the issue, check for any specific error messages that are displayed during the upgrade process, as they might provide more insight into what's going wrong. Additionally, consider whether it's feasible to upgrade your Python version to a more recent one that has better support for modern libraries and tools."
