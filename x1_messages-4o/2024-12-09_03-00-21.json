I need to add \"Testing Environment\" to the subject line of the email if the IP address is 192.168.100.37, which is our testing server. I found a piece of code using `socket` module which is supposed to get the IP address, but it's giving me 127.0.1.1 instead. When I use `ifconfig`, I get the IP address as 192.168.100.37 for eth0. How can I get the IP address of eth0 using Python, preferably using standard libraries?"

        "content": "To obtain the IP address associated with a specific network interface, such as `eth0`, in Python, you can utilize the `socket` and `fcntl` modules. The `socket` module is part of the standard library, but `fcntl` is specific to Unix-like systems, so make sure your script runs in such an environment.\n\nHere's a Python snippet that demonstrates how to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport socket\nimport fcntl\nimport struct\n\ndef get_interface_ip(ifname):\n    # Create a socket\n    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)\n    \n    # Use fcntl to make an ioctl call to fetch the IP address\n    # SIOCGIFADDR is a constant representing the command for getting the IP address\n    # The '256' is a buffer size that should be sufficient for a typical interface name\n    try:\n        IP = fcntl.ioctl(\n            sock.fileno(),\n            0x8915,  # SIOCGIFADDR\n            struct.pack('256s', ifname[:15].encode('utf-8'))\n        )[20:24]\n        return socket.inet_ntoa(IP)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Could not get IP for interface {ifname}: {e}\")\n        return None\n\n# Usage example\neth0_ip = get_interface_ip('eth0')\nif eth0_ip:\n    print(f\"The IP address for eth0 is: {eth0_ip}\")\n    \n    # Check if this is the testing environment\n    if eth0_ip == '192.168.100.37':\n        subject = \"Testing Environment\"\n    else:\n        subject = \"Production Environment\"\n    \n    print(f\"Subject: {subject}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Failed to retrieve IP address for eth0.\")\n```\n\nHere's how this works:\n- We create a socket using `socket.socket()`.\n- We use the `fcntl.ioctl()` function to perform an ioctl system call to fetch the IP address associated with the specified interface (`eth0` in this case).\n- The `struct.pack()` function is used to prepare the interface name for the ioctl call.\n\nThis script should give you the IP address for the `eth0` interface. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to run this script, and that you test it on a Unix-like system, as `fcntl` is not available on Windows."
