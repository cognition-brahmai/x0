        "content": "The error you're encountering, `TypeError: 'module' object is not callable`, typically occurs when you try to call a module as if it were a function or class. In your case, the error is happening because the `socket` module is being used incorrectly.\n\nIn your code, the line `self.serv = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)` is attempting to call `socket` directly, which is a module, not a function or a class. Instead, you should be calling the `socket` class within the `socket` module.\n\nHere's how you can fix the issue:\n\n```python\nimport socket\n\n# Correct usage\nself.serv = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `socket` with `socket.socket` to correctly create a socket object. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the changes:\n\n- `socket` is the module you imported.\n- `socket.socket` is the class within the module that you need to instantiate to create a socket object.\n- `AF_INET` and `SOCK_STREAM` are constants in the `socket` module, which you should reference as `socket.AF_INET` and `socket.SOCK_STREAM`.\n\nThis should resolve the `TypeError` and allow your program to run without encountering that particular error."
