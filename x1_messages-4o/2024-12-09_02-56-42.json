Currently, I am using the following code to save the webpage, but it only saves the basic HTML without additional components. How can I modify this to save the entire webpage as we do in a browser?\n\nCode:\n```python\nimport urllib\nimport sys\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\nurl = 'http://www.vodafone.de/privat/tarife/red-smartphone-tarife.html'\nf = urllib.urlretrieve(url,'test.html')\n```\nAdditionally, I tried to save all the JavaScript, images and CSS files of the webpage, however, my output HTML is still getting saved as basic HTML. Here's the updated code I'm using:\n\n```python\nimport pycurl\nimport StringIO\n\nc = pycurl.Curl()\nc.setopt(pycurl.URL, \"http://www.vodafone.de/privat/tarife/red-smartphone-tarife.html\")\n\nb = StringIO.StringIO()\nc.setopt(pycurl.WRITEFUNCTION, b.write)\nc.setopt(pycurl.FOLLOWLOCATION, 1)\nc.setopt(pycurl.MAXREDIRS, 5)\nc.perform()\nhtml = b.getvalue()\n#print html\nfh = open(\"file.html\", \"w\")\nfh.write(html)\nfh.close()\n```"

        "content": "To save a complete webpage, including JavaScript, images, and CSS, you can use a library like `requests` to download the HTML, and `BeautifulSoup` to parse it, but you\u2019ll also need to download each resource separately. To make this process easier, you can use `wget` or `httrack` to mirror the website, or you can use a Python library like `pywebcopy` that handles downloading all resources for you.\n\nHere's an example using `pywebcopy`:\n\n1. First, install `pywebcopy`:\n   ```bash\n   pip install pywebcopy\n   ```\n\n2. Use `pywebcopy` to download the complete webpage:\n   ```python\n   from pywebcopy import save_webpage\n\n   url = 'http://www.vodafone.de/privat/tarife/red-smartphone-tarife.html'\n   download_folder = '/path/to/download/folder'\n\n   # Save the complete webpage including all resources\n   save_webpage(url, download_folder, open_in_browser=False)\n   ```\n\nThis will save the entire webpage, including all JavaScript, CSS, and image files, into the specified folder.\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **`pywebcopy`** is a Python library designed to download websites, including all associated resources like images, CSS, and JavaScript.\n\n- You can specify the `download_folder` where all the files will be stored.\n\n- The `save_webpage` function handles fetching and saving all resources, so you don't need to manually parse and download each component.\n\nThis method is straightforward and efficient for saving entire webpages just as you would do using the \"Save As\" function in a browser."
