CUDA 5.0 does support GPUs with compute capability 1.1, so you should not encounter any issues using CUDA 5.0 with your GPU. However, it's important to note that while CUDA 5.0 will work with compute capability 1.1, some newer features and optimizations available in later CUDA versions may not be supported on older hardware with lower compute capabilities. This means you might not be able to take full advantage of all the improvements made in CUDA 5.0. Nonetheless, for basic CUDA programming tasks, you should be fine with your current setup."
