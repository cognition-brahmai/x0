        "content": "Your SQL query is almost correct, but it needs a small adjustment to ensure that you only retrieve exactly three synonyms for each noun. You can achieve this by using a subquery to limit the number of synonyms per noun before applying the `GROUP_CONCAT`. Here's how you can modify the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT noun, GROUP_CONCAT(synonym ORDER BY synonym LIMIT 3 SEPARATOR ', ') AS synonyms\nFROM (\n    SELECT noun, synonym,\n           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY noun ORDER BY synonym) as rn\n    FROM words\n    WHERE category = 'space'\n) AS subquery\nWHERE rn <= 3\nGROUP BY noun\nLIMIT 5;\n```\n\nThis query uses a subquery to select each noun and its synonyms, along with a row number (`rn`) that resets for each noun. The outer query then filters to include only the top three synonyms for each noun using `WHERE rn <= 3`. Finally, it groups the results by noun and concatenates the synonyms."
