        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering, `AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'AF_INET'`, suggests that there is a conflict with the module names in your code. This typically happens when a script or a module is named `socket.py`, which is the same name as Python's standard library module for networking. As a result, the code is importing your local `socket.py` instead of the standard library's `socket` module.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Rename Your Script File:**\n   Ensure that your script file is not named `socket.py`. Rename it to something else, for example, `websocket_server.py`.\n\n2. **Check for Socket Module Files:**\n   Ensure that there isn't another file named `socket.py` in the same directory or in your Python path that might be shadowing the standard library's `socket` module.\n\n3. **Clear Cache:**\n   If you had a file named `socket.py` previously, remove any associated `.pyc` files. These are compiled Python files that might still be in use.\n\n4. **Check Imports:**\n   Ensure that your imports are correct and that you're actually importing the standard library's `socket` module. Typically, this would look like:\n   ```python\n   import socket\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify Python Version:**\n   Consider upgrading your Python version if possible. Python 2.4.3 is quite outdated and lacks many features and security updates present in later versions. This might not be directly related to the error, but it's a good practice to use a more recent version of Python, such as Python 3.x.\n\nAfter making the above changes, try running your script again. If the issue persists, review your directory structure and ensure that no other conflicting modules are present."
