If we assume `veggies` is `TRUE` when he eats vegetables for lunch, the opposite statement would mean he does not eat vegetables for lunch. Here's how you can express this in R code:\n\n```r\n# Initialize the binary variable\nveggies <- TRUE\n\n# Express the opposite statement\nnot_veggies <- !veggies\n\n# Print the result\nprint(not_veggies)\n```\n\nIn this code, `veggies` is set to `TRUE` to indicate that he eats vegetables for lunch. The opposite, `not_veggies`, is obtained using the NOT operator (`!`), which negates the value of `veggies`. Therefore, `not_veggies` will be `FALSE`, indicating that the opposite statement is considered."
