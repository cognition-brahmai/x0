        "content": "In Python 2.7, I am puzzled by the behaviour of the `id` of objects of type `str`. The `str` type is immutable, so I would expect that once it is created, it will always have the same `id`. However, the sequence of my input and output isn't behaving as expected. When I input the `id` of 'so' multiple times, the output changes each time. However, once I assign the string to a variable, the `id` seems to freeze and remain the same, until the variable is deleted. This behavior contrasts with that of small integers. Furthermore, when I tried the same with a different string 'hello', the `id` remained the same each time, without assigning it to a variable. Could someone familiar with Python's internals explain the source of this behaviour?"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is related to the way Python handles string interning and memory management. Here's a breakdown of the behavior you're seeing:\n\n1. **String Interning**: Python optimizes memory usage and performance by reusing immutable objects like strings and integers in certain circumstances. This is known as \"interning.\" For strings, Python automatically interns some strings, such as those that look like identifiers (e.g., variable names) or are part of source code constants. Interned strings have the same `id` whenever they are referenced.\n\n2. **Small Integers**: Python pre-allocates small integers (usually in the range of -5 to 256) and keeps them in memory for reuse. This is why small integers always have the same `id`, regardless of where you use them in your program.\n\n3. **Behavior With 'so' and 'hello'**:\n   - When you repeatedly check the `id` of the string 'so' without assigning it to a variable, Python may create a new string object each time, particularly in interactive environments where optimizations might be different than in a script. This is why the `id` changes.\n   - Once you assign 'so' to a variable, Python maintains a reference to the object, preventing it from being garbage collected and reused, so the `id` remains stable.\n   - For 'hello', Python might be interning it due to its commonality or its use in the Python environment you are working in. Therefore, the `id` remains the same even without explicit assignment to a variable.\n\n4. **Garbage Collection and Caching**: Python uses reference counting and garbage collection to manage memory. When an object has no more references, it can be collected and its memory reused, which is why you might see different `id`s for short-lived strings unless they are interned or tied to a variable.\n\nThe specific behavior can vary based on the Python version and implementation you are using, as well as the context in which the code is executed (interactive shell vs. script)."
