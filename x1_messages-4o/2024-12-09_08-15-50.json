Currently, I am checking if the response status code is between 200 and 299 like this:\n\n```python\nr = requests.get(url)\nif 200 <= response.status_code <= 299:\n    # Do something here!\n```\nIs there a shorthand or a more elegant way to accomplish this?"

You can use the `response.ok` attribute, which returns `True` if the status code is less than 400, indicating a successful response. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\nr = requests.get(url)\nif r.ok:\n    # Do something here!\n```\n\nThis approach simplifies your code and makes it more readable by directly checking if the response was successful, without manually verifying the status code range."
