Is there a way for me to see the progress of this task in the form of a progress bar? Here is the code I am using: \n\n```python\nimport dask.dataframe as dd\n\ndf = dd.read_csv('data/train.csv')\ndf.id.count().compute()\n```"

Here's how you can modify your code to include a progress bar:\n\n```python\nimport dask.dataframe as dd\nfrom dask.diagnostics import ProgressBar\n\n# Enable the progress bar\nwith ProgressBar():\n    df = dd.read_csv('data/train.csv')\n    result = df.id.count().compute()\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThe `ProgressBar` context manager will display a progress bar in your Jupyter notebook while the computation is running. Once the computation is complete, the progress bar will disappear, and you'll be able to see the result of the computation."
