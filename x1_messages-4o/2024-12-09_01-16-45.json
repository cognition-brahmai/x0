For example, given the following code:\n\n```python\nprint('line 1')\nprint('line 2')\nprint('line 3')\n```\nThis entire cell will be executed and output:\n\n![cell and output](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ts8CC.png)\n\nHowever, I'm wondering how I could run only 'line 2' or even a selection of lines within this cell without executing the entire cell. I know I could insert a new cell with that single line or selection of lines, but I find that approach cumbersome and messy. Is there a better way to do this?"

        "content": "In JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook, executing only a part of a cell is not directly supported in the way you're describing, where you can execute a selection of lines without modifying the cell structure itself. However, there are some workarounds you can consider:\n\n1. **Temporary Commenting**: You can comment out the lines you don't want to execute temporarily. This can be done by selecting the lines you want to execute and using the `Ctrl + /` shortcut to toggle comments on the other lines. Then, run the cell with `Ctrl + Enter`.\n\n2. **Magic Commands**: Use IPython magic commands to run specific lines. For example, you can use the `%%capture` magic at the beginning of the cell to suppress the output of the unwanted lines if you're concerned about messy outputs.\n\n3. **Interactive Widgets**: If you often need to execute specific parts of your code, consider using interactive widgets from `ipywidgets` to create buttons or dropdowns that execute specific functions or lines of code when interacted with.\n\n4. **Cell Splitting**: Although you mentioned it might seem cumbersome, splitting cells can be useful. You can split a cell at the cursor's position using `Ctrl + Shift + -` to create a new cell with the specific lines you want to execute. This keeps your code modular and manageable.\n\n5. **Python Scripts**: For more complex tasks, consider writing your code in a Python script and using `%run script.py` in a Jupyter cell to execute specific sections of your code.\n\nWhile these methods can help, there is currently no built-in feature in Jupyter to execute only a highlighted portion of code directly within a single cell without some modification."
