I attempted to do this using a for loop and a while loop to check if the current character is equal to the next one and increment a counter. However, I run into an out of range issue when the loop reaches the last character. How can I solve this problem using built-in Python functions?\n\nHere is the code I have tried so far:\n```python\nword = '1000'\n\ncounter = 0\nprint range(len(word))\n\nfor i in range(len(word) - 1):\n    while word[i] == word[i + 1]:\n        counter += 1\n        print counter * \"0\"\n    else:\n        counter = 1\n        print counter * \"1\"\n```\nIn this example, I want Python to show that the digit 1 repeats once and the digit 0 repeats three times. The while loop in my code however fails."

        "content": "To count consecutive characters in a string and determine how many times each unique digit repeats before the next unique digit, you can use a more straightforward approach without running into index out of range issues. You can use a single loop to iterate through the string and keep track of the current character and its count. When you encounter a new character, you can print the count of the previous character and reset the counter for the new character. Here's a revised version of your code using a for loop:\n\n```python\nword = '1000'\ncounter = 1  # Start with 1 as the first character is counted\n\n# Iterate through the string starting from the second character\nfor i in range(1, len(word)):\n    if word[i] == word[i - 1]:\n        counter += 1  # Increment the counter if the current character is the same as the previous\n    else:\n        print(f\"{word[i - 1]} repeats {counter} time(s)\")\n        counter = 1  # Reset the counter for a new character\n\n# Print the count for the last group of characters\nprint(f\"{word[-1]} repeats {counter} time(s)\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- Start with `counter = 1` because the first character is counted once.\n- Loop through the string starting from the second character.\n- If the current character is the same as the previous one, increment the `counter`.\n- If a new character is encountered, print the previous character and its count, and reset the `counter` to 1.\n- After the loop, print the count for the last group of characters.\n\nThis approach avoids the out of range issue because it only accesses `word[i-1]`, which is always valid within the loop's range."
