        "content": "Certainly! The Euclidean algorithm is a classic method for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, and it can be extended to find the least common multiple (LCM). Let's go through the steps to find the LCM of 20 and 45 using the Euclidean algorithm and prime factorization.\n\n### Step 1: Finding the GCD using the Euclidean Algorithm\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm uses the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The formula used is:\n\n\\[ \\text{gcd}(a, b) = \\text{gcd}(b, a \\mod b) \\]\n\nWe'll apply this to find the GCD of 20 and 45.\n\n1. **First Iteration:**\n   - \\( a = 45, b = 20 \\)\n   - Calculate \\( 45 \\mod 20 = 5 \\)\n   - So, \\( \\text{gcd}(45, 20) = \\text{gcd}(20, 5) \\)\n\n2. **Second Iteration:**\n   - \\( a = 20, b = 5 \\)\n   - Calculate \\( 20 \\mod 5 = 0 \\)\n   - So, \\( \\text{gcd}(20, 5) = \\text{gcd}(5, 0) \\)\n\n3. **Final Step:**\n   - When \\( b = 0 \\), the GCD is \\( a \\).\n   - Therefore, \\( \\text{gcd}(5, 0) = 5 \\)\n\nThus, the GCD of 20 and 45 is 5.\n\n### Step 2: Finding the LCM using the GCD\n\nThe relationship between the GCD and LCM of two numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ \\text{lcm}(a, b) = \\frac{|a \\times b|}{\\text{gcd}(a, b)} \\]\n\nNow, substitute the known values:\n\n\\[ \\text{lcm}(20, 45) = \\frac{|20 \\times 45|}{5} = \\frac{900}{5} = 180 \\]\n\nTherefore, the LCM of 20 and 45 is 180.\n\n### Step 3: Prime Factorization Method for Verification\n\nAs an alternative method, let's use prime factorization to verify the LCM.\n\n1. **Prime Factorization of 20:**\n   - \\( 20 = 2^2 \\times 5^1 \\)\n\n2. **Prime Factorization of 45:**\n   - \\( 45 = 3^2 \\times 5^1 \\)\n\n3. **LCM Calculation Using Prime Factorization:**\n   - For the LCM, take the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations.\n   - \\( \\text{LCM} = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1 \\)\n   - Calculate: \\( 2^2 = 4, 3^2 = 9, 5^1 = 5 \\)\n   - Therefore, \\( \\text{LCM} = 4 \\times 9 \\times 5 = 180 \\)\n\nThe result matches the LCM we calculated using the Euclidean algorithm, confirming its accuracy.\n\nIn summary, you can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD and then compute the LCM using the relationship between GCD and LCM, or verify through prime factorization. Both methods provide the same result for the LCM of 20 and 45, which is 180."
