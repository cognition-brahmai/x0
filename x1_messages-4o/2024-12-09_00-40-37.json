I've got a simple table, not a grid table, where the rightmost column contains numbers. I'd like to right-align the numbers in this column, but I'm unsure how to do so. Here's the table for reference:\n\n```\n============  =====================\nEvent               Score variation\n============  =====================\nEvent 1                        +100\nEvent 2                         -25\nEvent 3                        -400\n============  =====================\n```\n\nI'm open to switching to a grid table if that will help me achieve right-alignment for the numbers in the column. Can anyone guide me on how to achieve this?"

        "content": "To achieve right-alignment in the rightmost column using reStructuredText with Sphinx, you'll need to switch to a grid table format. Grid tables allow more control over formatting, including alignment. Here's how you can right-align the numbers in the `Score variation` column:\n\n```rst\n+=========+=====================+\n| Event   | Score variation     |\n+=========+=====================+\n| Event 1 |                +100 |\n+---------+---------------------+\n| Event 2 |                 -25 |\n+---------+---------------------+\n| Event 3 |               -400  |\n+=========+=====================+\n```\n\nIn a grid table, you can manually adjust the spaces before the numbers in the `Score variation` column to achieve right alignment. Make sure to adjust the width of the column as needed to accommodate the longest number. This method requires manual formatting, but it gives you the desired alignment within the constraints of reStructuredText tables."
