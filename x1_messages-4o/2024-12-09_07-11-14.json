However, I am encountering an issue where the rowcount is always -1, which contradicts with what the Python3 documentation says (it should be None). This issue persists even after fetching all the rows. I have verified that there are rows in the table. Is this a bug in sqlite3? I understand that I can workaround this by checking if a fetchone() returns something different than None, but I would like to understand and discuss this issue."

        "content": "The behavior you're encountering with `sqlite3` in Python regarding the `rowcount` attribute is actually consistent with how the library is designed to work, and it is not a bug. The `rowcount` attribute in the `sqlite3` module has some nuances that are important to understand.\n\n1. **Rowcount Behavior**: \n   - For `SELECT` queries, `rowcount` typically returns `-1` because the number of rows affected is not known until the rows are fetched. This is consistent with the behavior of many database drivers, which do not provide the exact number of rows returned by a `SELECT` query until the rows are actually retrieved.\n   - For `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` queries, `rowcount` should reflect the number of rows affected by the operation.\n\n2. **Why -1 instead of None**: \n   - Historically, `sqlite3` in Python uses `-1` to indicate that for a `SELECT` query, the number of affected rows is not applicable or not yet determined. This is a design decision.\n\n3. **Fetching Rows**:\n   - To determine the number of rows in a result set, you must fetch the rows explicitly. You can use methods like `fetchall()` to get all rows and then check the length of the result to determine the row count.\n\n4. **Example Workaround**:\n   ```python\n   import sqlite3\n\n   conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')\n   cursor = conn.cursor()\n\n   cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM your_table\")\n   rows = cursor.fetchall()\n   num_rows = len(rows)\n\n   print(f\"Number of rows: {num_rows}\")\n   ```\n\nBy fetching all rows and calculating the length of the retrieved list, you get the precise number of rows returned by your query. This is a common approach when working with `sqlite3` in Python."
