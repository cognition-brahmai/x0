I want to delete any row that contains a zero, while keeping any row that contains non-zero values in all cells. I tried using a for-loop to iterate over the array and delete rows which have zero values but my code doesn't seem to do anything. How can I solve this?\n\nThe array and the code I tried is as follows:\n\n```python\nANOVAInputMatrixValuesArray = [[ 0.96488889, 0.73641667, 0.67521429, 0.592875, \n0.53172222], [ 0.78008333, 0.5938125, 0.481, 0.39883333, 0.]]\n\nNumNonzeroElementsInRows    = (ANOVAInputMatrixValuesArray != 0).sum(1)\n\nfor q in range(len(NumNonzeroElementsInRows)):\n    if NumNonzeroElementsInRows[q] < NumNonzeroElementsInRows.max():\n        p.delete(ANOVAInputMatrixValuesArray, q, axis=0)\n```"

        "content": "To remove rows containing zeros from a NumPy array, you can use boolean indexing instead of a for-loop for efficiency and simplicity. Your current code doesn't work because `numpy.delete` does not modify the array in place and you're not using the correct module reference (`p` is not defined). Here's how you can achieve your goal:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original array\nANOVAInputMatrixValuesArray = np.array([\n    [0.96488889, 0.73641667, 0.67521429, 0.592875, 0.53172222],\n    [0.78008333, 0.5938125, 0.481, 0.39883333, 0.]\n])\n\n# Create a boolean mask where rows with all non-zero elements are True\nnon_zero_rows_mask = ~np.any(ANOVAInputMatrixValuesArray == 0, axis=1)\n\n# Filter the array using the mask\nfiltered_array = ANOVAInputMatrixValuesArray[non_zero_rows_mask]\n\nprint(filtered_array)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of how this works:\n\n1. **`np.any(...) == 0, axis=1`:** This checks each row to see if any element is zero. This returns a boolean array where `True` indicates that at least one zero is present in the row.\n\n2. **`~`:** This negates the boolean array, so `True` becomes `False` and vice versa, effectively marking rows that do not contain zeros as `True`.\n\n3. **Boolean Indexing:** You use the boolean array to filter the original array, effectively selecting only the rows where all elements are non-zero.\n\nThis will give you a new array `filtered_array` with all the rows that do not contain any zeros."
