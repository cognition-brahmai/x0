I have written the following code:\n\n```python\nclass name(object, name):\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        print name\n```\n\nThen, I want to create two instances of that class:\n\n```python\nperson1 = name(\"jean\")\nperson2 = name(\"dean\")\n```\n\nBut I understand it's not possible to do it this way. How can I correctly pass an input argument into an instance of a class?"

        "content": "The issue with your current implementation is primarily with the class definition. Specifically, the class name and the argument name in the `__init__` method are conflicting. \n\nAdditionally, in Python, the `print` statement should be used with parentheses. Here is a corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nclass Person:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n        print(self.name)\n\n# Creating instances of the Person class\nperson1 = Person(\"jean\")\nperson2 = Person(\"dean\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Class Name:** I changed the class name to `Person` to avoid confusion with the `name` parameter. It's also good practice to use class names that start with a capital letter.\n\n2. **`__init__` Method:** This is the constructor method that is called when a new instance of the class is created. The `name` parameter is passed when creating an instance.\n\n3. **Attribute Initialization:** `self.name = name` assigns the passed name to an instance attribute `name`, which allows you to access it later.\n\n4. **Print Statement:** Python 3 requires the use of parentheses for the `print` function.\n\nNow, when you create instances `person1` and `person2`, their respective names will be printed to the console."
