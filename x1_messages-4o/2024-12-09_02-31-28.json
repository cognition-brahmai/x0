I have seen the example given in the Boto3 documentation for updating an item but it only shows how to update a single value. I want to know how can I update several values of an item. I tried this way, can someone confirm if this is the correct way to do it?\n\n```python\ntable.update_item(\n    Key={\n        'id': item['id']\n    },\n    UpdateExpression='SET value1 = :val1, value2 = :val2',\n    ExpressionAttributeValues={\n        ':val1': someValue1,\n        ':val2': someValue2\n    }\n)\n```"

        "content": "Yes, your approach for updating multiple values in a DynamoDB item using Boto3 is correct. The `UpdateExpression` syntax allows you to set multiple attributes in a single update operation by separating them with commas. Here\u2019s a breakdown of your code:\n\n- **Key**: Specifies the primary key of the item you want to update. In this case, it looks like you\u2019re using `id` as the primary key.\n- **UpdateExpression**: Defines the attributes you want to update and sets the new values. You\u2019ve correctly used `SET` to specify the attributes and their new values.\n- **ExpressionAttributeValues**: Provides the actual values that will be substituted into the `UpdateExpression`.\n\nYour code will update `value1` to `someValue1` and `value2` to `someValue2` for the item with the specified `id`. This syntax is efficient and concise for updating multiple attributes at once.\n\nJust make sure that `someValue1` and `someValue2` are defined in your code with the appropriate data types expected by DynamoDB for those attributes. If you have any conditional checks, you might also want to include a `ConditionExpression` to ensure the update only occurs under certain conditions."
