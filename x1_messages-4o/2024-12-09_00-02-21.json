The sentences are written in different languages, including Spanish, French, and Mandarin Chinese. You must use natural language processing techniques to extract the relevant information and output the entity and type for each sentence, separated by a comma. Additionally, you must also provide a SQL query that can extract all the sentences that contain numerical values greater than 5GB of RAM."

        "content": "To tackle this task, we'll break it down into a few steps:\n\n1. **Entity Recognition**: We need to identify entities such as names of people, places, objects, dates, times, and numerical values from each sentence.\n\n2. **Language Handling**: Given that sentences are in different languages, we must employ multi-language NLP models or language detection followed by language-specific models.\n\n3. **SQL Query Construction**: We'll write a query to extract sentences containing numerical values greater than 5GB of RAM.\n\nLet's begin with an example of how this may look for a few sentences, and I'll provide a template for the SQL query.\n\n### Example Entity Extraction (in multiple languages):\n\n1. **Sentence**: \"La conferencia en Par\u00eds fue el 12 de octubre de 2023.\"\n   - Entities: \n     - \"Par\u00eds\" (Place)\n     - \"12 de octubre de 2023\" (Date)\n\n2. **Sentence**: \"Le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone co\u00fbte 1000 euros.\"\n   - Entities:\n     - \"1000 euros\" (Price)\n\n3. **Sentence**: \"\u6211\u7684\u7535\u8111\u670916GB\u7684RAM\u3002\"\n   - Entities:\n     - \"16GB\u7684RAM\" (Memory)\n\n4. **Sentence**: \"John visited the Great Wall of China last year.\"\n   - Entities:\n     - \"John\" (Person)\n     - \"Great Wall of China\" (Place)\n     - \"last year\" (Date)\n\n### SQL Query:\n\nAssuming we have a table named `sentences` with a column `sentence_text`, the SQL query to extract sentences with numerical values greater than 5GB of RAM might look like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT sentence_text\nFROM sentences\nWHERE REGEXP_LIKE(sentence_text, '[0-9]+GB') AND \n      CAST(REGEXP_SUBSTR(sentence_text, '[0-9]+') AS UNSIGNED) > 5;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **REGEXP_LIKE**: Used to find sentences that mention \"GB\".\n- **REGEXP_SUBSTR**: Extracts the numerical part before \"GB\".\n- **CAST**: Converts the extracted number to an integer for comparison.\n- **WHERE Clause**: Ensures we only retrieve sentences with more than 5GB.\n\nThis framework can be iteratively applied to all 1000 sentences by employing an appropriate NLP pipeline that can handle multi-lingual inputs. Tools such as spaCy, NLTK, or libraries like Google's BERT multilingual model can be utilized for this purpose."
