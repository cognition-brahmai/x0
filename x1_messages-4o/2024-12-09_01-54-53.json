After this, my CUDA codes stopped working and the 'nvidia-smi' command returned 'Failed to initialize NVML: Driver/library version mismatch'. The version of the 'libnvidia-compute-440' package is now 440.59, but my drivers version is 440.33.01. I tried to revert back to the previous version of the library using 'apt-get install libnvidia-compute-440=440.33.01', but it returned 'E: Version '440.33.01' for 'libnvidia-compute-440' was not found'. How can I solve this issue without uninstalling CUDA?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is due to a mismatch between the NVIDIA driver version and the installed CUDA toolkit version. This often happens when package updates inadvertently update one component but not the others, leading to incompatibility. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Purge Existing NVIDIA Packages:**\n   First, remove all existing NVIDIA packages to ensure a clean slate:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get purge 'nvidia-*'\n   sudo apt-get autoremove\n   ```\n\n2. **Reinstall the Correct NVIDIA Driver:**\n   Since your CUDA version is 10.2, you need to ensure that the driver version is compatible. Visit the [NVIDIA CUDA compatibility page](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html#abstract) to confirm the correct driver version. For CUDA 10.2, you can use driver version 440.33.01 or later.\n\n   You can reinstall the appropriate driver using the runfile you used initially or through the package manager if the version is available:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install nvidia-driver-440\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify Installation:**\n   After reinstalling, reboot your system:\n   ```bash\n   sudo reboot\n   ```\n\n   Once rebooted, check if the driver is correctly installed:\n   ```bash\n   nvidia-smi\n   ```\n\n   This should display the correct driver version without errors.\n\n4. **Reinstall CUDA:**\n   If necessary, you might need to reinstall the CUDA toolkit. Since you used a runfile, simply run the installer again:\n   ```bash\n   sudo sh cuda_10.2.89_440.33.01_linux.run\n   ```\n\n   Follow the prompts, and make sure not to install the driver again if it's already correctly installed.\n\n5. **Environment Variables:**\n   Ensure that your environment variables are correctly set in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` file:\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-10.2/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}\n   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-10.2/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}\n   ```\n\n   Apply the changes:\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bashrc\n   ```\n\n6. **Test with a Sample Code:**\n   Finally, compile and run a CUDA sample code to confirm everything is set up correctly:\n   ```bash\n   cd /usr/local/cuda-10.2/samples/1_Utilities/deviceQuery\n   sudo make\n   ./deviceQuery\n   ```\n\n   If the output shows your GPU details without errors, your setup is complete.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the driver/library mismatch issue without having to uninstall CUDA completely."
