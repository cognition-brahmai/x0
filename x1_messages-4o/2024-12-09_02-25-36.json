        "content": "To read bytes from a file and write them to another file in Python, you can use the built-in `open()` function with the `'rb'` (read binary) mode for reading and `'wb'` (write binary) mode for writing. Here's a step-by-step example:\n\n1. **Open the source file in binary read mode**.\n2. **Read the contents of the file**.\n3. **Open the destination file in binary write mode**.\n4. **Write the contents to the destination file**.\n5. **Close both files**.\n\nHere's a simple example that demonstrates this process:\n\n```python\n# Specify the file paths\nsource_file_path = 'source_file.bin'\ndestination_file_path = 'destination_file.bin'\n\n# Open the source file in binary read mode\nwith open(source_file_path, 'rb') as source_file:\n    # Read the entire content of the source file\n    file_data = source_file.read()\n\n# Open the destination file in binary write mode\nwith open(destination_file_path, 'wb') as destination_file:\n    # Write the bytes to the destination file\n    destination_file.write(file_data)\n\nprint(f\"Data from {source_file_path} has been copied to {destination_file_path}.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`open(source_file_path, 'rb')`**: Opens the source file in binary read mode, allowing you to read bytes directly from the file.\n- **`source_file.read()`**: Reads all bytes from the source file.\n- **`open(destination_file_path, 'wb')`**: Opens the destination file in binary write mode, enabling you to write bytes to it.\n- **`destination_file.write(file_data)`**: Writes the bytes that were read from the source file into the destination file.\n- **`with` statement**: This ensures that the files are properly closed after their block of code is executed, even if an error occurs.\n\nThis method is efficient and works well for copying binary data, such as images, videos, or any non-text file."
