Here's a simple loop in Python that prints the numbers from 1 to 5:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(1, 6):\n    print(i)\n```\n\nThis loop uses Python's `range()` function, which generates numbers starting from the first argument up to, but not including, the second argument. In this case, it generates numbers from 1 to 5. The `for` loop iterates over these numbers, printing each one."
