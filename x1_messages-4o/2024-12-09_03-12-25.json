I'm trying to implement a condition where the code continues only if a certain substring, \"blah\" for example, is not contained in the string."

        "content": "Yes, in Python, you can check if a string contains a specific substring using the `in` keyword. This is a straightforward and Pythonic way to perform such a check. Here's how you can implement the condition where the code continues only if a certain substring, like \"blah\", is not contained in the string:\n\n```python\n# Example string\nmy_string = \"This is a sample string.\"\n\n# Check if the substring \"blah\" is not in the string\nif \"blah\" not in my_string:\n    # Continue with the code\n    print(\"The substring 'blah' is not in the string.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The substring 'blah' is in the string.\")\n```\n\nThis code will print \"The substring 'blah' is not in the string.\" because \"blah\" is not part of `my_string`. If the substring were present, it would print the alternative message. The `in` keyword is efficient and works well for this kind of substring check."
