When I have a method name with double-underscore in class A and try to override it in class B, it doesn't seem to work as expected. For example, when I create an object of class B, it's calling A's method instead of B's. I tried to override the name mangled method and it seemed to work. Is there something special about method names with double-underscores? Why is A's method called instead of B's? Here is the code I'm working with:\n\nClass A with a standard method:\n\n```python\nclass A(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.a()\n    def a(self):\n        print \"A.a()\"\n```\n\nClass B which overrides class A:\n\n```python\nclass B(A):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(B, self).__init__()\n    def a(self):\n        print \"B.a()\"\n```\n\nCreating an object of class B:\n\n```python\nb = B()\n```\n\nThis results in \"B.a()\" as expected.\n\nClass A with a double-underscore method:\n\n```python\nclass A(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.__a()\n    def __a(self):\n        print \"A.__a()\"\n```\n\nClass B which attempts to override this:\n\n```python\nclass B(A):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(B, self).__init__()\n    def __a(self):\n        print \"B.__a()\"\n```\n\nCreating an object of class B:\n\n```python\nb = B()\n```\n\nThis results in \"A.__a()\", which is not what I expected."

        "content": "The behavior you're encountering is due to Python's name mangling, which is applied to method names with double underscores (but not ending with double underscores). Name mangling is designed to prevent accidental access to class-private variables and methods in subclasses. This is why your method `__a` in class `A` is not being overridden by the method `__a` in class `B`, as they are treated as different names internally.\n\nHere's what's happening in your example:\n\n1. In class `A`, the method `__a` is name-mangled to `_A__a`.\n2. In class `B`, the method `__a` is name-mangled to `_B__a`.\n\nWhen you call `self.__a()` in `A`'s `__init__` method, it's actually calling `_A__a` because of the name mangling. As a result, the method in class `B` (`_B__a`) is not called because it's not the same name.\n\nTo override the method, you can either use a single underscore (e.g., `_a`) to avoid name mangling, or you can explicitly call the mangled method name in the subclass if you know it (which is not recommended for overriding):\n\nHere's how you can modify your classes to achieve the expected behavior:\n\n**Using a single underscore:**\n\n```python\nclass A(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._a()\n    def _a(self):\n        print(\"A._a()\")\n\nclass B(A):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(B, self).__init__()\n    def _a(self):\n        print(\"B._a()\")\n\nb = B()  # This will print \"B._a()\"\n```\n\n**Accessing the mangled method directly (not recommended for overriding):**\n\n```python\nclass A(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.__a()\n    def __a(self):\n        print(\"A.__a()\")\n\nclass B(A):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(B, self).__init__()\n    def _A__a(self):  # Explicitly overriding the mangled method\n        print(\"B.__a()\")\n\nb = B()  # This will print \"B.__a()\"\n```\n\nThe first approach, using a single underscore, is cleaner and more understandable, as it avoids the pitfalls of name mangling and is generally preferred for methods intended to be overridden in subclasses."
