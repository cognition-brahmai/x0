        "content": "Certainly! The `ImportError` you're encountering usually occurs if the Selenium package is not installed correctly, or if there's a problem with your Python environment setup. Here are the steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Selenium is Installed:**\n   First, make sure that Selenium is installed in your Python environment. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install selenium\n   ```\n\n   If you are using a virtual environment, ensure that it's activated before running this command.\n\n2. **Check for Typos:**\n   Double-check your import statements to ensure there are no typos, which it seems there aren't, based on the code you posted.\n\n3. **Python Environment:**\n   If you have multiple versions of Python installed, ensure that you are using the correct version where Selenium is installed. You can verify the Python version by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   ```\n\n   Or for Python 3 specifically:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 --version\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify Path and Environment Variables:**\n   Ensure that Python's site-packages directory (where the Selenium package is installed) is in your `PYTHONPATH` or that the Python environment is correctly set up.\n\n5. **Reinstall Selenium:**\n   If the above steps don't resolve the issue, try reinstalling Selenium:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall selenium\n   pip install selenium\n   ```\n\n6. **Check for Multiple Python Installations:**\n   If you have multiple Python installations, make sure you're using the pip that corresponds to the Python version you're executing. You can check this by:\n\n   ```bash\n   which pip\n   ```\n\n   Or on Windows:\n\n   ```bash\n   where pip\n   ```\n\n   Ensure it matches your Python executable path.\n\n7. **Verify WebDriver Installation:**\n   Ensure that you have the correct WebDriver installed for Firefox (geckodriver) and that it is in your system's PATH. You can download geckodriver from [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases).\n\n8. **Compatibility:**\n   Make sure that the versions of Python, Selenium, and geckodriver you are using are compatible with each other.\n\nIf you follow these steps and still encounter issues, please provide additional context or error messages, and I'll be glad to assist further!"
