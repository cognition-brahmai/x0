        "content": "Creating a regular expression (regex) pattern to detect URLs in Python can be a bit complex due to the variety of formats a URL can take. Here's a commonly used regex pattern for basic URL detection:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Regular expression pattern for URL detection\nurl_pattern = re.compile(\n    r'http[s]?://'  # http:// or https://\n    r'(?:[a-zA-Z]|[0-9]|[$-_@.&+]|[!*\\\\(\\\\),]|'  # Domain name characters\n    r'(?:%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]))+'  # Percent-encoded characters\n)\n\n# Sample text with URLs\ntext = \"Visit our site at https://example.com or our blog at http://blog.example.com.\"\n\n# Find all URLs in the text\nurls = url_pattern.findall(text)\n\n# Output the URLs\nprint(urls)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `http[s]?://`: Matches `http://` or `https://`.\n- `(?:...)`: Non-capturing group. It groups parts of the regex but does not capture them for back-references.\n- `[a-zA-Z0-9]`: Matches any uppercase or lowercase letter or digit.\n- `[$-_@.&+]`: Matches specific special characters that are valid in URLs.\n- `[!*\\\\(\\\\),]`: Matches additional special characters.\n- `(?:%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F])`: Matches percent-encoded characters, which are represented by a `%` followed by two hexadecimal digits.\n\nThis regex pattern should work for most simple use cases. However, if you're working with a wide variety of URLs, including those with query parameters, fragments, or internationalized domain names, you might need a more comprehensive solution or consider using a library like `validators` or `urllib.parse` for URL parsing and validation."
