Although my face detection code runs without any issues, I'm facing a problem with the face recognition part. The error that I'm getting is \"AttributeError: module 'cv2.cv2' has no attribute 'createLBPHFaceRecognizer'\". This error occurs when I'm trying to run the following code on a Windows platform with Python 3.6. \n\n```\nrecognizer = cv2.createLBPHFaceRecognizer()\n```\n\nThe complete error stack trace is:\n\n```\nC:\\Users\\MAN\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python36\\python.exe C:/Users/MAN/PycharmProjects/facerecognition/Recognise/recognize1.py\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"C:/Users/MAN/PycharmProjects/facerecognition/Recognise/recognize1.py\", line 4, in &lt;module&gt;\n    recognizer = cv2.createLBPHFaceRecognizer()\nAttributeError: module 'cv2.cv2' has no attribute 'createLBPHFaceRecognizer'\n\nProcess finished with exit code 1.\n```\n\nI've tried to troubleshoot the issue by consulting solutions online but to no avail. Could you please help me solve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is because the function `createLBPHFaceRecognizer()` is not available in the latest versions of OpenCV. In the newer versions of OpenCV (3.4 and above), the face recognizer classes have been moved to the `cv2.face` submodule. \n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use the correct function:\n\n1. First, ensure you have the `opencv-contrib-python` package installed. This package includes the `cv2.face` module, which is necessary for face recognition features.\n\n   You can install it using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install opencv-contrib-python\n   ```\n\n2. Modify your code to use the `cv2.face` submodule:\n\n   ```python\n   import cv2\n\n   # Use cv2.face.LBPHFaceRecognizer_create() instead\n   recognizer = cv2.face.LBPHFaceRecognizer_create()\n   ```\n\nThis change should resolve the `AttributeError` you are experiencing. The `LBPHFaceRecognizer_create()` function in the `cv2.face` module is the updated way to create an LBPH face recognizer in the latest OpenCV versions. Make sure that you have the `opencv-contrib-python` package installed, as the main `opencv-python` package does not include the `cv2.face` module."
