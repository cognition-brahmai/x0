        "content": "How can I get the column names or alias from a MySQL query in Python without using the SHOW COLUMNS command? I'm developing an application similar to heidisql where you input an SQL query and get a result set with rows and columns based on your query result. The column names in the result set should match the selected columns in your SQL query. However, when I run my query using the MySQLdb module in Python, I only get the row and column results but not the column names. For instance, in the example below, the column names would be ext, totalsize, and filecount. Is there a simple way to extract the column names from the given SQL query? Also, how can I determine the number of columns returned by the query?\n\n```python\nimport MySQLdb\n\n# connect to mysql\ntry:\n    db = MySQLdb.connect(host=\"myhost\", user=\"myuser\", passwd=\"mypass\",db=\"mydb\")\nexcept MySQLdb.Error, e:\n    print \"Error %d: %s\" % (e.args[0], e.args[1])\n    sys.exit (1)\n\n# query select from table\ncursor = db.cursor ()   \ncursor.execute (\"\"\"\\\n     select ext,\n        sum(size) as totalsize,\n        count(*) as filecount\n     from fileindex\n    group by ext\n    order by totalsize desc;\n\"\"\")\n\nwhile (1):\n    row = cursor.fetchone ()\n    if row == None:\n        break\n    print \"%s %s %s\\n\" % (row[0], row[1], row[2])\n\ncursor.close()\ndb.close() \n```"

        "content": "To get the column names from a MySQL query result in Python, you can use the `description` attribute of the cursor object. This attribute provides metadata about the columns in the result set, including their names. Here's how you can modify your code to extract and print the column names:\n\n```python\nimport MySQLdb\n\n# Connect to MySQL\ntry:\n    db = MySQLdb.connect(host=\"myhost\", user=\"myuser\", passwd=\"mypass\", db=\"mydb\")\nexcept MySQLdb.Error as e:\n    print(\"Error %d: %s\" % (e.args[0], e.args[1]))\n    sys.exit(1)\n\n# Query select from table\ncursor = db.cursor()\nquery = \"\"\"\n    SELECT ext,\n           SUM(size) AS totalsize,\n           COUNT(*) AS filecount\n    FROM fileindex\n    GROUP BY ext\n    ORDER BY totalsize DESC;\n\"\"\"\ncursor.execute(query)\n\n# Fetch column names\ncolumn_names = [desc[0] for desc in cursor.description]\n\n# Print column names\nprint(\"Column Names:\", column_names)\n\n# Fetch and print all rows\nrows = cursor.fetchall()\nfor row in rows:\n    print(row)\n\n# Close cursor and connection\ncursor.close()\ndb.close()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`cursor.description`**: This attribute provides a sequence of 7-item tuples where each tuple contains information about a column in the result set. The first item, `desc[0]`, is the name of the column.\n- **`fetchall()`**: Fetches all the rows in the result set after executing the query.\n- **Column Names and Count**: You can access the column names using the `description` attribute and determine the number of columns by checking the length of `column_names`.\n\nThis approach avoids using `SHOW COLUMNS` and directly retrieves the column names from the result set of your executed query."
