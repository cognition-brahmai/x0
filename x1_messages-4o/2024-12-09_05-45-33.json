The GPU array is populated with the number 7 and its data is then copied into the CPU array. In this code, I have come across the `cudaMalloc((void**)&device_array, num_bytes);` statement. Why does the `cudaMalloc()` function use a double pointer as its first argument instead of simply returning a pointer to the beginning of the allocated memory on the GPU, like the `malloc` function does on the CPU?\n\n```c\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n__global__ void kernel(int *array)\n{\n  int index = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;\n\n  array[index] = 7;\n}\n\nint main(void)\n{\n  int num_elements = 256;\n\n  int num_bytes = num_elements * sizeof(int);\n\n  // pointers to host & device arrays\n  int *device_array = 0;\n  int *host_array = 0;\n\n  // malloc a host array\n  host_array = (int*)malloc(num_bytes);\n\n  // cudaMalloc a device array\n  cudaMalloc((void**)&device_array, num_bytes);\n\n  int block_size = 128;\n  int grid_size = num_elements / block_size;\n\n  kernel<<<grid_size,block_size>>>(device_array);\n\n  // download and inspect the result on the host:\n  cudaMemcpy(host_array, device_array, num_bytes, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);\n\n  // print out the result element by element\n  for(int i=0; i < num_elements; ++i)\n  {\n    printf(\"%d \", host_array[i]);\n  }\n\n  // deallocate memory\n  free(host_array);\n  cudaFree(device_array);\n} \n```"

        "content": "In CUDA, the `cudaMalloc()` function is used to allocate memory on the GPU device. The reason it uses a double pointer as its first argument is because `cudaMalloc()` needs to modify the pointer that is passed to it so that it points to the newly allocated memory on the GPU.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how this works:\n\n1. **Pointer Modification**: In C/C++, when you want a function to modify a pointer (or any variable), you need to pass the address of that pointer to the function. This is because C/C++ functions pass arguments by value, meaning they receive copies of the arguments. If you pass the pointer directly, the function would only receive a copy of the pointer and wouldn't be able to modify the original pointer outside of its scope.\n\n2. **Double Pointer**: By passing a double pointer (e.g., `int **device_array`), you are effectively passing the address of the pointer. This allows `cudaMalloc()` to modify the original pointer to point to the allocated memory on the GPU.\n\n3. **Analogy to `malloc`**: In contrast, `malloc` returns a pointer to the allocated memory, which you can directly assign to your pointer variable. `cudaMalloc()` cannot return a pointer in the same way because it needs to return an error code to indicate success or failure of the memory allocation.\n\n4. **Usage**: In your code, you see `cudaMalloc((void**)&device_array, num_bytes);`. This casts the pointer to a `void**`, which is compatible with the `void**` type that `cudaMalloc()` expects, allowing it to update the pointer with the address of the allocated memory on the GPU.\n\nBy using this approach, `cudaMalloc()` can both allocate memory on the GPU and update the provided pointer to reference this new memory, all while still returning an error code (often checked for `cudaSuccess`) to indicate the success of the operation."
