I have tried using Python's standard `datetime.fromordinal()` and `datetime.fromtimestamp()` among others, but none of them seem to match. I have a hunch that this number corresponds to the current date (for example, 2012-3-16). How can I convert this number to a `datetime`?"

        "content": "The timestamp \"1331856000000\" appears to be in milliseconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970). In Python, the `datetime.fromtimestamp()` function expects a timestamp in seconds, not milliseconds. Therefore, you'll need to divide the timestamp by 1000 to convert it from milliseconds to seconds before using it with `fromtimestamp()`.\n\nHere's how you can convert the timestamp to a `datetime` object in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Given timestamp in milliseconds\ntimestamp_ms = 1331856000000\n\n# Convert milliseconds to seconds\ntimestamp_s = timestamp_ms / 1000\n\n# Convert to datetime\ndate_time = datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp_s)\n\nprint(date_time)\n```\n\nThis should output:\n\n```\n2012-03-16 00:00:00\n```\n\nSo, the timestamp \"1331856000000\" corresponds to the date 2012-03-16."
