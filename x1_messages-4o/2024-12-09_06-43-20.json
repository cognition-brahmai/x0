For instance, I have a class `Foo` which extends class `Bar`, and I want to override `Foo's` constructor slightly. However, I do not want to know the signature of `Bar's` constructors. How can I add an additional parameter to the constructor of class `Foo` without knowing anything about `Bar's` other parameters (`arg1`, `arg2`, ..., `argN`)? Is there any short and elegant way to replace the `???` in the following code?\n\n```python\nclass Bar:\n   def __init__(self, arg1=None, arg2=None, ..., argN=None):\n      ....\n\nclass Foo(Bar):\n    def __init__(self, my_new_arg=None, ???)\n       self.new_arg = my_new_arg\n       Bar.__init__(self, ???)\n```"

        "content": "To achieve what you're trying to do, you can use `*args` and `**kwargs` in Python, which allow you to pass a variable number of arguments to a function. This way, you don't need to know the exact signature of `Bar's` constructor. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nclass Bar:\n    def __init__(self, arg1=None, arg2=None, argN=None):\n        # Initialization for Bar\n        ...\n\nclass Foo(Bar):\n    def __init__(self, my_new_arg=None, *args, **kwargs):\n        self.new_arg = my_new_arg\n        # Pass all other arguments to the Bar constructor\n        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n\n# Example usage\nfoo_instance = Foo(my_new_arg=42, arg1='value1', arg2='value2', argN='valueN')\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **`my_new_arg`**: This is your new parameter specific to `Foo`.\n- **`*args`**: This captures any extra positional arguments passed to `Foo`'s constructor. If `Bar` takes positional arguments, they will be passed through here.\n- **`**kwargs`**: This captures any extra keyword arguments. This is particularly useful if `Bar` uses keyword arguments.\n\nThis setup allows you to override `Foo`'s constructor while still passing all other arguments to `Bar` without needing to know its signature."
