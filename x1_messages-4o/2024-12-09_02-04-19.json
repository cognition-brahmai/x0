I'm aware that Python checks if the functions occupy the same location in memory, but not if they have the same operation. Alternatively, is there a method I can run on a function to see what it contains or how it works? For instance, something like `(lambda x: x).what()` that would return how the method works, possibly in a dictionary or other format?"

        "content": "In Python, checking if two functions are equal based on their operations rather than their memory locations is not directly supported. However, you can achieve this by comparing the bytecode of the functions, which represents the compiled version of the function's code. Here's how you can do this:\n\n1. **Using the `dis` module**: You can disassemble the functions to get a human-readable version of the bytecode and compare these.\n\n2. **Using function attributes**: You can also compare attributes like the `co_code` attribute of a function's code object.\n\nHere's an example of how you might do this:\n\n```python\nimport dis\n\ndef are_functions_equal(func1, func2):\n    # Compare bytecode of both functions\n    return dis.Bytecode(func1).dis() == dis.Bytecode(func2).dis()\n\n# Example functions\nf1 = lambda x: x\nf2 = lambda y: y\n\nprint(are_functions_equal(f1, f2))  # This should print True\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can directly compare the `co_code` attribute:\n\n```python\ndef are_functions_equal_via_code(func1, func2):\n    return func1.__code__.co_code == func2.__code__.co_code\n\n# Example functions\nf1 = lambda x: x\nf2 = lambda y: y\n\nprint(are_functions_equal_via_code(f1, f2))  # This should print True\n```\n\n### Considerations:\n- **Parameter Names**: The names of parameters do not affect the equality in these methods since bytecode does not store variable names.\n- **Functionality**: These methods only check if the logic of the functions is the same, i.e., they produce the same bytecode.\n- **Limitations**: This won't account for differences in closures or default parameter values. You may need to check additional attributes of the function objects if these are relevant to your use case.\n\nThis approach gives you a way to compare the operational equivalence of two functions, albeit with some limitations."
