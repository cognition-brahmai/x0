The code I ran is as follows:\n\n```python\nPython 2.7.2 (default, Jun 29 2011, 11:10:00) \n[GCC 4.6.1] on linux2\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> True\nTrue\n>>> 0 == True\nFalse\n>>> 1 == True\nTrue\n>>> 2 == True\nFalse\n```\n\nFor contrast, I also tried using the `is` operator, and the results made more sense to me as they are:\n\n```python\n>>> 0 is False\nFalse\n>>> 1 is True\nFalse\n>>> 0 is 0\nTrue\n>>> True is True\nTrue\n```\n\nAdditionally, I noticed that when I set True as a key to a dictionary, I was able to access it using 1 as the key. What is happening?\n\n```python\n>>> d = {}\n>>> d[True] = \"hello\"\n>>> d[1]\n\"hello\"\n```"

        "content": "In Python, the behavior you're observing is due to how Boolean values are represented and compared with integers. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Boolean Type Representation**: \n   - In Python, `True` and `False` are actually subclasses of integers. Specifically, `True` is represented as `1`, and `False` as `0`. This is why `1 == True` evaluates to `True` and `0 == False` evaluates to `True`. However, `2` is not equal to `True` because `2` is not equal to `1`.\n\n2. **Using the `==` Operator**:\n   - When you use the `==` operator, Python checks for value equality. Since `True` is essentially `1`, `1 == True` evaluates to `True`. Similarly, `2 == True` is `False` because `2` is not equal to `1`.\n\n3. **Using the `is` Operator**:\n   - The `is` operator checks for identity, i.e., whether two references point to the same object in memory. Thus, `1 is True` evaluates to `False` because they are not the same object, even though they have the same value.\n\n4. **Dictionary Key Behavior**:\n   - In Python, dictionary keys are hashed. Since `True` and `1` have the same hash value, they can be used interchangeably as keys in a dictionary. This is why you can access `d[True]` with `d[1]` and vice versa.\n\n5. **Other Considerations**:\n   - This behavior is consistent across all versions of Python, including Python 3, although the example you provided is from Python 2.7. Be aware that in Python 3, there are some changes and improvements in how types and certain operations are handled, but the fundamental behavior of `True` and `False` as integer values remains the same.\n\nUnderstanding these nuances can help explain why certain operations behave the way they do when involving Boolean values and integers.
