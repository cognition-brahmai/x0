        "content": "It sounds like there might be a mismatch between the environment where you're trying to run your Jupyter Notebook and where you've installed matplotlib. Here are a few steps that might help resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check the Environment**: Ensure that you are running Jupyter Notebook in the same environment where matplotlib is installed. You can check the active environment in Jupyter by running this command in a cell:\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   print(sys.executable)\n   ```\n   This will display the path to the Python interpreter being used by Jupyter. Compare this with the Python interpreter path in your terminal (where you've successfully installed matplotlib).\n\n2. **Install Matplotlib in the Correct Environment**:\n   - If you've identified that Jupyter is using a different environment, activate that environment in your terminal and install matplotlib there. For example, if you're using conda:\n     ```bash\n     conda activate <your_environment_name>\n     conda install matplotlib\n     ```\n   - If you're using pip, do:\n     ```bash\n     pip install matplotlib\n     ```\n\n3. **Restart Jupyter Notebook**: Sometimes, simply restarting the Jupyter Notebook server can resolve the issue after installing a package.\n\n4. **Use the Correct Kernel**: If you have multiple Python environments, make sure that your Jupyter Notebook is using the correct kernel. You can change the kernel in Jupyter Notebook by going to the menu: `Kernel` -> `Change kernel`.\n\n5. **Reinstall Jupyter and Matplotlib**: If the above steps don't work, try reinstalling both Jupyter and matplotlib in the same environment:\n   ```bash\n   conda install jupyter\n   conda install matplotlib\n   ```\n   Or with pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install jupyter\n   pip install matplotlib\n   ```\n\n6. **Check for Multiple Python Installations**: Ensure that you don't have multiple installations of Python that might be conflicting. It's possible that your PATH is pointing to a different Python installation.\n\n7. **Use `%pip install` within the Notebook**: As a last resort, you can also try installing matplotlib directly from within a Jupyter Notebook cell using:\n   ```python\n   %pip install matplotlib\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with matplotlib not being found in your Jupyter environment."
