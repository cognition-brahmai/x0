However, I am having trouble compiling a simple code that has a global kernel calling another global kernel. I am using Visual Studio 2013 and in the property pages -> CUDA C/C++ -> device, I changed the code generation property to compute_35,sm_35. However, I am encountering an error that says \"kernel launch from __device__ or __global__ functions requires separate compilation mode\". I believe I need to set the option -rdc=true, but I am unsure of where to do this in VS2013. Additionally, when I set the code generation property to compute_52,sm_52, I get the error \"Unsupported gpu architecture 'compute_52'\", despite my cc being 5.2. Can I only compile codes for a maximum of 3.5 cc?"

        "content": "When working with CUDA and Visual Studio, especially with features like dynamic parallelism, it\u2019s necessary to configure your project correctly for separate compilation and to target the right compute capability.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can resolve the issues you\u2019re encountering:\n\n1. **Enable Separate Compilation:**\n   - Open your project in Visual Studio 2013.\n   - Go to the project properties by right-clicking on your project in the Solution Explorer and selecting \"Properties\".\n   - Navigate to `Configuration Properties -> CUDA C/C++ -> Common`.\n   - Set the `Generate Relocatable Device Code` option to `Yes (-rdc=true)`. This enables separate compilation, which is required for dynamic parallelism.\n\n2. **Set Correct Compute Capability:**\n   - It seems there might be a mismatch because `compute_52,sm_52` should be supported by the GTX 980 (which has a compute capability of 5.2).\n   - Ensure you are using a compatible version of the CUDA Toolkit that supports compute capability 5.2. CUDA 6.5 and later versions support compute capability 5.2.\n   - Check your CUDA installation and ensure it is correctly configured with Visual Studio.\n\n3. **Verify CUDA Toolkit Version:**\n   - Make sure you have installed an appropriate version of the CUDA Toolkit that supports the compute capability of your GPU.\n   - You can verify this by checking the `CUDA_VERSION` environment variable or by looking at the installed version in the NVIDIA folder.\n\n4. **Update Project Settings:**\n   - Navigate to `Configuration Properties -> CUDA C/C++ -> Device`.\n   - Set the `Code Generation` to `compute_52,sm_52`. This should match your GPU\u2019s compute capability.\n\n5. **Check for Updates:**\n   - Ensure Visual Studio 2013 is fully updated.\n   - Consider upgrading to a newer version of Visual Studio if possible, as newer versions have better support for CUDA development.\n\n6. **Reinstall CUDA Toolkit:**\n   - If none of the above works, try reinstalling the CUDA Toolkit to ensure that all components are correctly set up.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to compile your CUDA code with dynamic parallelism enabled and target the correct compute capability for your GTX 980 GPU."
