        "content": "Yes, it is possible to define a method outside of a class definition and even in a different module. In Python, functions are first-class objects, so you can assign them to class attributes from outside the class definition.\n\nHere's how you can define a method `myFunc` outside of a class definition and in a different module:\n\n### Step-by-step Guide\n\n1. **Define the Method in a Separate Module:**\n\n   Create a separate Python file (module) named `external_methods.py`:\n\n   ```python\n   # external_methods.py\n\n   def myFunc(self):\n       print(\"This is a method defined outside the class.\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Import and Assign the Method to the Class:**\n\n   Now, in your main module where your class `MyClass` is defined, you can import the method from `external_methods.py` and assign it to the class.\n\n   ```python\n   # main.py\n\n   from external_methods import myFunc\n\n   class MyClass:\n       pass\n\n   # Assign the external method to the class\n   MyClass.myFunc = myFunc\n\n   # Testing the method\n   obj = MyClass()\n   obj.myFunc()  # Output: This is a method defined outside the class.\n   ```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Method Definition**: The `myFunc` method is defined in a separate file `external_methods.py`. It takes `self` as its first argument to behave as an instance method of the class.\n\n- **Importing and Assigning**: In your main module, you import `myFunc` and then assign it to `MyClass.myFunc`. This effectively adds `myFunc` as a method of `MyClass`.\n\n- **Usage**: Once assigned, you can use `myFunc` as if it were defined inside the class. When you instantiate `MyClass` and call `obj.myFunc()`, it works as expected.\n\nThis approach allows you to modularize your code by keeping method definitions separate from class definitions, which can be useful for maintaining large codebases."
