Currently, when I run the following code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nX = np.zeros((100,10))\nX.shape        # >> (100, 10)\nxslice = X[10,:]\nxslice.shape   # >> (10,)  \n```\n\nI find that `xslice` becomes a 1 dimension array, but I want it to be a 2 dimensional array of shape (1,10). In R, I would use `X[10,:,drop=F]`. Is there a similar functionality in Numpy? I couldn't find this in the Numpy documentation."

        "content": "In NumPy, you can achieve this by using `np.newaxis` or `None` to add a new axis, which effectively keeps the dimension information intact when indexing. Here's how you can modify your code to maintain the 2-dimensional shape:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nX = np.zeros((100, 10))\nxslice = X[10, np.newaxis, :]\n# or equivalently\n# xslice = X[10, None, :]\nprint(xslice.shape)  # Output will be (1, 10)\n```\n\nBy using `np.newaxis` (or `None`), you are explicitly adding a new axis, thus maintaining the row as a 2D array with the shape (1, 10). This is similar to how you would use `drop=F` in R to retain the dimensions."
