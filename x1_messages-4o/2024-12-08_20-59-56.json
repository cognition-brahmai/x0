        "content": "Let's analyze the given sequence: 4, 9, 25, 64, 169, 441.\n\n1. **Perfect Squares:** According to the first hint, all numbers are perfect squares. Let's identify the square roots:  \n   - \\(4 = 2^2\\)  \n   - \\(9 = 3^2\\)  \n   - \\(25 = 5^2\\)  \n   - \\(64 = 8^2\\)  \n   - \\(169 = 13^2\\)  \n   - \\(441 = 21^2\\)  \n\n2. **Odd Numbers:** The sequence numbers themselves are not all odd, but their square roots are all odd numbers: 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21.\n\n3. **Difference Increasing by 5:** Let's calculate the differences between consecutive numbers in the sequence:  \n   - \\(9 - 4 = 5\\)  \n   - \\(25 - 9 = 16\\)  \n   - \\(64 - 25 = 39\\)  \n   - \\(169 - 64 = 105\\)  \n   - \\(441 - 169 = 272\\)  \n\n   The differences are: 5, 16, 39, 105, 272. If we observe these differences, the differences between the differences are increasing by adding successively larger odd numbers, which is not straightforward.\n\nHowever, if we look at the square roots (2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21), it appears to be following a sequence where the differences are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, which are Fibonacci numbers.\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next Fibonacci number after 8 is 13.\n\nSo, the next number in the sequence should be the square of the next odd number obtained by adding 13 to 21:\n\n\\[21 + 13 = 34\\]\n\nBut since the sequence consists of perfect squares of odd numbers, correct the sequence:\n\n\\[Next\\ odd\\ number\\ = 21 + 13 = 34\\ (But\\ 34\\ is\\ not\\ odd,\\ thus\\ incorrect\\ hint)\\]\n\nIt seems there was a mistake in the hint or the process of finding the next odd square. The correct sequence of differences added to the roots should be reviewed. Hence, let's correct it:\n\n\\[Next\\ odd\\ number\\ = 21 + 8 = 29\\]\n\nThus, the next number in the sequence, being the square of 29: \n\n\\[29^2 = 841\\]\n\nSo, the next number in the sequence is 841."
