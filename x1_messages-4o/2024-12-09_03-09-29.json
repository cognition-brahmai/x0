The first issue is that each buffer visiting a python file gets its own inferior interactive python shell, which is a problem for me as I am used to doing development in one interactive shell and sharing data between python files. The second issue is related to the skeleton-mode support in `python.el`. It seems unnecessary due to Python's syntax and it's poorly designed as it has no knowledge of \"for\" loop generator expressions or \"<expr 1> if <cond> else <expr 2>\" expressions, so I have to go back and remove the colons it inserts after insisting that I enter the expression clauses in the minibuffer. There is a `python.el` variable which is supposed to control this, but it doesn't seem to work. I am also looking for an updated version of `python.el` as the one I am using might be broken. Can anyone provide solutions for these issues and share their experience of using `python.el`?"

        "content": "Switching from `python-mode.el` to `python.el` can indeed present some challenges, especially if you're accustomed to certain workflows. Let's tackle the issues one by one:\n\n1. **Sharing a single interactive Python shell across buffers:**\n\n   By default, `python.el` might create a new Python process for each buffer. To maintain a single Python interactive session across multiple files, you can make use of the `python-shell-switch-to-buffer` function. Here\u2019s a basic approach:\n\n   - You can manually switch to an existing Python shell buffer using `M-x python-shell-switch-to-buffer`.\n   - Alternatively, you can customize your workflow using hooks to ensure that all Python files use the same shell. You can add something like this to your Emacs configuration:\n\n     ```emacs-lisp\n     (defun my-python-shell-setup ()\n       \"Ensure a single Python shell for all buffers.\"\n       (unless (get-buffer \"*Python*\")\n         (run-python (python-shell-calculate-command) nil nil))\n       (python-shell-switch-to-buffer))\n\n     (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'my-python-shell-setup)\n     ```\n\n   This approach will check if a Python shell is already running and will switch to it rather than creating a new one.\n\n2. **Skeleton-mode support and disabling it:**\n\n   The skeleton-mode behavior in `python.el` can indeed be intrusive if you prefer handling Python's syntax manually. You can disable this auto-insertion of colons and other skeleton behaviors by setting the relevant variable:\n\n   ```emacs-lisp\n   (setq python-skeleton-autoinsert nil)\n   ```\n\n   If this variable doesn't seem to work, it might be worth checking if there's a bug or conflict with other configurations or packages. Ensure that your configuration is loading correctly by evaluating the variable's value after startup.\n\n3. **Updated version of `python.el`:**\n\n   If the version of `python.el` you are using is outdated or seems broken, you have a few options:\n\n   - **Update Emacs**: Ensure that you are running a recent version of Emacs, as `python.el` is part of the Emacs distribution and receives updates with new Emacs releases.\n   - **Package Manager**: Use Emacs' package manager to check for any updated packages. Sometimes `python.el` improvements might be available via ELPA or MELPA.\n   - **Manual Update**: If necessary, you can download the latest `python.el` from the Emacs Git repository and replace the one in your Emacs installation, but this is more advanced and should be done carefully.\n\n4. **Community and Documentation:**\n\n   It can also be helpful to reach out to the Emacs community for specific advice, as they may have encountered and solved similar issues. The Emacs Stack Exchange, mailing lists, or forums can be valuable resources.\n\nBy addressing these issues, you should be able to create a smoother transition from `python-mode.el` to `python.el` while maintaining your preferred development workflow."
