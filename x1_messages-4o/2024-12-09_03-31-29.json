The code is intended to build an array of functions that take a single input and return that input added by a number:\n```python\nadders=[None, None, None, None]\nfor i in [0,1,2,3]:\n   adders[i]=lambda a: i+a\nprint adders[1](3)\n```\nI expected the result to be `4`, but it is `6`. It seems that all the lambda functions refer to the last value of `i`, `3`. Could you explain what the closures capture exactly and how can I modify the lambda functions to capture the current value of `i` in a way that will not be affected when `i` changes its value?"

        "content": "In Python, lambda functions (and other functions) have closures that capture variables, not their values. This means that if your lambda uses a variable from the enclosing scope, it doesn't capture the value of that variable at the time the lambda is defined; instead, it captures the variable itself. In your example, all the lambda functions capture the same `i` variable, which ends up being `3` after the loop finishes.\n\nTo fix this, you need to ensure that the current value of `i` at each iteration is captured by creating a new scope. One common way to achieve this is by using a default argument in the lambda function, which captures the value at the time the lambda is created. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nadders = [None, None, None, None]\nfor i in [0, 1, 2, 3]:\n    adders[i] = lambda a, i=i: i + a\n\nprint(adders[1](3))\n```\n\nIn this modified version, `i=i` in the lambda function's parameter list creates a default argument that captures the current value of `i` at each iteration. Thus, each lambda function has its own `i` value, and when you call `adders[1](3)`, it correctly returns `4` because `i` was `1` at the time that particular lambda was created."
