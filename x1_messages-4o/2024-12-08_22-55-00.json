Can you solve this puzzle and come up with a solution that offers a more comprehensive understanding of the sentiment conveyed in the text?"

        "content": "Creating a sentiment analysis system that not only identifies the emotional polarity but also determines the intensity level involves a multi-step approach. Here's a conceptual framework for building such a system:\n\n### Step 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing\n- **Data Collection**: Gather a large and diverse dataset of text samples with labeled sentiments and intensity levels. This can include reviews, social media posts, etc.\n- **Preprocessing**: Clean the text data by removing noise such as punctuation, stopwords, and special characters. Tokenize the text into words or phrases.\n\n### Step 2: Sentiment Polarity Detection\n- **Model Selection**: Use a pre-trained transformer-based model like BERT or RoBERTa fine-tuned for sentiment analysis. These models capture contextual information effectively.\n- **Polarity Classification**: Train the model to classify text into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral.\n\n### Step 3: Intensity Level Determination\n- **Intensity Lexicon**: Develop or use an existing lexicon that includes words and phrases associated with different intensity levels (e.g., \"happy\" vs. \"ecstatic\").\n- **Feature Extraction**: Extract features related to intensity, such as the presence of intensifiers (e.g., \"very,\" \"absolutely\") and exclamation marks.\n\n### Step 4: Intensity Scoring System\n- **Scale Definition**: Define a scale for intensity levels, such as low, medium, or high.\n- **Model Training**: Train a regression model or a multi-class classifier to predict the intensity level based on the extracted features and the embeddings from the sentiment model.\n\n### Step 5: Integration and Output\n- **Integration**: Combine the outputs of sentiment polarity detection and intensity scoring.\n- **Output**: Provide a comprehensive sentiment analysis that includes both the polarity and the intensity level. For example, \"Positive with high intensity.\"\n\n### Step 6: Evaluation and Iteration\n- **Evaluation**: Use metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and mean squared error to evaluate the system's performance.\n- **Iteration**: Continuously improve the system by adding more data, refining the lexicon, and enhancing feature extraction methods.\n\n### Example:\nFor the input \"I'm absolutely over the moon with this product!\", the system would output:\n- **Polarity**: Positive\n- **Intensity**: High\n\nThis approach provides a nuanced sentiment analysis that captures both the direction and strength of emotions expressed in the text."
