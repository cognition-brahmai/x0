Here's a concept for a minimalist, energy-saving poster:\n\n---\n\n**[Visual: A simple, small LED light bulb icon, half-lit]**\n\n**Text:**\n\n\"Illuminate Wisely\"\n\n\"Switch to LED - Save Energy, Save the Planet\"\n\n---\n\n**Design Notes:**\n\n- **Color Scheme:** Use a soft, calming palette with greens and blues to symbolize sustainability and tranquility.\n  \n- **Font:** Choose a clean, sans-serif font for modernity and readability.\n\n- **Layout:** Keep ample white space to convey simplicity and efficiency.\n\nThis design uses minimal imagery and text to convey a powerful message about energy conservation through a simple action: switching to LED lights. The half-lit bulb symbolizes the concept of using only as much energy as necessary."
