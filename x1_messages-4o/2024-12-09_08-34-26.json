I'm working on the basic Django tutorial and after creating the \"polls\" application and \"Poll\" class, I start up the interpreter and import the \"polls\" app. After making changes to the \"Poll\" class by adding a method, I try to reload the module and use the new method, but I get an error message saying \"'Poll' object has no attribute 'x'\". I've tried various methods to resolve the issue, but nothing seems to work. How can I solve this?"

        "content": "When working with Django's `manage.py shell`, you may encounter issues where changes to a model or module do not immediately reflect in the interactive shell session. This is because Python modules are only loaded once per session, and subsequent imports use the cached version unless explicitly reloaded.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can reload a Django model module in an interactive interpreter session:\n\n1. **Start the Django Shell**:\n   First, ensure you are in the root directory of your Django project, and then start the Django shell with:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py shell\n   ```\n\n2. **Import the Module**:\n   Import the model or module you are working with. For example:\n   ```python\n   from polls.models import Poll\n   ```\n\n3. **Make Changes**:\n   After making changes to your `Poll` model, you need to reload the module to reflect those changes in the shell.\n\n4. **Reload the Module**:\n   Use Python's built-in `importlib` library to reload the module. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n   ```python\n   import importlib\n   from polls import models\n\n   importlib.reload(models)\n   ```\n\n   After reloading the module, you should import the model again:\n   ```python\n   from polls.models import Poll\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify the Changes**:\n   Now, you should be able to use the newly added method or any other changes you've made to the `Poll` class.\n\n6. **Alternative Approach**:\n   If you frequently make changes and want them to reflect immediately, consider using `ipython` with Django extensions, which might handle reloading more gracefully. You can install it using:\n   ```bash\n   pip install ipython django-extensions\n   ```\n\n   Then, use the shell with:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py shell_plus --ipython\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to reload your Django model module and utilize the recent changes in your interactive shell session."
