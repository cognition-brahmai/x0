        "content": "I am facing a problem with generator exceptions in Python. I have a function that reads data in different formats. For each format, there's a dedicated parsing function, implemented as a generator. The main reading function gets an input and a generator, which reads its respective format from the input and delivers records back to the main function. The problem is that while the parsing function can throw an exception when reading from a stream, it does not know how to handle it. The function responsible for handling exceptions is the main reading function. I tried to put `next(parsefunc)` in a `try` block but it didn't work. I am hesitant to add a `try-except` block to the parsing function itself because it would clutter the code and it's unclear how to pass exceptions to the consuming function. Could you suggest a better architecture for this problem?"

        "content": "Certainly! Handling exceptions in generator functions can be a bit tricky, but you can design a clean and efficient architecture by following a structured approach. Here's a possible solution:\n\n### Approach:\n\n1. **Use a Wrapper Generator**: Instead of directly iterating over the parsing generator, wrap it in another generator function that handles exceptions and communicates them back to the main reading function.\n\n2. **Communicate Exceptions**: Use a custom exception or a sentinel value to communicate errors from the parsing generator to the main function.\n\n3. **Centralize Exception Handling**: Keep the exception handling logic in the main reading function, where it's easier to manage.\n\n### Implementation:\n\nHere's an example of how you might implement this architecture:\n\n#### Step 1: Define a Custom Exception\n\nFirst, define a custom exception that will be used to signal errors in the parsing function:\n\n```python\nclass ParsingError(Exception):\n    def __init__(self, message, record=None):\n        super().__init__(message)\n        self.record = record\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Create a Wrapper Generator\n\nCreate a wrapper generator that will yield from the parsing generator and handle any exceptions:\n\n```python\ndef parsing_wrapper(parse_func, data):\n    try:\n        yield from parse_func(data)\n    except Exception as e:\n        # Wrap the exception in a custom exception to communicate back to the main function\n        raise ParsingError(\"Error during parsing\", record=data) from e\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Main Reading Function\n\nIn the main reading function, handle the exceptions raised by the wrapper:\n\n```python\ndef main_reading_function(data, parse_func):\n    parser = parsing_wrapper(parse_func, data)\n    while True:\n        try:\n            record = next(parser)\n            # Process record\n            print(\"Record processed:\", record)\n        except ParsingError as e:\n            print(f\"Handling ParsingError: {e}, Record: {e.record}\")\n            # Handle the error (e.g., log it, skip the record, etc.)\n            continue\n        except StopIteration:\n            break\n```\n\n#### Step 4: Parsing Function\n\nImplement the parsing function as a generator. It can raise exceptions naturally:\n\n```python\ndef parse_format(data):\n    for record in data:\n        if some_condition_causing_error(record):\n            raise ValueError(\"Invalid record format\")\n        yield process_record(record)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Wrapper Generator**: `parsing_wrapper` acts as an intermediary between the parsing function and the main function. It catches exceptions from the parsing generator and re-raises them as `ParsingError`.\n\n- **Main Function**: `main_reading_function` takes care of consuming the records and handling any potential `ParsingError` exceptions. It can decide what to do with errors\u2014log them, skip the record, stop processing, etc.\n\n- **Separation of Concerns**: This architecture separates the parsing logic from error handling, making your code cleaner and easier to maintain.\n\nBy following this approach, you can keep your parsing functions focused on their core task and manage exceptions in a centralized manner."
