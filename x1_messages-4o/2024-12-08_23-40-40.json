        "content": "The Go code you provided is already quite efficient in removing redundant words from a sentence and arranging it into a grammatically correct form. However, I noticed that your example output does not match the expected result given the input sentence. Here's a corrected version of your Go code to ensure it performs as intended:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"strings\"\n)\n\nfunc cleanSentence(sentence string) string {\n\twords := strings.Fields(sentence)\n\tuniqueWords := make(map[string]bool)\n\tcleanedWords := []string{}\n\n\tfor _, word := range words {\n\t\tif !uniqueWords[word] {\n\t\t\tuniqueWords[word] = true\n\t\t\tcleanedWords = append(cleanedWords, word)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\treturn strings.Join(cleanedWords, \" \")\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Example usage\n\toriginalSentence := \"We have done have had it done already\"\n\tcleanedSentence := cleanSentence(originalSentence)\n\tfmt.Println(cleanedSentence)\n\t// Output: \"We have done had it already\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Data Structure**: A `map[string]bool` is used to track words that have already been added to the result.\n2. **Use of Slice**: Instead of building the cleaned sentence as a string directly, we build a slice of words and then join them. This is generally more efficient and idiomatic in Go.\n3. **Output Consistency**: The example output now matches the logic applied in removing duplicates while maintaining the order of first occurrences.\n\nBy following this approach, you ensure that the sentence is cleaned of redundant words while maintaining its grammatical structure."
