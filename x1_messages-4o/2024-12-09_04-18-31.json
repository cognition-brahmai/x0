Is there an alternative way to do this without installing a third-party library like pycurl? I need my code to communicate with the remote server for a fixed amount of time."

        "content": "In Python versions prior to 2.6, the `urllib2` module does not support the `timeout` parameter directly. However, you can simulate a timeout by using the `socket` module to set a default timeout for all socket connections. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport socket\nimport urllib2\n\n# Set the default timeout for all socket connections\ntimeout_duration = 10  # Timeout duration in seconds\nsocket.setdefaulttimeout(timeout_duration)\n\n# Now perform your urllib2 request\ntry:\n    url = 'http://example.com'\n    response = urllib2.urlopen(url)\n    content = response.read()\n    print(content)\nexcept urllib2.URLError as e:\n    print(\"Error:\", e)\nexcept socket.timeout:\n    print(\"Request timed out\")\n```\n\nIn this example, `socket.setdefaulttimeout()` sets a global timeout for all socket operations, which will apply to all `urllib2` requests. If the request takes longer than the specified timeout duration, a `socket.timeout` exception will be raised.\n\nKeep in mind that setting a global timeout using `socket.setdefaulttimeout()` will affect all network operations in your script that use sockets, so use it with care if you have other network operations that might require different timeout settings."
