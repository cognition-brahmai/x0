Here's my code:\n\n```python\nclass Example():\n\n    if __name__ == '__main__':\n        Example().main()        # What goes here?\n\n    def main(self):     \n        print \"Hello World!\n```\n\nI'm unclear on what should go in the place of `Example().main()`. I've tried `self.main()`, `main()`, and `main(self)`, but none of these seem to work. What am I doing wrong?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is due to a couple of common mistakes when transitioning from languages like C/Java to Python, especially in terms of understanding how classes and methods work in Python.\n\n1. **Indentation**: Python uses indentation to define the structure of the code. The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block should be outside of the class definition.\n\n2. **Method call**: When calling an instance method from outside the class, you need to create an instance of the class first and then call the method on that instance.\n\nHere's how you can structure your code correctly:\n\n```python\nclass Example:\n    def main(self):\n        print(\"Hello World!\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    example_instance = Example()  # Create an instance of the Example class\n    example_instance.main()       # Call the main method on the instance\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Class Definition**: The class `Example` is defined with a method `main` that prints \"Hello World!\".\n  \n- **Instance Creation**: `example_instance = Example()` creates an instance of the class `Example`.\n\n- **Method Call**: `example_instance.main()` calls the `main` method on the instance.\n\n- **Printing**: Ensure that you use parentheses with `print` as it is a function in Python 3. If you're using Python 2, your syntax is correct; however, it's generally recommended to adopt Python 3 conventions unless you have a specific need for Python 2.\n\nThis structure should work seamlessly in your Python environment, and you'll see \"Hello World!\" printed when you run your script."
