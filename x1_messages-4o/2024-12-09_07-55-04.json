However, since tqdm can't get the total number of examples from the generator I'm using, the only thing it shows is the estimated iterations/second. Is there a way to tell tqdm the total number of elements it will be looping over so I can get some of the other statistics?"

        "content": "Yes, you can use `tqdm` to track the progress of processing a large file with a generator by explicitly providing the total number of elements. Since you know the total length of the file, you can pass this number to `tqdm` to get more detailed progress statistics. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Import the necessary modules.\n2. Use `tqdm` to wrap your generator and provide the `total` parameter with the known number of elements.\n3. Iterate over your generator with `tqdm` to track progress.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\n\ndef process_file_line_by_line(file_path):\n    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n        for line in file:\n            yield line\n\n# Assuming you know the total number of lines in the file\ntotal_lines = 1000000  # Replace this with the actual total number\n\nfile_path = 'your_large_file.txt'\n\n# Wrap the generator with tqdm, providing the total number of elements\nfor line in tqdm(process_file_line_by_line(file_path), total=total_lines):\n    # Process each line\n    process(line)\n```\n\nIn this example, replace `your_large_file.txt` with the path to your file and `process(line)` with your actual processing logic. The `tqdm` progress bar will now show additional statistics like percentage complete, time remaining, etc., based on the total number of lines you provided."
