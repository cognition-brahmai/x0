Here's a simple function to achieve this:\n\n```javascript\nfunction removeNonAlphabets(input) {\n    // Use a regular expression to match only alphabetic characters (both uppercase and lowercase)\n    return input.replace(/[^a-zA-Z]/g, '');\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst inputString = \"Hello, World! 123\";\nconst result = removeNonAlphabets(inputString);\nconsole.log(result); // Output: HelloWorld\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- The regular expression `/[^a-zA-Z]/g` is used to match any character that is not an uppercase (`A-Z`) or lowercase (`a-z`) letter.\n- The `replace` method is used to replace these non-alphabetic characters with an empty string, effectively removing them from the input.\n- The `g` flag in the regular expression ensures that all occurrences of non-alphabetic characters are replaced, not just the first one."
