Here is a Python version of the code you provided:\n\n```python\nobjects = [/* your list of objects */]\nfoo = somevalue\nprevious = next_item = None\n\nfor i in range(1, len(objects) - 1):\n    if objects[i] == foo:\n        previous = objects[i - 1]\n        next_item = objects[i + 1]\n        # If you want to break after finding the first match\n        break\n\n# If you need to handle the case where foo is at the boundaries\n# (first or last position), you can adjust the indices accordingly:\nif objects[0] == foo:\n    previous = None\n    next_item = objects[1] if len(objects) > 1 else None\nelif objects[-1] == foo:\n    previous = objects[-2] if len(objects) > 1 else None\n    next_item = None\n\nprint(f\"Previous: {previous}, Current: {foo}, Next: {next_item}\")\n```\n\nThis code handles the case where `foo` might be at the first or last position in the list, and it assumes `foo` exists in the list. Adjust the handling as necessary based on your specific requirements."
