I'm using Python version 3.4.2, mongolab running mongod 2.6.9, uWSGI 2.0.10, CherryPy 3.7.0, and nginx 1.6.2. The error does not occur when I run the same code through a unit test or using the CherryPy built-in server. I suspect this may be related to the new thread model in PyMongo 3. \n\nHere is the code that I am using to connect to the MongoDB server and save a JSON dict:\n\n```python\nself.mongo_client = MongoClient('mongodb://user:pw@host.mongolab.com:port/mydb')\nself.db = self.mongo_client['mydb']\nresult = self.db.jobs.insert_one(job_dict)\n```\n\nThe error message I receive is as follows:\n\n```python\npymongo.errors.ServerSelectionTimeoutError: No servers found yet\n```\n\nUpon adding some debug in PyMongo, I found that `topology._update_servers()` recognizes the server_type = 2 for server 'myserver-a.mongolab.com', but `server_description.known_servers()` has the server_type = 0 for server 'myserver.mongolab.com'. The stack trace is as follows:\n\n```python\nresult = self.db.jobs.insert_one(job_dict)\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python3.4/site-packages/pymongo/collection.py\", line 466, in insert_one\nwith self._socket_for_writes() as sock_info:\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python3.4/contextlib.py\", line 59, in __enter__\nreturn next(self.gen)\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python3.4/site-packages/pymongo/mongo_client.py\", line 663, in _get_socket\nserver = self._get_topology().select_server(selector)\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python3.4/site-packages/pymongo/topology.py\", line 121, in select_server\naddress))\nFile \"/usr/local/lib/python3.4/site-packages/pymongo/topology.py\", line 97, in select_servers\nself._error_message(selector))\npymongo.errors.ServerSelectionTimeoutError: No servers found yet\n```"

        "content": "The `ServerSelectionTimeoutError` in PyMongo usually indicates that the client is unable to connect to any server within the specified timeout period. Since you are encountering this issue specifically when using uWSGI with CherryPy, there are a few potential causes and solutions to consider:\n\n1. **Threading Model**: PyMongo 3.0 introduced a new monitoring system that uses background threads to check the status of servers. uWSGI may be configured to use multiple processes or threads, which could conflict with PyMongo's threading model. Ensure that uWSGI is configured to handle threads appropriately, or consider using a single-threaded mode to test if this resolves the issue.\n\n2. **uWSGI Configuration**: Check your uWSGI configuration settings to make sure it allows for the necessary network connections. Specifically, check if the `threads` parameter is set, which allows threads to be used (e.g., `threads = 2`).\n\n3. **Network Access**: Ensure that your uWSGI process has the necessary network permissions to access MongoDB. Sometimes, firewall or network restrictions might prevent the connection. Also, verify that the MongoDB URI is correct and accessible from the server running uWSGI.\n\n4. **Timeout Settings**: Increase the `serverSelectionTimeoutMS` parameter in your MongoClient connection string to allow more time for the server selection process:\n   ```python\n   self.mongo_client = MongoClient('mongodb://user:pw@host.mongolab.com:port/mydb', serverSelectionTimeoutMS=5000)\n   ```\n\n5. **Resource Limits**: Ensure that there are no resource limits being imposed by the operating system or uWSGI itself that might restrict the number of open connections or threads.\n\n6. **Concurrency Model**: If you are using uWSGI with multiple processes, try reducing the number of processes or use a single process with multiple threads to see if the issue persists.\n\n7. **Logging and Debugging**: Enable detailed logging in uWSGI and PyMongo to gather more information about the connection attempts and failures. Look for any signs of network issues or configuration problems.\n\n8. **Library Compatibility**: Ensure that all your libraries, including PyMongo, CherryPy, and uWSGI, are compatible with each other and with your Python version. Consider upgrading to the latest versions if possible, as there may be bug fixes or improvements.\n\nBy systematically addressing these potential issues, you should be able to identify the root cause of the `ServerSelectionTimeoutError` and implement the appropriate solution. If the problem persists, consider testing the connection outside of the uWSGI environment to see if the issue is indeed related to the deployment setup."
