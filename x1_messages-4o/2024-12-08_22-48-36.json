This suggests that the park may have suitable conditions for bats, such as the presence of trees or insects for food.\n\nPotential ambiguities or exceptions to this conclusion include:\n\n1. **Type of Bat**: The word \"bat\" could refer to either the flying mammal or a baseball or cricket bat. Context is needed to clarify this ambiguity.\n\n2. **Time and Place**: The friend mentioned \"last night\" and \"the park,\" but without specific details, it's unclear which park or the exact time of the sighting.\n\n3. **Observation Conditions**: The message doesn't specify how the bat was observed (e.g., visually, audibly, or through another method), which could affect the accuracy of the identification.\n\n4. **Multiple Meanings**: In some contexts, \"bat\" could be part of a colloquial expression or slang, leading to different interpretations.\n\nWithout additional context, these ambiguities remain, but the straightforward interpretation is the observation of a flying mammal in a park during nighttime."
