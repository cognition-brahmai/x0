        "content": "In the latest release of PyCharm, and in general, the suggestion to convert methods that do not interact with the current object's state to static methods serves several practical purposes:\n\n1. **Clarity and Intent**: By making a method static, you clearly indicate that this method does not depend on any instance-specific data. This can make your code more readable and intentions clear to other developers who may work on the same codebase.\n\n2. **Avoid Unnecessary Object Creation**: Static methods can be called on the class itself rather than on instances of the class. This means you can avoid creating an unnecessary instance of the class just to use a method that doesn't interact with the instance's state, potentially reducing memory usage.\n\n3. **Performance Optimization**: While the performance gains might be minimal in many cases, static methods can be slightly faster than instance methods because the method does not need to take a reference to the instance as its first argument (`self` in Python). This can lead to minor performance improvements, especially if the method is called frequently.\n\n4. **Design and Structure**: Encouraging the use of static methods when appropriate can help promote better software design and structure. It aligns with principles like separation of concerns, where methods are only concerned with the data they need to operate on and not with the state of an object.\n\n5. **Reusability**: Static methods can be reused across different parts of a program without the need to instantiate the class. This enhances the reusability of utility functions that do not depend on any instance data.\n\nIn summary, converting methods to static when they do not use the object's state is more about code clarity, design principles, and potential minor optimizations rather than a significant performance or memory optimization."
