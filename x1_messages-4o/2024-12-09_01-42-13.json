However, I am facing an issue where the tokenizer removes any new word, not in its word index, from the sequence during predictions. Is there a way to use the tokenizer to transform sentences into an array while leveraging as much of the GloVe dictionary words as possible, instead of only the ones present in my training text? I'm contemplating adding a text or texts to the tokenizer fitting that includes a list of keys from the GloVe dictionary, but I'm concerned it might affect my statistics if I want to use tf-idf. Is there a preferable way to do this or a different better approach?\n\nHere is my current code:\n\n```python\n#fit the tokenizer\ntokenizer = Tokenizer()\ntokenizer.fit_on_texts(texts)\nword_index = tokenizer.word_index\n\n#load glove embedding into a dict\nembeddings_index = {}\ndims = 100\nglove_data = 'glove.6B.'+str(dims)+'d.txt'\nf = open(glove_data)\nfor line in f:\n    values = line.split()\n    word = values[0]\n    value = np.asarray(values[1:], dtype='float32')\n    embeddings_index[word] = value\nf.close()\n\n#create embedding matrix\nembedding_matrix = np.zeros((len(word_index) + 1, dims))\nfor word, i in word_index.items():\n    embedding_vector = embeddings_index.get(word)\n    if embedding_vector is not None:\n        # words not found in embedding index will be all-zeros.\n        embedding_matrix[i] = embedding_vector[:dims]\n\n#Embedding layer:\nembedding_layer = Embedding(embedding_matrix.shape[0],\n                        embedding_matrix.shape[1],\n                        weights=[embedding_matrix],\n                        input_length=12)\n\n#then to make a prediction\nsequence = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences([\"Test sentence\"])\nmodel.predict(sequence)\n```"

        "content": "To address the issue you're facing, you can take a couple of approaches to make better use of the GloVe dictionary while predicting sequences with new words that might not be present in your training text. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Pre-fit the Tokenizer on GloVe Vocabulary**: You can initialize your tokenizer with the GloVe vocabulary to ensure it recognizes as many words as possible, including those not present in your training set. This can be done by creating a dummy text containing all GloVe words:\n\n   ```python\n   # Create a list of all GloVe words\n   glove_words = list(embeddings_index.keys())\n\n   # Fit the tokenizer on GloVe words and your texts\n   tokenizer = Tokenizer()\n   tokenizer.fit_on_texts(glove_words + texts)\n   word_index = tokenizer.word_index\n   ```\n\n   This approach will introduce all GloVe words into your tokenizer's vocabulary, thus potentially improving the embedding matrix coverage. However, be cautious if you are using tf-idf, as this can dilute the frequency weights.\n\n2. **Separate Tokenizer for Prediction**: Use a separate tokenizer for prediction that is fitted on both the GloVe words and the original training texts. This allows you to expand the vocabulary without affecting the statistics used during training.\n\n3. **Use Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) Token**: You can configure the tokenizer to handle out-of-vocabulary words by using an OOV token. This token allows your model to have a placeholder for words not seen during training:\n\n   ```python\n   tokenizer = Tokenizer(oov_token=\"<OOV>\")\n   tokenizer.fit_on_texts(texts)\n   word_index = tokenizer.word_index\n   ```\n\n   With this, any word not in the training set will be replaced with the `<OOV>` token, and you can assign a zero or average vector to this token in your embedding matrix.\n\n4. **Dynamic Vocabulary Expansion**: You can dynamically expand your vocabulary during inference by checking if a word is in the GloVe dictionary and adding it to your tokenizer's word index if it's not already present:\n\n   ```python\n   def update_tokenizer_with_glove(tokenizer, sequence, embeddings_index):\n       new_words = [word for word in sequence if word not in tokenizer.word_index]\n       for word in new_words:\n           if word in embeddings_index:\n               tokenizer.word_index[word] = len(tokenizer.word_index) + 1\n       return tokenizer\n\n   # Update the tokenizer with new words before prediction\n   sequence = [\"Test sentence\"]\n   tokenizer = update_tokenizer_with_glove(tokenizer, sequence, embeddings_index)\n   sequence = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(sequence)\n   ```\n\n5. **Hybrid Model**: Consider using a hybrid model approach, where you use both pre-trained embeddings from GloVe and embeddings learned during training. This can help the model generalize better to new vocabulary.\n\nBy using these methods, you can expand your vocabulary coverage and make better predictions even when new words are encountered. Choose the method that best aligns with your overall modeling strategy and data processing pipeline."
