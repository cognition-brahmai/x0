After updating and upgrading my Ubuntu Server, installing Python 2.7, installing all the dependencies based on [http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/install_apt.html](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/install_apt.html), running `cp Makefile.config.example Makefile.config`, and uncommenting `cpu_only = 1` in `Makefile.config`, I run the `make` command in the caffe directory. However, I get the following error: \n\n```\nCXX src/caffe/util/hdf5.cpp\nin file include from src/caffe/util/hdf5.cpp:1:0:\n./include/caffe/util/hdf5.hpp:6:18: fatal error: hdf5.h: No such file or directory\ncompilation terminated \n\nMakefile:572 recipe for target '.build_release/src/caffe/util/hdf5.o'       \nfailed Make:*** [.build_release/src/caffe/util/hdf5.o] Error 1\n```\n\nThe error message indicates that `hdf5.h` is missing. Can anyone help me solve this problem?"

        "content": "The error message you're seeing indicates that the Caffe build process is unable to find the `hdf5.h` file, which is a header file for the HDF5 library. This library is used for handling large datasets. Here are the steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Install the HDF5 Library**: Ensure that the HDF5 library is installed on your system. You can install it using the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify Installation**: After installing, verify that the HDF5 library is correctly installed. You can do this by checking if the header file `hdf5.h` is present in the `/usr/include/hdf5/serial/` directory:\n\n   ```bash\n   ls /usr/include/hdf5/serial/hdf5.h\n   ```\n\n   If it is not in the expected location, you might need to find where it is installed using:\n\n   ```bash\n   find /usr/include/ -name hdf5.h\n   ```\n\n3. **Update Makefile.config**: If the header file is located in a non-standard directory, you might need to update the `Makefile.config` to include the path to the HDF5 headers and libraries. You can add something like this:\n\n   ```make\n   INCLUDE_DIRS := $(PYTHON_INCLUDE) /usr/local/include /usr/include/hdf5/serial\n   LIBRARY_DIRS := $(PYTHON_LIB) /usr/local/lib /usr/lib /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/hdf5/serial\n   ```\n\n4. **Recompile Caffe**: After making the above changes, try recompiling Caffe:\n\n   ```bash\n   make clean\n   make all\n   make test\n   make runtest\n   ```\n\n5. **Check Environment Variables**: Sometimes setting the `HDF5_DIR` environment variable can help. You can set it as follows:\n\n   ```bash\n   export HDF5_DIR=/usr/include/hdf5/serial\n   ```\n\n   Or wherever your HDF5 files are located.\n\n6. **Check for Multiple Versions**: If you have multiple versions of HDF5 installed, ensure that the paths in `Makefile.config` point to the correct version that you intend to use.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the error and successfully compile the Caffe framework. If you encounter further issues, feel free to ask for additional help!"
