I am familiar with the commands `cmd > file.txt` to redirect standard output to a truncated file, `cmd >> file.txt` to append standard output to a file, and `cmd &> file.txt` to redirect both standard output and standard error to a truncated file. However, I am not sure how to append both standard output and standard error to a file. I tried using `cmd &>> file.txt`, but it did not work for me. How can I achieve this?"

This is a common pattern for logging both outputs in a single file without truncating its existing content."
