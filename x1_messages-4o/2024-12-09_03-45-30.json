However, I am getting a \"NameError: name 'Graph' is not defined\" error. I understand these annotations are useful for both documentation and allowing the IDE to recognize argument and return types, thus enabling autocomplete. Is there a way to annotate the return type of a method with the class it is in?\n\nHere is the code I am working with:\n\n```python\nclass Graph:\n    def __init__(self, V: int, E: int, edges: list):\n        pass\n\n    @classmethod\n    def fromfile(cls, readobj: type(sys.stdin)):\n        pass\n\n    def V(self) -> int:\n        pass\n\n    def E(self) -> int:\n        pass\n\n    def reverse(self) -> Graph:\n        pass\n```\nThe problematic part is specifically this:\n\n```python\ndef reverse(self) -> Graph:\n    pass\n```\n\nThe error I am getting is:\n\n```python\ndef reverse(self) -> Graph:\nNameError: name 'Graph' is not defined\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that the class `Graph` is not yet fully defined when you're trying to use it in the type annotation. In Python 3.7 and later, you can resolve this by using a forward reference, which involves quoting the class name in the type annotation. This tells Python to treat it as a string that will be resolved later.\n\nHere's how you can modify your `reverse` method to use a forward reference:\n\n```python\nclass Graph:\n    def __init__(self, V: int, E: int, edges: list):\n        pass\n\n    @classmethod\n    def fromfile(cls, readobj: type(sys.stdin)):\n        pass\n\n    def V(self) -> int:\n        pass\n\n    def E(self) -> int:\n        pass\n\n    def reverse(self) -> 'Graph':  # Using a forward reference with quotes\n        pass\n```\n\nBy quoting `'Graph'`, you tell Python to resolve this type annotation later, once the class definition is complete. This approach is fully compatible with type checkers and IDEs, so you should still get the benefits of type hints such as autocompletion and type checking."
