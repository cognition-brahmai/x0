I tried the following:\n\n```python\nlist_of_values = [3,6]\ny = df[df['A'] in list_of_values]\n```\n\nBut it does not work.

        "content": "To subset a DataFrame based on a list of values, you can use the `isin()` method provided by Pandas. This method allows you to filter the DataFrame rows where column values are in the specified list. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'A': [5, 6, 3, 4], 'B': [1, 2, 3, 5]})\n\nlist_of_values = [3, 6]\ny = df[df['A'].isin(list_of_values)]\n\nprint(y)\n```\n\nThis will produce the desired output:\n\n```\n   A  B\n1  6  2\n2  3  3\n```\n\nThe `isin()` method checks each element in the column 'A' to see if it is in `list_of_values`, and returns a boolean Series. This boolean Series is then used to filter the DataFrame rows."
