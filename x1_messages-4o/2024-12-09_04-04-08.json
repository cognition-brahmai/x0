The compute capability table states that there can be 65535 blocks per grid dimension in CUDA compute capability 2.0. Does this mean the total number of blocks equals 65535*65535? Or does it mean that you can rearrange at most 65535 into a 1D grid of 65536 blocks or 2D grid of sqrt(65535) * sqrt(65535)?"

        "content": "In CUDA, the maximum number of blocks per grid is determined by the compute capability of the GPU. For compute capability 2.0 and higher, you can have a maximum of 65,535 blocks in each of the grid dimensions. This means:\n\n1. **1D Grid**: You can have up to 65,535 blocks.\n2. **2D Grid**: You can have up to 65,535 blocks in each dimension, resulting in a total of 65,535 * 65,535 blocks.\n3. **3D Grid**: Similarly, you can have up to 65,535 blocks in each dimension, leading to a theoretical maximum of 65,535 * 65,535 * 65,535 blocks.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the actual number of blocks you can practically launch will depend on other factors such as the resources required by each block (e.g., shared memory, registers) and the specific GPU architecture. Additionally, the maximum grid size in real-world applications may also be limited by the specific problem size, memory constraints, and the efficiency of the code.\n\nIn summary, for a 2D grid, you can indeed have up to 65,535 * 65,535 blocks, and for a 3D grid, you can have up to 65,535 * 65,535 * 65,535 blocks, assuming all other constraints are met."
