In Python 3.8, the code `a = [1, 2, 3]; print(*a, a.pop(0))` prints `2 3 1`, indicating that the pop operation is performed before unpacking. However, in Python 3.9, the same code prints `1 2 3 1`, which suggests that the pop operation is performed after unpacking. This change is also mirrored in list displays. For example, `a = [1, 2, 3]; b = [*a, a.pop(0)]; print(b)` prints `[2, 3, 1]` in Python 3.8 vs `[1, 2, 3, 1]` in Python 3.9. The Python 3.8 documentation mentions that \"The expressions are evaluated from left to right\", so I would expect the unpacking expression to happen first. Can you explain what caused this change in behavior, as I couldn't find any related information in the official Python changelog?"

        "content": "The change in behavior you're observing between Python 3.8 and Python 3.9 regarding the order of operations in expressions involving unpacking with the `*` operator and method calls like `pop()` is indeed intriguing. However, there is no explicit mention of this change in the Python changelog, and it may not necessarily be a bug or intentional change in behavior. Let's delve into how Python evaluates such expressions to provide some insight.\n\nIn Python, the order of evaluation of expressions is generally left-to-right. However, the unpacking operation with the `*` operator and function calls introduce some nuances. When you write an expression like `print(*a, a.pop(0))`, Python needs to evaluate both `*a` and `a.pop(0)` as arguments to the `print()` function. \n\nIn Python 3.8, the behavior you're seeing suggests that the evaluation of `a.pop(0)` is taking place before the unpacking of `*a`. This means that the `pop()` method modifies the list `a` before it is unpacked into the function call. \n\nOn the other hand, in Python 3.9, the behavior suggests that unpacking is being evaluated before the `a.pop(0)` expression. This means that the list `a` is unpacked into the function call first, and then `pop()` is called, which alters `a` after it has been unpacked.\n\nThis change in behavior might not be explicitly documented because it could be a result of an internal optimization or change in how argument evaluation order is handled, particularly with respect to the `*` unpacking operator. The order of evaluation for function arguments can sometimes be subject to change as Python's implementation evolves, especially when optimizations are introduced.\n\nIf this behavior impacts your code, the best approach would be to adjust the order of operations explicitly to ensure consistent results across Python versions. For instance, you can separate the operations:\n\n```python\na = [1, 2, 3]\nfirst_element = a.pop(0)\nprint(*a, first_element)\n```\n\nThis way, you control the order of execution explicitly, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of how Python handles the evaluation internally.\n\nIf you believe this change might be unintended or you want more details, you could consider filing an issue on the Python bug tracker or discussing it with the Python development community to gain more insights into why this change might have occurred."
