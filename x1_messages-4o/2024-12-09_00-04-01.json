Let's calculate the costs based on the current information in the table:\n\n1. **Durian:**\n   - Quantity: 5\n   - Price per Durian: $10\n   - Total Cost for Durian: \\( 5 \\times 10 = $50 \\)\n\n2. **Jackfruit:**\n   - Quantity: 8\n   - Price per Jackfruit: $7\n   - Total Cost for Jackfruit: \\( 8 \\times 7 = $56 \\)\n\n3. **Saffron:**\n   - Quantity: 1g\n   - Price per gram: $50/g\n   - Total Cost for Saffron: \\( 1 \\times 50 = $50 \\)\n\n4. **Vanilla Beans:**\n   - Quantity: 10\n   - Price per Vanilla Bean: $2.50\n   - Total Cost for Vanilla Beans: \\( 10 \\times 2.50 = $25 \\)\n\nNow, let's sum up the individual costs to find the total cost of the purchase:\n\n- Total Cost for Durian: $50\n- Total Cost for Jackfruit: $56\n- Total Cost for Saffron: $50\n- Total Cost for Vanilla Beans: $25\n\n**Total Cost of Purchase:** \\( 50 + 56 + 50 + 25 = $181 \\)\n\nSo, the total cost of the purchase is $181, with the individual costs as calculated above. If the quantities or prices change, simply adjust the calculations accordingly."
