The program should give feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low and keep track of the number of guesses. Once the correct number is guessed, the program should display the number of guesses it took and ask if the user wants to play again. Use a loop to allow the user to play multiple times if desired."

        "content": "To create a C++ program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and allows the user to guess the number, you can follow these steps. The program will give feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, keep track of the number of guesses, and allow the user to play multiple times if they wish.\n\nHere's a sample implementation:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cstdlib>  // For rand() and srand()\n#include <ctime>    // For time()\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    // Seed the random number generator\n    srand(static_cast<unsigned int>(time(0)));\n\n    bool playAgain;\n    do {\n        // Generate a random number between 1 and 100\n        int randomNumber = rand() % 100 + 1;\n        int guess;\n        int numberOfGuesses = 0;\n\n        cout << \"Welcome to the Guessing Game!\" << endl;\n        cout << \"I have generated a random number between 1 and 100.\" << endl;\n\n        // Game loop\n        while (true) {\n            cout << \"Enter your guess: \";\n            cin >> guess;\n            numberOfGuesses++;\n\n            if (guess < randomNumber) {\n                cout << \"Too low! Try again.\" << endl;\n            } else if (guess > randomNumber) {\n                cout << \"Too high! Try again.\" << endl;\n            } else {\n                cout << \"Congratulations! You guessed the number!\" << endl;\n                cout << \"It took you \" << numberOfGuesses << \" guesses.\" << endl;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Ask if the user wants to play again\n        char response;\n        cout << \"Do you want to play again? (y/n): \";\n        cin >> response;\n        playAgain = (response == 'y' || response == 'Y');\n        \n    } while (playAgain);\n\n    cout << \"Thank you for playing!\" << endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Random Number Generation**: \n   - The random number generator is seeded using the current time to ensure different sequences of random numbers each time the program runs.\n   - `rand() % 100 + 1` generates a random number between 1 and 100.\n\n2. **Game Loop**:\n   - The game loop continues until the user guesses the correct number.\n   - After each guess, the program tells the user if their guess was too low or too high.\n\n3. **Play Again Option**:\n   - After the user guesses the number correctly, they are asked if they want to play again.\n   - If the user enters 'y' or 'Y', the game starts over with a new random number.\n   - The loop continues based on the user's response.\n\n4. **User Input**:\n   - The program uses `cin` to read user input for both the guess and the decision to play again.\n\nThis program provides a simple text-based user interface for the guessing game. You can compile and run this program using a C++ compiler."
