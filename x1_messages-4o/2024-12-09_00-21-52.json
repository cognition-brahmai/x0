        "content": "In Python, memory management and cleanup are generally handled by the garbage collector, which automatically frees up memory when there are no more references to an object. However, there are some considerations for explicitly cleaning up variables.\n\nLet's evaluate the three options you've mentioned:\n\n1. **Using `del`:** \n   - The `del` statement removes a variable from the local or global namespace. Once you `del self.fps_display`, the reference to the object it was pointing to is removed, and if there are no other references to that object, it becomes eligible for garbage collection.\n   - Use `del` if you want to remove the variable name from the namespace, especially if you're sure you won't need to use it again.\n\n2. **Reassigning to `None`:**\n   - Setting `self.fps_display = None` keeps the variable in the namespace but changes its reference to `None`. This is useful if you might reinitialize `self.fps_display` later in your code.\n   - This approach is often more readable and can help prevent errors if you unintentionally try to access `self.fps_display` later in the code.\n\n3. **Using both:**\n   - Using both `del` and `self.fps_display = None` is generally redundant. Once you've `del` a variable, there's no need to assign it to `None` because it's already removed from the namespace.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- If you simply want to clear the reference and potentially reuse the variable later, use `self.fps_display = None`.\n- If you want to ensure the variable is completely removed from the namespace and won't be accessed again, use `del self.fps_display`.\n\nIn many cases, setting a variable to `None` is sufficient and clearer, especially for instance variables in classes, where you might want to reset the state. Choose based on the specific needs of your application and your code readability preferences."
