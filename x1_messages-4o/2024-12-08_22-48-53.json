        "content": "To efficiently find all valid words in a 2D array of characters, you can use a backtracking approach. This involves exploring all possible paths in the grid to form words, ensuring that each character is used only once per word and that the word meets the minimum length requirement of four characters. \n\nHere's how you can modify the Swift code to achieve this:\n\n```swift\nlet charGrid: [[Character]] = [\n    [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"],\n    [\"E\", \"F\", \"G\", \"H\"],\n    [\"I\", \"J\", \"K\", \"L\"]\n]\n\nfunc isWord(_ word: String) -> Bool {\n    // A placeholder function to check if a string is a valid word.\n    // You can replace this with an actual dictionary lookup.\n    return word.count >= 4 // For now, just check the minimum length.\n}\n\nfunc findValidWords(grid: [[Character]]) -> [String] {\n    var validWords: Set<String> = []\n    let rows = grid.count\n    let cols = grid[0].count\n    var visited = Array(repeating: Array(repeating: false, count: cols), count: rows)\n    \n    let directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]\n    \n    func dfs(_ row: Int, _ col: Int, _ currentWord: String) {\n        if isWord(currentWord) {\n            validWords.insert(currentWord)\n        }\n        \n        for (dr, dc) in directions {\n            let newRow = row + dr\n            let newCol = col + dc\n            if newRow >= 0 && newRow < rows && newCol >= 0 && newCol < cols && !visited[newRow][newCol] {\n                visited[newRow][newCol] = true\n                dfs(newRow, newCol, currentWord + String(grid[newRow][newCol]))\n                visited[newRow][newCol] = false\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    for row in 0..<rows {\n        for col in 0..<cols {\n            visited[row][col] = true\n            dfs(row, col, String(grid[row][col]))\n            visited[row][col] = false\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return Array(validWords)\n}\n\nlet words = findValidWords(grid: charGrid)\nprint(words)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Grid Setup**: We start by defining the input grid, which is a 2D array of characters. \n\n2. **Word Validation**: The `isWord` function is a placeholder that currently checks if a word is of at least four characters in length. You can replace this with a dictionary lookup to validate real words.\n\n3. **Backtracking with DFS**: We use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore all possible paths in the grid. For each cell, we recursively visit its neighbors to form potential words.\n\n4. **Tracking Visited Cells**: The `visited` array keeps track of the cells that have been used in the current path. This prevents reusing characters within a single word path.\n\n5. **Direction Vectors**: The `directions` array helps in moving to adjacent cells (8 possible directions).\n\n6. **Word Collection**: Valid words are collected in a `Set` to avoid duplicates. Finally, they are converted into an array for the output.\n\nThis code will output all potential words that meet the length requirement from the given grid. You should integrate a real dictionary lookup to further filter valid words."
