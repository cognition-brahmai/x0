Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nlist_a = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nlist_b = [5, 6, 7, 8]\n\nlist_c = list(zip(list_a, list_b))\n\nprint(list_c)\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n\n```\n[(1, 5), (2, 6), (3, 7), (4, 8)]\n```\n\nThe `zip` function pairs elements from `list_a` and `list_b` together, creating tuples of corresponding elements, and `list()` converts the result into a list of tuples."
