        "content": "You can use Python\u2019s built-in `socket` library to retrieve the hostname of the system. This is a straightforward method and works well for your purpose of identifying computers in a local network. Here\u2019s a simple way to do it:\n\n```python\nimport socket\n\ndef get_hostname():\n    try:\n        # Get the hostname of the current machine\n        hostname = socket.gethostname()\n        return hostname\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        return None\n\n# Example usage\nhostname = get_hostname()\nif hostname:\n    print(f\"The hostname of this system is: {hostname}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`socket.gethostname()`**: This function returns the hostname of the machine where the Python interpreter is currently executing. The hostname is usually set by the user or the system administrator and is a unique identifier for the computer in a network.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- If you need the fully qualified domain name (FQDN), you can use `socket.getfqdn()`.\n- Keep in mind that the hostname returned might not be unique in some networks, especially if there are default names or if users have not changed the default settings.\n- Ensure that your network allows hostname resolution if you intend to use hostnames for identifying machines."
