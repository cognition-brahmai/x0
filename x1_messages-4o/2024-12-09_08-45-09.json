I am attempting to use random.shuffle for this, but I am unsure of how to maintain the ordering between the two arrays. The dimensions of my image array are (image_number,channels,width,height), and the dimensions of my label array are (image_number,class_number)."

        "content": "To randomly shuffle a 4D array of training images and maintain the corresponding order of a 2D array of target labels, you can use the `numpy` library, which provides an efficient way to achieve this. Instead of using `random.shuffle`, you can use `numpy` to shuffle the arrays. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Assuming `images` is your 4D array with shape (image_number, channels, width, height)\n# and `labels` is your 2D array with shape (image_number, class_number)\n\n# Check if the number of images matches the number of labels\nassert images.shape[0] == labels.shape[0], \"Number of images and labels must be the same\"\n\n# Generate a permutation of indices based on the number of images\nindices = np.arange(images.shape[0])\nnp.random.shuffle(indices)\n\n# Shuffle the images and labels using the same permutation of indices\nshuffled_images = images[indices]\nshuffled_labels = labels[indices]\n\n# Now `shuffled_images` and `shuffled_labels` have been shuffled in unison\n```\n\nThis code works as follows:\n1. It creates an array of indices ranging from 0 to the number of images.\n2. It shuffles these indices randomly.\n3. It uses the shuffled indices to reorder both the images and the labels arrays, ensuring that each image and its corresponding label remain in sync.\n\nThis method is efficient and ensures that your data remains correctly paired."
