I'm successful in doing this but it creates a duplicate file. I would like to edit the file inline to avoid duplication. Can this be done using the CSV library or any other similar technique?\n\nHere's my code:\n\n```python\nwith open('tmpEmployeeDatabase-out.csv', 'w') as csvOutput:\n    writer = csv.writer(csvOutput, delimiter=',', quotechar='\"')\n\n    with open('tmpEmployeeDatabase.csv', 'r') as csvFile:\n        reader = csv.reader(csvFile, delimiter=',', quotechar='\"')\n\n        for row in reader:\n            row[0] = row[0].title()\n            writer.writerow(row)\n```\n\nI tried the following code to edit inline, but this appends the new records to the end of the file instead of replacing them.\n\n```python\nwith open('tmpEmployeeDatabase.csv', 'r+') as csvFile:\n    reader = csv.reader(csvFile, delimiter=',', quotechar='\"')\n    writer = csv.writer(csvFile, delimiter=',', quotechar='\"')\n\n    for row in reader:\n        row[1] = row[1].title()\n        writer.writerow(row)\n```"

        "content": "Modifying a CSV file inline is a bit tricky because CSV files are essentially plain text files, and direct modification requires careful handling of file pointers. However, it can be done by reading the content, modifying it, and writing it back, ensuring the file is truncated to avoid any leftover content.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to modify the CSV file inline:\n\n1. Read the file content into memory.\n2. Modify the content as needed.\n3. Write the modified content back to the same file, truncating the file to remove any existing content.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\n# Read the file into memory\nwith open('tmpEmployeeDatabase.csv', 'r') as csvFile:\n    reader = csv.reader(csvFile, delimiter=',', quotechar='\"')\n    rows = list(reader)  # Store all rows in memory\n\n# Modify the rows as needed\nfor row in rows:\n    row[0] = row[0].title()  # Update the first column\n\n# Write the modified rows back to the same file\nwith open('tmpEmployeeDatabase.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvFile:\n    writer = csv.writer(csvFile, delimiter=',', quotechar='\"')\n    writer.writerows(rows)  # Write all modified rows back\n\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Read and Store in Memory**: The entire file is read and stored in memory. This approach works fine for small to moderate-sized files, but may not be efficient for very large files.\n- **Modify in Memory**: Modifications are applied to the rows stored in memory.\n- **Overwrite the File**: Open the file in write mode to overwrite its content with the modified data. The `newline=''` parameter is used to ensure that newlines are handled correctly on different platforms.\n\nThis method ensures that the file is effectively updated inline without creating a duplicate file."
