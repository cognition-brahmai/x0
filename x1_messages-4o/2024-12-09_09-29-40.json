        "content": "To print the numbers between 1 and 10 using a for loop in Java, you can write a simple program like this:\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Loop from 1 to 10\n        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {\n            // Print the current number\n            System.out.println(i);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the code:\n\n- `public class Main`: This declares a class named `Main`. In Java, all code must be inside a class.\n- `public static void main(String[] args)`: This is the main method, which is the entry point for any Java application.\n- `for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)`: This is a for loop that initializes `i` to 1, checks if `i` is less than or equal to 10, and increments `i` by 1 after each loop iteration.\n- `System.out.println(i)`: This prints the current value of `i` to the console.\n\nWhen you run this program, it will print the numbers 1 through 10, each on a new line."
