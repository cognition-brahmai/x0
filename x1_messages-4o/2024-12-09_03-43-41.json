        "content": "Certainly! In Django, when you're working with URL configurations, it's often useful to see the entire URL pattern list, including those that are included from other modules. While the Django debugging 404 page provides some insight, it doesn't show included URL configurations. However, you can programmatically list all URL patterns, including those from included modules, by writing a custom management command or a simple script.\n\nHere's a straightforward way to print all URL patterns in your Django project:\n\n1. **Create a Django management command**: This will allow you to list all URL patterns directly from the command line.\n\n   First, create a new directory `management/commands` inside one of your apps (e.g., `myapp`). Then, create a new Python file for the command, such as `list_urls.py`.\n\n   Your directory structure should look like this:\n   \n   ```\n   myapp/\n       management/\n           commands/\n               __init__.py\n               list_urls.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Write the command**: In `list_urls.py`, implement the logic to traverse and print the URL patterns.\n\n   ```python\n   from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand\n   from django.urls import URLPattern, URLResolver\n   from django.conf import settings\n   from importlib import import_module\n\n   def list_urls(lis, acc=''):\n       for entry in lis:\n           if isinstance(entry, URLPattern):\n               print(f\"{acc}{entry.pattern.regex.pattern}\")\n           elif isinstance(entry, URLResolver):\n               print(f\"{acc}{entry.pattern.regex.pattern}\")\n               list_urls(entry.url_patterns, acc + '    ')\n\n   class Command(BaseCommand):\n       help = \"List all URLs in the project\"\n\n       def handle(self, *args, **kwargs):\n           urlconf = import_module(settings.ROOT_URLCONF)\n           list_urls(urlconf.urlpatterns)\n   ```\n\n3. **Run the command**: Execute this command using Django's management command utility.\n\n   ```shell\n   python manage.py list_urls\n   ```\n\nThis command will recursively traverse all URL patterns in your Django project, including those that are included from other modules, and print them out in a structured manner.\n\nThis approach gives you a comprehensive view of all configured URLs in your Django project, making it easier to debug and understand the routing logic of your application."
