Currently, I'm using:\n\n```python\nfirst = l[0]\nrest = l[1:]\n```\n\nI know that in Python 3, I can use the following code:\n\n```python\nfirst, *rest = l\n```\n\nBut, is there a more elegant way to do this in Python 2.6?"

However, your current approach is already quite straightforward and Pythonic for Python 2.6. \n\nIf you're looking for a slightly different approach, you could define a helper function to encapsulate the logic and make your code more readable wherever you need this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef split_first(lst):\n    if not lst:\n        return None, []\n    return lst[0], lst[1:]\n\n# Usage\nl = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nfirst, rest = split_first(l)\n```\n\nThis function handles the edge case of an empty list by returning `None` for the first element and an empty list for the rest, making your code a bit more robust. \n\nHowever, in terms of elegance and conciseness, your original method is quite effective for Python 2.6."
