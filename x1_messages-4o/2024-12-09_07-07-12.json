        "content": "The error message you're encountering suggests that Python is unable to find the `ImageTk` module. This module is part of the `Pillow` library, which is a fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL). To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that `Pillow` is installed in your Python environment. Here's how you can do that:\n\n1. **Install Pillow**: You can install the `Pillow` library using `pip`, which is the package manager for Python. Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install Pillow\n   ```\n\n   If you are using Python 3, you might want to specify `pip3` instead:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip3 install Pillow\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify Installation**: Once the installation is complete, you can verify that `Pillow` is installed by running a Python interactive shell and trying to import `ImageTk`:\n\n   ```python\n   >>> from PIL import Image, ImageTk\n   ```\n\n   If you don't encounter any errors, the installation was successful.\n\n3. **Modify Your Code**: Make sure that your import statement in the code is correct. Instead of `import ImageTk`, it should be:\n\n   ```python\n   from PIL import Image, ImageTk\n   ```\n\n4. **Check Your Environment**: Ensure that you're running your script in the same environment where `Pillow` is installed. If you're using a virtual environment, activate it before running your script.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the \"No module named ImageTk\" error and successfully run your Python code. If you continue to face issues, please let me know!"
