        "content": "What is the best practice for implementing logging in Django Celery? I've set up logging in settings.py to go to the console, which works fine as I'm hosting on Heroku. However, when a task in tasks.py calls a method in another module, I get duplicate log entries. I tried using `CELERY_HIJACK_ROOT_LOGGER = False` to just use the Django logging but this didn't work. Also, I would like to retain the \"PoolWorker-6\" bit in the log. How do I get the task name to display in the log entry from Celery, as the documentation seems to indicate that it should?"

        "content": "To implement logging effectively in Django Celery and avoid duplicate log entries, you can follow these best practices:\n\n1. **Configure Logging Properly**: Ensure that your logging configuration in `settings.py` is set up to handle both Django and Celery logs. You can do this by configuring a separate logger for Celery tasks.\n\n2. **Avoid Duplicate Log Entries**: To prevent duplicate logs, you should avoid having both Celery and Django loggers configured to handle the same log messages. Setting `CELERY_HIJACK_ROOT_LOGGER = False` is a good step, but you also need to ensure that your logging configuration doesn't inadvertently duplicate logs.\n\n3. **Use Task-Specific Logging**: In your Celery tasks, you can use `self.get_logger()` to get a logger instance specific to the task. This can help in managing logs more effectively.\n\n4. **Configure Log Formatters**: To include task names and worker information like \"PoolWorker-6\" in your log entries, you need to configure the log formatter in `settings.py`. You can include the task name and worker information in the log format.\n\nHere's an example configuration:\n\n```python\n# settings.py\n\nLOGGING = {\n    'version': 1,\n    'disable_existing_loggers': False,\n    'formatters': {\n        'verbose': {\n            'format': '{levelname} {asctime} {module} {process:d} {thread:d} {message}',\n            'style': '{',\n        },\n        'simple': {\n            'format': '{levelname} {message}',\n            'style': '{',\n        },\n        'celery': {\n            'format': '[%(asctime)s: %(levelname)s/%(processName)s] [%(task_name)s(%(task_id)s)] %(message)s',\n        },\n    },\n    'handlers': {\n        'console': {\n            'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',\n            'formatter': 'celery',\n        },\n    },\n    'loggers': {\n        'django': {\n            'handlers': ['console'],\n            'level': 'INFO',\n        },\n        'celery': {\n            'handlers': ['console'],\n            'level': 'INFO',\n            'propagate': False,\n        },\n    },\n}\n\n# Ensure that CELERY_HIJACK_ROOT_LOGGER is set to False\nCELERY_HIJACK_ROOT_LOGGER = False\n```\n\n5. **Include Task Metadata**: To include the task name in your logs, you can use `@task(bind=True)` in your task definition and access `self.name` to log the task name.\n\nHere's an example of a Celery task:\n\n```python\nfrom celery import shared_task\n\n@shared_task(bind=True)\ndef my_task(self, *args, **kwargs):\n    logger = self.get_logger()\n    logger.info(f'Executing task {self.name}')\n    # Your task logic here\n```\n\nBy properly configuring the logging format and handlers, you can effectively manage and display logs for Celery tasks without duplication and include all necessary information in your log entries."
