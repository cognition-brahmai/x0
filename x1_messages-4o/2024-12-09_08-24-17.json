My dictionary is in the following format:\n\n```python\nmy_dict = {id1: val1, id2: val2, id3: val3, ...}\n```\n\nI want to convert this into a DataFrame with two columns named 'business_id' and 'business_code'. I attempted to do this by using the following code:\n\n```python\nbusiness_df = DataFrame.from_dict(my_dict,orient='index',columns=['business_id','business_code'])\n```\n\nHowever, I received an error message saying: `TypeError: from_dict() got an unexpected keyword argument 'columns'`. How can I fix this?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the `DataFrame.from_dict()` method does not accept a `columns` argument when the `orient='index'` option is used. To create a DataFrame with specific column names from a dictionary where keys and values correspond to the desired columns, you should first convert the dictionary into a list of tuples or another suitable structure.\n\nYou can achieve this by using the following approach with `pd.DataFrame()` directly:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\nmy_dict = {'id1': 'val1', 'id2': 'val2', 'id3': 'val3'}\n\n# Convert the dictionary into a list of tuples and then create a DataFrame\nbusiness_df = pd.DataFrame(list(my_dict.items()), columns=['business_id', 'business_code'])\n\nprint(business_df)\n```\n\nThis code will create a DataFrame with two columns, `business_id` and `business_code`, with the dictionary keys becoming the values of the `business_id` column and the dictionary values becoming the values of the `business_code` column."
