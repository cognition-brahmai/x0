        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"RuntimeError: Trying to backward through the graph a second time, but the buffers have already been freed,\" typically occurs when PyTorch tries to compute gradients for a computation graph that has already been discarded. This happens because by default, PyTorch frees the computation graph after calling `backward()` to save memory.\n\nHere are a few steps to help you resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check for Multiple Backpropagations:**\n   Ensure that you're not calling `.backward()` multiple times on the same graph without specifying `retain_graph=True`. In your case, the issue might be related to how you are handling the loss computation with the `map` function. The `map` function is lazy and might be causing unexpected behavior if `loss.backward()` is called multiple times in some context.\n\n2. **Modify Your Loss Function:**\n   You should ensure that the loss computation within `_loss` does not retain unnecessary computation graphs. If you're iterating over outputs and sessions using `map`, ensure that all operations within the loop are detached from the graph as needed. You might need to switch to a list comprehension or a loop for better control:\n   \n   ```python\n   def _loss(outputs, session, items):\n       losses = []\n       for output, target in zip(outputs, session):\n           pos = torch.from_numpy(np.array([items[target[\"click\"]]])).float()\n           neg = torch.from_numpy(np.array([items[idx] for idx in target[\"suggest_list\"] if idx != target[\"click\"]])).float()\n\n           if USE_CUDA:\n               pos, neg = pos.cuda(), neg.cuda()\n\n           pos, neg = Variable(pos), Variable(neg)\n\n           pos = F.cosine_similarity(output, pos)\n           if neg.size()[0] == 0:\n               losses.append(torch.mean(F.logsigmoid(pos)))\n           else:\n               neg = F.cosine_similarity(output.expand_as(neg), neg)\n               losses.append(torch.mean(F.logsigmoid(pos - neg)))\n\n       return -torch.mean(torch.stack(losses))\n   ```\n\n3. **Check for Shared Variables:**\n   If `outputs` and `session` are reused in multiple iterations, ensure that no gradients from previous iterations are retained unintentionally. Detach any variable from the graph if it should not contribute to the gradient computation in subsequent steps.\n\n4. **Ensure Proper Variable Usage:**\n   If `Variable` usage is from an older PyTorch version, and you're using a newer version, ensure you're using tensors appropriately since `Variable` has been deprecated. Simply use tensors that require gradients, like so:\n   \n   ```python\n   pos = torch.tensor(np.array([items[target[\"click\"]]]), dtype=torch.float32, requires_grad=True)\n   neg = torch.tensor(np.array([items[idx] for idx in target[\"suggest_list\"] if idx != target[\"click\"]]), dtype=torch.float32, requires_grad=True)\n   ```\n\n5. **Debugging:**\n   If the error persists, try printing the shapes and values of your tensors to verify that they are as expected, and ensure that no operation inadvertently modifies the computation graph in undesired ways.\n\n6. **Retain Graph (Optional):**\n   If you truly need to call `backward` multiple times on the same graph, you can specify `retain_graph=True` in `loss.backward()`. However, this is generally not recommended unless necessary since it increases memory usage:\n\n   ```python\n   loss.backward(retain_graph=True)\n   ```\n\nBy addressing these points, you should be able to resolve the issue with your custom loss function and avoid the runtime error you're experiencing."
