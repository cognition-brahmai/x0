        "content": "To convert the fraction \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\) to a decimal, you can use long division and the bar notation method. Here's how you do it:\n\n### Long Division Method:\n\n1. **Set up the division**: Divide 7 by 8. Since 7 is less than 8, you begin by adding a decimal point and a zero, making it 70.\n\n2. **Divide**: \n   - 8 goes into 70 eight times (since \\( 8 \\times 8 = 64 \\)), leaving a remainder of 6.\n   - Bring down another zero, making it 60.\n\n3. **Continue dividing**:\n   - 8 goes into 60 seven times (since \\( 8 \\times 7 = 56 \\)), leaving a remainder of 4.\n   - Bring down another zero, making it 40.\n\n4. **Repeat the process**:\n   - 8 goes into 40 five times (since \\( 8 \\times 5 = 40 \\)), leaving no remainder.\n\nSo, the decimal representation of \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\) is 0.875.\n\n### Bar Notation Method:\n\nBar notation refers to expressing a repeating decimal with a line over the repeating digits. In this case, \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\) is a terminating decimal, so there is no repetition. The bar notation isn't necessary here, but if it were repeating, you would place a line over the repeating digit(s). For example, if a decimal were 0.333..., it would be written as \\( 0.\\overline{3} \\).\n\nHowever, for \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\), since it terminates as 0.875, there is no repeating pattern, and therefore no bar notation is used.\n\nThus, \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\) as a decimal is 0.875."
