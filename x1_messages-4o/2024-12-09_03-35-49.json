I have the following setup where I plot a graph using numpy and matplotlib:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\nx = np.arange(5)\ny = np.exp(x)\nfig1 = plt.figure()\nax1 = fig1.add_subplot(111)\nax1.plot(x, y)\n```\nHowever, I am encountering errors while trying to add a title to the plot or the subplot. When I tried to use the 'title()' method on the 'Figure' object like `fig1.title('foo')`, I received an AttributeError: 'Figure' object has no attribute 'title'. Similarly, when I tried to use the 'title()' method on the 'AxesSubplot' object like `ax1.title('foo')`, I received a TypeError: 'Text' object is not callable. How can I appropriately use the object-oriented programming interface to matplotlib to set these attributes? \n\nAlso, where can I find the hierarchy of classes in matplotlib and their corresponding methods?"

        "content": "To set a title using the object-oriented interface in Matplotlib, you should use the `set_title()` method on the `Axes` object. The `Figure` object does not have a `title()` method, which is why you encountered the `AttributeError`. The `Axes` object has a method called `set_title()` which you can use to set the title for the subplot. Here's how you can modify your code to add a title:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\nx = np.arange(5)\ny = np.exp(x)\nfig1 = plt.figure()\nax1 = fig1.add_subplot(111)\nax1.plot(x, y)\n\n# Set the title for the Axes\nax1.set_title('My Plot Title')\n```\n\nMake sure you call `set_title()` on the `Axes` object (`ax1` in this case) instead of trying to call `title()` on it. \n\nRegarding the class hierarchy and methods in Matplotlib, the official Matplotlib documentation is a great resource. It provides detailed information about the classes and methods available:\n\n- The [Matplotlib API documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/index.html) lists all the classes, methods, and functions.\n- The [Pyplot API](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/pyplot_summary.html) provides a summary of the functions available in the `matplotlib.pyplot` module.\n- The [object-oriented API](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/lifecycle.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-introductory-lifecycle-py) section in the tutorials offers insight into using Matplotlib's object-oriented approach effectively.\n\nThese resources should help you understand the class hierarchy and the methods available in Matplotlib."
