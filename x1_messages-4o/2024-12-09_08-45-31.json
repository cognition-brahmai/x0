I would like to write the code as follows:\n\n```python\nclass AbstractFoo(metaclass=ABCMeta):\n\n    @property\n    @abstractmethod\n    def bar(self):\n        pass\n\nclass Foo(AbstractFoo):\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.bar = 3\n```\n\nInstead of this:\n\n```python\nclass Foo(AbstractFoo):\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._bar = 3\n\n    @property\n    def bar(self):\n        return self._bar\n\n    @bar.setter\n    def setbar(self, bar):\n        self._bar = bar\n\n    @bar.deleter\n    def delbar(self):\n        del self._bar\n```\n\nI find properties are handy, but for a simple attribute requiring no computation, they seem overkill. This is particularly important for abstract classes which will be subclassed and implemented by the user. I don't want to force someone to use @property when he could have just written self.foo = foo in the __init__. What is the best way to proceed?"

        "content": "If you want to define an abstract attribute in an abstract class without using properties and allow subclasses to implement it directly as a simple attribute, you can use a common pattern involving the `ABCMeta` metaclass and simply document the requirement for the attribute. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. Define the abstract attribute in the abstract class, but don't implement it. Simply use a comment or a docstring to indicate that this attribute should be implemented by subclasses.\n\n2. In the subclass, you can directly set the attribute in the `__init__` method without using properties.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod\n\nclass AbstractFoo(metaclass=ABCMeta):\n    # Indicate that 'bar' should be defined by subclasses\n    bar = None\n\n    @abstractmethod\n    def some_method(self):\n        pass\n\nclass Foo(AbstractFoo):\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Directly assign the attribute\n        self.bar = 3\n\n    def some_method(self):\n        print(\"Implementing some_method\")\n\n# Usage\nfoo = Foo()\nprint(foo.bar)  # Outputs: 3\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Documentation**: Use comments or docstrings to clearly indicate that subclasses should define the attribute. This is important for maintainability and for other developers who might work with your code.\n\n- **Abstract Method**: Keep at least one abstract method in the abstract class to enforce that it cannot be instantiated directly.\n\n- **Flexibility**: This approach gives flexibility to subclass implementers to define the attribute as they see fit, without the overhead of properties if not needed.\n\nBy following this pattern, you maintain the abstraction and enforce subclass implementation, but you also allow for simplicity in attribute definition without the need for properties."
