In some Python files, I have seen the first two lines begin with:\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/python\n# -*- encoding: <encoding name> -*-\n```\n\nHowever, according to PEP 263, it should be:\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/python\n# -*- coding: <encoding name> -*-\n```\n\nHere, 'encoding' is used instead of 'coding'. Is 'encoding' acceptable because the regex used is lazy? Or does it represent another way to declare the file encoding? This is unclear to me because PEP 263 only mentions 'coding', not 'encoding'."

        "content": "According to PEP 263, the correct way to declare the encoding of a Python source file is by using the `coding` keyword, not `encoding`. The PEP specifies that the encoding declaration must be in the form of:\n\n```python\n# -*- coding: <encoding name> -*-\n```\n\nThis declaration should be placed on the first or second line of the file. The keyword `coding` is what PEP 263 officially recognizes to indicate the file encoding. Using `encoding` instead of `coding` is not standard and is not supported by PEP 263. \n\nThe Python interpreter specifically looks for the `coding` keyword to determine the encoding of the file. While the line you mentioned with `encoding` might be present in some files, it does not conform to the PEP 263 guidelines. It may be ignored by the interpreter, and therefore, it is not a reliable way to declare encoding.\n\nIt's important to adhere to the standard to ensure that your code is correctly interpreted by different Python environments and tools that follow PEP 263. So, always use `coding` when specifying file encoding."
