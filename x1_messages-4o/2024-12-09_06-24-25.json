This is a common convention in Python to indicate that the variable is intentionally being ignored.\n\nIn the context of your code snippet:\n\n```python\nif tbh.bag:\n    n = 0\n    for _ in tbh.bag.atom_set():\n        n += 1\n```\n\nThe usage of `_` in the `for` loop signifies that the loop is iterating over each item in `tbh.bag.atom_set()`, but the actual item is not needed for the operations within the loop. The purpose of this loop is to simply count the number of elements in `tbh.bag.atom_set()`, incrementing `n` by 1 for each item. Since the items themselves are not used, `_` is used as a placeholder to show that the value of each item is being deliberately ignored."
