        "content": "Certainly! To decode the hidden message from the given string of numbers using the provided formula, we need to take the following steps:\n\n1. Convert each number into its corresponding letter based on the position in the alphabet (e.g., 1 = 'a', 2 = 'b', ..., 26 = 'z').\n2. Group these letters into words. The length of each word isn't provided, so we'll assume each number corresponds to a single-letter word for the sake of this exercise.\n3. Calculate the power level of each word using the formula: `(position of the letter in the alphabet) + (number of letters in the word)`.\n4. Sort the words in descending order of their calculated power levels.\n5. Extract the first letter of each word in the sorted order to form the hidden message.\n\nHere's a Swift function that implements this logic:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\n// Helper function to convert a number to its corresponding letter\nfunc numberToLetter(_ number: Int) -> String {\n    let alphabet = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n    if number >= 1 && number <= 26 {\n        let index = alphabet.index(alphabet.startIndex, offsetBy: number - 1)\n        return String(alphabet[index])\n    }\n    return \"\"\n}\n\n// Function to decode the hidden message\nfunc decodeHiddenMessage(from numbers: [Int]) -> String {\n    // Convert numbers to letters\n    let letters = numbers.map { numberToLetter($0) }\n    \n    // Create words from letters (in this example, each letter is a word)\n    let words = letters.map { letter in\n        return (letter, (letter.unicodeScalars.first!.value - 96) + 1) // Calculate power level\n    }\n    \n    // Sort words by their power level in descending order\n    let sortedWords = words.sorted { $0.1 > $1.1 }\n    \n    // Extract the first letter of each word to form the hidden message\n    let hiddenMessage = sortedWords.map { $0.0 }.joined()\n    \n    return hiddenMessage\n}\n\n// Example usage\nlet numbers = [7, 15, 21, 12, 4, 20, 19, 9, 14, 7, 20, 18, 1, 3, 20, 9, 15, 14]\nlet hiddenMessage = decodeHiddenMessage(from: numbers)\nprint(\"Hidden Message: \\(hiddenMessage)\")\n```\n\nThis function takes the list of numbers, converts each to a letter, calculates a \"power level\" for each letter (treated as a single-letter word), sorts them by power level, and then constructs the hidden message from the sorted letters.\n\nPlease note that the provided solution assumes each number corresponds to a single-letter word for simplicity, as the length of each word is not specified in your problem description. If there are specific word lengths, additional context would be needed to adjust the logic accordingly."
