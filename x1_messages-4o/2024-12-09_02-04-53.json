I noticed this issue while viewing this [iPython notebook](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/udacity/2_fullyconnected.ipynb). How can I remove this red highlighting?\n\n![ipython red text](https://i.stack.imgur.com/SOPI0.png)"

        "content": "The red highlighting you're seeing in your IPython notebook is likely related to syntax highlighting, and it could be due to a few reasons:\n\n1. **Syntax Errors**: Red highlighting often indicates a syntax error in the code. Double-check the code in those cells for any missing brackets, incorrect indentation, or other syntax issues.\n\n2. **Notebook Metadata or Theme**: Sometimes, the theme or syntax highlighting settings in Jupyter Notebook might cause certain text to appear in red. You can try changing the notebook's theme or syntax highlighting settings:\n   - Go to the menu bar and click on **View** > **Cell Toolbar** > **None** to reset any toolbar settings.\n   - If you have installed Jupyter themes or extensions, try reverting to the default theme by running:\n     ```bash\n     !jt -r\n     ```\n     This command resets Jupyter themes to default.\n\n3. **Markdown vs. Code Cells**: Ensure that the cell type is set correctly. Sometimes, if a markdown cell is mistakenly set to a code cell or vice versa, the text might be highlighted incorrectly. You can change the cell type by selecting the cell and using the menu: **Cell** > **Cell Type** > **Markdown** or **Code**.\n\n4. **Language-specific Keywords**: Some keywords or variables might be highlighted differently depending on the language-specific syntax rules. Make sure that you're using the correct syntax and language conventions.\n\n5. **Browser Cache or Rendering**: Occasionally, browser caching or rendering issues might cause unexpected highlighting. Try clearing your browser cache or opening the notebook in a different browser.\n\nIf none of these solutions work, consider updating Jupyter Notebook, as there might be a bug in the version you're using that has been fixed in later releases. You can update Jupyter using the following command:\n```bash\npip install --upgrade jupyter\n```\n\nAfter trying these steps, if the issue persists, it might be worth checking the Jupyter Notebook's GitHub repository or forums for any known issues related to your specific version."
