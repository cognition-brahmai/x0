        "content": "The issue you're experiencing may be related to the OpenBLAS warning, which indicates that the application could not determine the L2 cache size on the system. This warning alone might not be the root cause of the problem since OpenBLAS can often work despite such warnings. However, it could potentially impact the performance of certain operations, especially if your application relies on numerical operations provided by OpenBLAS (often through NumPy or similar libraries).\n\nHere are some steps and considerations to help resolve the issue and get your application running on Google Cloud AppEngine:\n\n1. **Update Dependencies**: Ensure that your dependencies are up-to-date. There have been many updates since the versions you're using, and newer versions might have fixed compatibility issues:\n   ```txt\n   Flask>=1.1.2\n   dash>=1.20.0\n   dash-html-components>=1.1.4\n   dash-core-components>=1.16.0\n   dash-table>=4.11.3\n   gunicorn>=20.1.0\n   google-cloud-pubsub>=2.7.0\n   requests>=2.26.0\n   pandas>=1.3.3\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Dash Configuration**: Ensure that your Dash application is correctly configured to run on a server environment. Make sure you're using the `app.server` attribute when specifying the WSGI server entry point in `app.yaml`.\n\n3. **Environment Variables**: Confirm that any necessary environment variables or configurations required by your application are correctly set.\n\n4. **Instance Class**: Consider using a higher instance class if your application demands more CPU or memory resources. You might want to try an instance class like `F4_1G` for more resources.\n\n5. **OpenBLAS Configuration**: While the OpenBLAS warning might not be critical, you can attempt to suppress it by setting the `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS` environment variable. This can be done in your `app.yaml`:\n\n   ```yaml\n   env_variables:\n     OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS: \"1\"\n   ```\n\n6. **Logging and Monitoring**: Utilize Google Cloud's logging and monitoring tools to gather more information about why your application might be stuck loading. This can provide insights into possible errors or performance bottlenecks.\n\n7. **Health Checks**: Ensure that your application is properly configured to pass health checks. Misconfigured health checks can lead to instances being terminated or not serving traffic.\n\n8. **Isolation and Testing**: If possible, isolate parts of your application to test and identify where the issue arises. For example, confirm if it's a specific route or functionality that's causing the problem.\n\n9. **Local Simulation**: Try to simulate the AppEngine environment locally using tools like `gcloud` or Docker to replicate the issue and test potential solutions.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue preventing your application from running correctly on Google Cloud AppEngine. If the problem persists, consider reaching out to Google Cloud support for more specific assistance."
