I have installed pygame 1.9.4 and I am running python 2.7.10, same as my old MacBook where the code works fine. However, when I run the following code, I only get a blank screen, instead of an expected red screen. What could be causing this?\n\nThe code I'm using is:\n\n```python\nimport pygame\npygame.init()\n\nscreen = pygame.display.set_mode((800,600))\n\nwhile True:\n    for event in pygame.event.get():\n        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n            quit()\n\n    screen.fill((255,0,0))\n    pygame.display.update()\n\npygame.quit()\n```\n\nI'm writing the script in Sublime Text and running the program in Terminal. I believe I have installed pygame in the exact same manner as I did on my old MacBook, the only difference seems to be the operating system. Any idea what I might be doing wrong?"

        "content": "There are a few potential issues that could lead to a blank screen when running your Pygame code on a new MacBook. Let's go through a checklist of things you can try to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Python and Pygame Versions**:\n   - Ensure that both Python and Pygame are correctly installed and compatible. Since you are using Python 2.7.10, which is quite old, consider using a virtual environment with a more recent version of Python, like Python 3.x, as Python 2 has reached end-of-life.\n\n2. **Event Loop Handling**:\n   - The `quit()` function in your code should be replaced with `pygame.quit()` followed by `sys.exit()` to properly close the application. You need to import the `sys` module for this.\n\n3. **Update Pygame**:\n   - Consider updating Pygame to a more recent version. Pygame 1.9.4 is quite outdated, and newer versions might have better compatibility with modern macOS environments.\n\n4. **macOS Compatibility**:\n   - Ensure your macOS system is updated. Sometimes, graphics or compatibility issues arise from outdated system software.\n\n5. **Check for Missing Updates**:\n   - Run the following commands in your terminal to ensure that your system and Pygame are up to date:\n     ```bash\n     pip install --upgrade pip\n     pip install --upgrade pygame\n     ```\n\n6. **Test Basic Pygame Functionality**:\n   - Run a basic Pygame window to check if the issue is with the Pygame installation or your code. Use the following minimal example:\n     ```python\n     import pygame\n     pygame.init()\n     screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))\n     running = True\n     while running:\n         for event in pygame.event.get():\n             if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n                 running = False\n         screen.fill((0, 255, 0))  # Fill with green to see if it updates\n         pygame.display.flip()\n     pygame.quit()\n     ```\n\n7. **Graphics Drivers**:\n   - Ensure your MacBook's graphics drivers are up to date. Sometimes, rendering issues can arise from outdated drivers.\n\n8. **Permission Issues**:\n   - Ensure that Sublime Text and Terminal have the necessary permissions to access the display. Check `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy` and make sure they are listed under `Accessibility` or `Full Disk Access`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify the source of the issue and resolve it. If the problem persists, consider posting on Pygame or macOS forums with specific details about your setup for more targeted assistance."
