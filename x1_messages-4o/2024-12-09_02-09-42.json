I tried using `time.tzname` to get the local timezone name, but the name it returns is not compatible with `pytz.timezone`. For example, the method `time.tzname` returns `('CST', 'CST')` on my system, but 'CST' can represent several different timezones, including Central Time Zone (North America), China Standard Time, Chungyuan Standard Time, and Australian Central Standard Time (ACST). How can I accurately retrieve the system timezone and pass it to `pytz.timezone`?"

Here's how you can use it:\n\n1. First, install the `tzlocal` library if you haven't already. You can do this using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install tzlocal\n   ```\n\n2. Then, you can use the following code to get the local timezone and use it with `pytz`:\n\n   ```python\n   import pytz\n   from tzlocal import get_localzone\n\n   # Get the local timezone\n   local_tz = get_localzone()\n\n   # Print the timezone\n   print(\"Local Timezone:\", local_tz)\n\n   # Use with pytz\n   timezone = pytz.timezone(str(local_tz))\n   print(\"Pytz Timezone:\", timezone)\n   ```\n\nThis code will correctly identify the system's local timezone and provide a `pytz` timezone object that you can use in your application. The `tzlocal` library handles the complexity of determining the correct timezone name compatible with `pytz`."
