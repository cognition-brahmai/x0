Use the prime numbers to calculate the cost of the remaining domains. Good luck!"

        "content": "To solve this domain puzzle, we need to first generate a list of prime numbers using the given shell command:\n\n```shell\nseq 2 19 | factor | awk '{print $2}'\n```\n\nThis command will generate the sequence of numbers from 2 to 19, and for each number, it will factorize it and print the smallest prime factor. Let's list the numbers from 2 to 19 and determine which ones are prime:\n\n- 2 (prime)\n- 3 (prime)\n- 4 (not prime, factors are 2, 2)\n- 5 (prime)\n- 6 (not prime, factors are 2, 3)\n- 7 (prime)\n- 8 (not prime, factors are 2, 2, 2)\n- 9 (not prime, factors are 3, 3)\n- 10 (not prime, factors are 2, 5)\n- 11 (prime)\n- 12 (not prime, factors are 2, 2, 3)\n- 13 (prime)\n- 14 (not prime, factors are 2, 7)\n- 15 (not prime, factors are 3, 5)\n- 16 (not prime, factors are 2, 2, 2, 2)\n- 17 (prime)\n- 18 (not prime, factors are 2, 3, 3)\n- 19 (prime)\n\nThe prime numbers from this sequence are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19.\n\nWe are given that the cost of a .com domain is 40, which is not relevant to calculating the cost of the other domains. Instead, we need to assign prime numbers to each of the remaining domains: .org, .net, .info, and .biz.\n\nLet's assign the smallest available prime numbers to each domain:\n\n- .org = 2\n- .net = 3\n- .info = 5\n- .biz = 7\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost of these domains:\n\nCost of .org = 2\nCost of .net = 3\nCost of .info = 5\nCost of .biz = 7\n\nTotal cost = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the remaining 4 domains is 17."
