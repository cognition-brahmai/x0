        "content": "I'm running a Random Forest algorithm with around 130k features, 500 of which are non-TF-IDF features. I noticed that the accuracy of the Random Forest on the same test set with only the non-TF-IDF features is 87%, but when I include the TF-IDF features, it drops to 76%. I've included my code for reference. I'm not sure why the accuracy decreases so significantly when I include the TF-IDF features. I've hypothesized that the non-TF-IDF features aren't being picked up as much by the trees of the Random Forest, and when I checked the features' importances, the importances of the non-TF-IDF features were very low. Could you explain why this decrease in accuracy might be occurring and offer any suggestions on what to do next? One idea I had was to have two separate models for the TF-IDF and non-TF-IDF features and combine the results."

        "content": "The decrease in accuracy when including TF-IDF features could be due to several factors. Here are some possible reasons and suggestions for addressing the issue:\n\n1. **Curse of Dimensionality**: With 130k TF-IDF features, the model might be overwhelmed by the high dimensionality, making it difficult to find meaningful patterns. This could lead to overfitting on noise rather than learning the true underlying relationships.\n\n2. **Irrelevant or Noisy Features**: Many TF-IDF features might be irrelevant or noisy, diluting the impact of the more informative non-TF-IDF features. This can reduce the model's ability to generalize well.\n\n3. **Feature Importance**: If the non-TF-IDF features have low importance, it suggests that their signal might be getting overshadowed by the TF-IDF features. This can cause the model to focus on the less relevant TF-IDF features.\n\n### Suggestions:\n\n1. **Feature Selection**: Reduce the number of TF-IDF features by using feature selection techniques. Methods like Chi-Square, Mutual Information, or using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA or Truncated SVD can help identify the most relevant features.\n\n2. **Regularization**: Consider applying regularization to the Random Forest model to prevent overfitting. Techniques like setting a maximum depth for trees or using a minimum number of samples per leaf can help.\n\n3. **Separate Models**: Your idea of using separate models for TF-IDF and non-TF-IDF features and combining their results is a good one. You can use ensemble techniques like stacking or voting to combine the predictions from both models.\n\n4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Ensure that the hyperparameters of the Random Forest model are well-tuned, as the default settings might not be optimal for your dataset's specific characteristics.\n\n5. **Feature Engineering**: Explore additional feature engineering methods to enhance the value of the non-TF-IDF features, potentially increasing their importance in the model.\n\n6. **Cross-Validation**: Use cross-validation to ensure that the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the data, helping to confirm that the observed accuracy drop is not due to random variations.\n\nBy experimenting with these approaches, you should be able to identify why the TF-IDF features are negatively impacting the model's performance and find a solution that leverages both sets of features effectively."
