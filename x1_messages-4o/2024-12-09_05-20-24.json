For example, I have the following code:\n\n```python\ndef func1():return 1\ndef func2():return 2\ndef func3():return 3\n\nfl = [func1,func2,func3]\n\nfl[0]()\nfl[1]()\nfl[2]()\n```\n\nI know that I can call these functions using a loop like this:\n\n```python\nfor f in fl:\n   f()\n```\n\nBut can I achieve the same result using list comprehension like this?\n\n```python\n[f() for f in fl]\n```\n\nAdditionally, if my list of functions is in a class like this:\n\n```python\nclass F:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.a, self.b, self.c = 0,0,0\n\n    def func1(self):\n        self.a += 1\n\n    def func2(self):\n        self.b += 1\n\n    def func3(self):\n        self.c += 1\n\n    fl = [func1,func2,func3]\n\nfobj= F()\n\nfor f in fobj.fl:\n    f()\n```\n\nWill this work?"

        "content": "Yes, you can definitely call a list of functions using list comprehension in Python. In your initial example, using list comprehension to call the functions would look like this:\n\n```python\n[f() for f in fl]\n```\n\nThis line will execute each function in the list `fl` and create a list with the results of those function calls. Although the results are being stored in a new list, if you're not using the results, you don't necessarily need to store them.\n\nRegarding your class example, there is a slight issue. The functions in the list `fl` are defined as instance methods, but they are being called without an instance of the class. This won't work as intended because instance methods require an instance to be called properly. You need to call these methods on an instance of the class `F`.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to make it work:\n\n```python\nclass F:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.a, self.b, self.c = 0, 0, 0\n\n    def func1(self):\n        self.a += 1\n\n    def func2(self):\n        self.b += 1\n\n    def func3(self):\n        self.c += 1\n\n    # Define fl as a property of the class to access instance methods\n    @property\n    def fl(self):\n        return [self.func1, self.func2, self.func3]\n\nfobj = F()\n\n[f() for f in fobj.fl]\n\nprint(fobj.a, fobj.b, fobj.c)  # Outputs: 1 1 1\n```\n\nBy using a property, `fl` returns a list of bound methods that can be called on the instance `fobj`. This ensures that each method modifies the instance's state correctly."
