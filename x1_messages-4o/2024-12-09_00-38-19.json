I am trying to calculate the sum of the first items of each pair, i.e., 0 + 2 + 5 + 2. My current approach is to iterate through the list using this code:\n\n```python\nsum = 0\nfor pair in list_of_pairs:\n   sum += pair[0]\n```\nHowever, I am looking for a more Pythonic method to achieve this."

        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this in a more Pythonic way by using the `sum()` function combined with a generator expression. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nlist_of_pairs = [(0, 1), (2, 3), (5, 7), (2, 1)]\ntotal_sum = sum(pair[0] for pair in list_of_pairs)\n```\n\nThis approach uses a generator expression `pair[0] for pair in list_of_pairs` to iterate over the list and extract the first element of each tuple, and then `sum()` to calculate the total sum of these elements. This is more concise and considered more Pythonic."
