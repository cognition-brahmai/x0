For reference, here is my current method:\n\n```python\nS = [1,30,20,30,2] # My list\nfor s, i in zip(S, range(len(S))):\n    # Do stuff with the content s and the index i\n```\nI am finding the syntax, especially the part inside the `zip` function, a bit cumbersome and am looking for a cleaner approach."

        "content": "In Python, you can achieve this in a more Pythonic and elegant way using the `enumerate` function. The `enumerate` function adds a counter to an iterable and returns it in the form of an enumerating object. This can be directly used in a loop to get both the index and the value of each element in the list. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nS = [1, 30, 20, 30, 2]  # Your list\nfor i, s in enumerate(S):\n    # Do stuff with the index i and the content s\n```\n\nIn this code, `enumerate(S)` returns pairs of `(index, value)`, which you can unpack directly in the loop with `i` being the index and `s` being the value. This is generally considered more readable and idiomatic in Python compared to manually using `zip` with `range`."
