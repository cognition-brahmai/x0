        "content": "How can I properly handle duplicate primary keys on insert in SQLAlchemy (declarative style)? I am using a scoped session for my web-app where a lot of the DB insertions are executed by Celery, a task scheduler. However, due to multiple asynchronous workers, there are instances where one worker might be halfway through inserting a Bike with id=123, while another one is checking for its existence. This results in an IntegrityError being raised by SQLAlchemy when the second worker tries to insert a row with the same primary key. Currently, I am managing this by replacing Session.commit() with a function that handles IntegrityError. However, this approach seems brittle because of the string checking. Is there a more robust approach that maintains the clean SQLAlchemy style I am using?"

        "content": "Handling duplicate primary keys in SQLAlchemy, especially in a concurrent environment like one with Celery workers, requires careful management to avoid integrity errors. Here are some strategies you can consider to handle this situation more robustly:\n\n1. **Use `merge` Instead of `add`:**\n   The `merge()` function in SQLAlchemy can help in scenarios where you want to avoid duplicates. It checks if the object is already present in the database; if it is, it updates the existing object with the state of the given instance. If it's not present, it performs an insert.\n\n   ```python\n   from sqlalchemy.exc import IntegrityError\n\n   def add_or_update_bike(session, bike):\n       try:\n           session.merge(bike)\n           session.commit()\n       except IntegrityError:\n           session.rollback()\n           # Handle the integrity error as needed\n\n   # Usage\n   add_or_update_bike(session, bike_instance)\n   ```\n\n2. **Use `ON CONFLICT` / `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`:**\n   If you're using PostgreSQL, you can take advantage of the `ON CONFLICT` clause to handle duplicates at the database level. For MySQL, you can use `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`.\n\n   ```python\n   from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import insert\n\n   def upsert_bike(session, bike):\n       stmt = insert(Bike).values(\n           id=bike.id,\n           # other fields\n       ).on_conflict_do_update(\n           index_elements=['id'],\n           set_=dict(\n               # fields to update\n           )\n       )\n       session.execute(stmt)\n       session.commit()\n\n   # Usage\n   upsert_bike(session, bike_instance)\n   ```\n\n3. **Check-and-Insert Pattern:**\n   You can implement a check-and-insert pattern where you first query the database to see if the row exists, and only insert if it doesn't. This approach might still face race conditions, but locking mechanisms can mitigate the issue.\n\n   ```python\n   from sqlalchemy.exc import IntegrityError\n\n   def add_bike_if_not_exists(session, bike):\n       existing_bike = session.query(Bike).filter_by(id=bike.id).first()\n       if not existing_bike:\n           try:\n               session.add(bike)\n               session.commit()\n           except IntegrityError:\n               session.rollback()\n               # Handle the integrity error as needed\n\n   # Usage\n   add_bike_if_not_exists(session, bike_instance)\n   ```\n\n4. **Database Locking:**\n   For more robust handling, you might consider using database-level locking mechanisms to serialize access to critical sections of your code. This can be done using advisory locks in PostgreSQL or similar features in other databases.\n\n5. **Task Coordination:**\n   To avoid concurrent modifications, you can use a distributed lock mechanism like Redis locks to ensure that only one worker can perform the insert for a particular bike at any given time.\n\nThese strategies help maintain the integrity of your database while still leveraging SQLAlchemy's capabilities. Choose the one that best fits your application's concurrency requirements and database capabilities."
