        "content": "To determine the percentage of the total area covered by a sector of a circle with a central angle of 60\u00b0, we can use the concept of proportionality in a circle. Here's a step-by-step breakdown using a formula:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Total Circle\n\n- A full circle has a total of 360\u00b0.\n- The area of a full circle is given by the formula \\( A = \\pi r^2 \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius of the circle.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Sector of the Circle\n\n- A sector of a circle with a central angle of 60\u00b0 is a portion of the circle.\n- The area of a sector can be found by using the formula for the area of a full circle and then taking the fraction of the circle corresponding to the central angle.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Fraction of the Circle\n\n- The fraction of the circle that the sector represents is given by the ratio of the central angle to the total angle in the circle:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Fraction of the circle} = \\frac{\\text{Central Angle}}{\\text{Total Angle in Circle}} = \\frac{60\u00b0}{360\u00b0} = \\frac{1}{6}\n  \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Area of the Sector\n\n- The area of the sector is the fraction of the circle's area:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Area of the sector} = \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\pi r^2\n  \\]\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Percentage of the Total Area\n\n- To find the percentage of the total area that the sector covers, multiply the fraction by 100:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Percentage of the total area} = \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) \\times 100\\% = 16.67\\%\n  \\]\n\nThus, the sector of the circle with a central angle of 60\u00b0 covers 16.67% of the total area of the circle."
