For instance, if I have a list defined as follows: \n\n```python\nL = range(0,101,10)\n```\n\nwhich outputs \n\n```python\n[0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]\n```\n\nI want to be able to assign the values at indices 2 and 5 to variables `a` and `b` respectively, such that `a == 20` and `b == 50`. I'm aware of the method like `a,b = L[2:6:3][:2]` but it doesn't scale well to irregular intervals. I wonder if using list comprehension with the indices I want, such as `[L[x] for x in [2,5]]`, is a recommended solution for this common problem?"

        "content": "In Python, if you need to access arbitrary, non-sequential elements from a list, using a list comprehension with the specific indices you want is indeed a recommended and efficient approach. Your example, `[L[x] for x in [2, 5]]`, is clear and concise for this purpose. This method allows you to pick any elements from the list without being constrained by the regularity of slicing. \n\nHere's how you can use it in your case:\n\n```python\nL = list(range(0, 101, 10))\n\n# Indices of elements you want to extract\nindices = [2, 5]\n\n# Extracting the elements using list comprehension\nselected_values = [L[i] for i in indices]\n\n# Assigning the values to variables\na, b = selected_values\n\nprint(a)  # Output: 20\nprint(b)  # Output: 50\n```\n\nThis method is efficient for accessing specific elements because it operates in O(k) time complexity, where k is the number of indices you're accessing. It is also flexible, allowing you to easily change the indices list to access different elements."
