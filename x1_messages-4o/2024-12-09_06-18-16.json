I have downloaded and installed `Python 2.7` from the official website and ran the command `mkvirtualenv --python=python2.7 mynewenv` to set up the new virtual environment. I have also set up my `.bash_profile` accordingly. However, when I open the console, I receive an error stating `ImportError: No module named virtualenvwrapper.hook_loader`. I tried upgrading `virtualenvwrapper` as suggested in a different post, but the problem persists. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests there might be an issue with the installation or configuration of `virtualenvwrapper`. Here are some steps you can try to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Dependencies**: First, make sure you have installed both `virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper` for Python 2.7. You can do this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip2.7 install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper\n   ```\n\n2. **Check `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc`**: Make sure your configuration file (either `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc`, depending on which one you are using) is set up correctly to include the paths for `virtualenvwrapper`. Add or verify the following lines:\n\n   ```bash\n   export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs\n   export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/local/bin/python2.7\n   source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh\n   ```\n\n   Ensure that the path to Python 2.7 (`/usr/local/bin/python2.7`) and `virtualenvwrapper.sh` are correct. You can find the correct path to Python 2.7 by running `which python2.7`.\n\n3. **Reload Your Shell Configuration**: After making changes to your shell configuration file, reload it:\n\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bash_profile\n   ```\n\n   or\n\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bashrc\n   ```\n\n4. **Install `virtualenvwrapper` for Python 2.7**: It\u2019s possible that `virtualenvwrapper` is not installed for the Python version you are using. You can install it specifically for Python 2.7:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip2.7 install --upgrade virtualenvwrapper\n   ```\n\n5. **Check Python Path**: Make sure that your Python 2.7 installation is accessible and is the default version being used when you call `python2.7`. You can verify this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   python2.7 --version\n   ```\n\n   If it's not returning Python 2.7, you may need to adjust your PATH or use an alias.\n\n6. **Recreate the Virtual Environment**: Sometimes recreating the virtual environment can solve issues:\n\n   ```bash\n   rmvirtualenv mynewenv\n   mkvirtualenv --python=python2.7 mynewenv\n   ```\n\nIf you continue to experience issues, consider checking for any specific error messages that could provide more insight into what might be going wrong."
