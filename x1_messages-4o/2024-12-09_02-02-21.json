        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering seems to be related to the `icu-config` tool not being available on your system. This tool is part of the ICU (International Components for Unicode) library, which PyICU depends on. Here are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Install ICU Library:**\n   - You need to install the ICU library on your system. Since you are using a Mac, you can use Homebrew to do this:\n     ```bash\n     brew install icu4c\n     ```\n\n2. **Set Environment Variables:**\n   - After installing ICU, you might need to set some environment variables so that the PyICU installation can find the necessary headers and libraries. You can add these to your shell profile (`~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):\n     ```bash\n     export PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/icu4c/bin:$PATH\"\n     export PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/icu4c/sbin:$PATH\"\n     export LDFLAGS=\"-L/usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib\"\n     export CPPFLAGS=\"-I/usr/local/opt/icu4c/include\"\n     ```\n   - Apply the changes by running:\n     ```bash\n     source ~/.bash_profile\n     # or\n     source ~/.zshrc\n     ```\n\n3. **Install PyICU:**\n   - Now, try installing PyICU again using pip:\n     ```bash\n     pip install pyicu\n     ```\n\n4. **Consider Python Environment:**\n   - Ensure you are using the correct Python version and environment. Consider using a virtual environment to avoid version conflicts:\n     ```bash\n     python3 -m venv myenv\n     source myenv/bin/activate\n     pip install pyicu\n     ```\n\n5. **Check Python Version:**\n   - Ensure you're using a supported version of Python for PyICU. If you're using Python 2.7, consider upgrading to Python 3.x, as Python 2 has reached its end-of-life.\n\nAfter following these steps, you should be able to successfully install PyICU on your Mac. If you encounter further issues, please provide any additional error messages for further assistance."
