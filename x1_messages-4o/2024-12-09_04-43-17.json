I am aware of several methods to generate documentation, including converting to C++-like files, using Python's sphinxcontrib-matlabdomain, using m2html, and other options mentioned in various Q&A's. However, these are not supported by Mathworks and they require me to manually mention the parameters of a function. They do not analyze the code in the way that Doxygen does for Java. I am aware of Matlab's publish() function but have not seen it used in this context. Is there a Mathworks-approved way to generate Matlab HTML documentation that allows the code to be analyzed and uses the information provided to the Matlab Input Parser? I would appreciate any insights or personal recommendations.\n\nExample:\n\n```matlab\n%% Input parser\np = inputParser;\naddRequired(p, 'x', @isnumeric);\n\nvalidationFcn = @(x) (isnumeric(x) && isscalar(x));\naddRequired(p, 'fftSize', validationFcn);\naddRequired(p, 'fftShift', validationFcn);\n\nvalidationFcn = @(x) (isa(x, 'function_handle'));\naddRequired(p, 'analysisWindowHandle', validationFcn);\n\nparse(p, x, fftSize, fftShift, analysisWindowHandle);\n```"

        "content": "Generating documentation for MATLAB code that is both comprehensive and easily shareable can indeed be a challenge, especially when you want to leverage the power of tools like input parsers and maintain a structured format similar to Doxygen for other languages. While the options you've explored offer various features, here are some insights and recommendations that might help you achieve your goal using MathWorks-supported tools:\n\n1. **MATLAB's Built-in Documentation Tools:**\n   MATLAB provides several built-in tools for generating documentation, but they often require some manual effort to ensure completeness and accuracy. One option is to use MATLAB's live scripts and functions to create structured documentation. You can use the \"publish()\" function to convert MATLAB scripts and functions into HTML documents, but it primarily focuses on displaying the code along with comments rather than analyzing parameters.\n\n2. **Custom Documentation Generation:**\n   While MATLAB doesn\u2019t have a direct equivalent to Doxygen for analyzing input parsers automatically, you can create custom scripts to parse your own code and generate documentation. Here\u2019s a high-level approach you can take:\n   \n   - Write a custom MATLAB script that reads your function files.\n   - Use regular expressions or MATLAB parsing functions to extract function signatures and input parser details.\n   - Generate HTML documentation based on the extracted information, possibly using MATLAB's DOM (Document Object Model) API to format the output.\n\n3. **MATLAB Input Parser and Comments:**\n   While MATLAB doesn\u2019t automatically generate documentation from input parsers, you can enhance the readability and usefulness of your documentation by:\n   \n   - Using structured comments (e.g., `%`) above your functions and within your code to describe the purpose of each input parameter.\n   - Including examples and usage notes within these comments to guide users.\n\n4. **MATLAB Report Generator:**\n   If you have access to the MATLAB Report Generator, you can create more elaborate documentation with customized templates and formatting options. This tool allows you to automate the generation of reports that include code, output, and formatted text.\n\n5. **Third-party Tools and Community Solutions:**\n   While you mentioned a preference for MathWorks-supported tools, you might still consider third-party tools or community solutions that integrate well with MATLAB. For example, some users have created their own MATLAB scripts that mimic the behavior of Doxygen by parsing comments and code structure.\n\nUltimately, the best approach depends on your specific needs, such as the level of automation you require and the complexity of your codebase. If you're willing to invest some time in developing a custom solution, you can tailor it to fit your exact requirements and potentially share it with the MATLAB community for others facing similar challenges."
