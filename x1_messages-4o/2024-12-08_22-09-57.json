        "content": "Certainly! You can make the PHP code more dynamic by incorporating random or interesting facts from an array. Here's an example of how you might structure your code to add two dynamic and interesting facts to your sentence:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Array containing interesting ocean facts\n$oceanFacts = [\n    \"The Pacific Ocean is the largest ocean in the world.\",\n    \"The Atlantic Ocean is saltier than the Pacific Ocean.\",\n    \"The Mariana Trench is the deepest point in the world's oceans.\",\n    \"Oceans contain 97% of the Earth's water.\",\n    \"The Great Barrier Reef is the largest living structure on Earth.\",\n    \"There are more historic artifacts under the sea than in all of the world\u2019s museums.\",\n    \"The ocean is home to nearly 95% of all life on Earth.\",\n    \"The Indian Ocean is the warmest ocean in the world.\"\n];\n\n// Select two random facts from the array\n$fact1 = $oceanFacts[array_rand($oceanFacts)];\n$fact2 = $oceanFacts[array_rand($oceanFacts)];\n\n// Ensure fact1 and fact2 are not the same\nwhile ($fact1 === $fact2) {\n    $fact2 = $oceanFacts[array_rand($oceanFacts)];\n}\n\n// Construct and echo the sentence\necho \"Did you know that oceans cover 70% of the Earth's surface? \" . $fact1 . \" \" . $fact2;\n?>\n```\n\nThis code creates an array of interesting ocean facts and randomly selects two different facts to insert into the sentence. The `array_rand` function is used to pick random facts from the array, and a `while` loop ensures that the two facts are not the same. This makes the output dynamic and varied each time the script runs."
