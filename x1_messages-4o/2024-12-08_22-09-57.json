Ask them to tell you about a personal interest they've been actively engaged in for the past few years. Encourage them to describe the activities they've been doing and their level of dedication. Listen for clues that suggest they've been pursuing the hobby for an extended period of time without explicitly stating the hobby itself. Bonus points if you can infer their use of the present perfect continuous tense in describing their activities."

        "content": "Certainly! Here's how you might structure the question to indirectly gauge their passion and dedication:\n\n---\n\n\"Could you share with me a personal interest or activity that you've been deeply involved with over the past few years? I'm curious to hear about what you've been doing, how you've been engaging with it, and any experiences or milestones that stand out to you. Feel free to describe the journey you've been on with this interest.\"\n\n---\n\nAs the candidate responds, listen for clues such as:\n\n- Descriptions of activities they have been participating in regularly.\n- Any mention of goals or achievements related to the interest.\n- References to the amount of time or effort they have dedicated to the interest.\n- Use of phrases in the present perfect continuous tense, such as \"I have been working on,\" \"I have been exploring,\" or \"I have been dedicating time to.\"\n\nThese language patterns can provide insights into their ongoing commitment and enthusiasm for the hobby."
