        "content": "Creating a list of woodworking tools with their specific purposes, taking into account weight and dimension limitations, and identifying multifunctional tools can be approached systematically in R. To achieve this, you can create a structured data frame containing the relevant information about each tool. Here's a sample R code to get you started:\n\n```r\n# Load necessary library\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Create a data frame of woodworking tools\nwoodworking_tools <- data.frame(\n  Tool = c(\"Hand Saw\", \"Chisel\", \"Hammer\", \"Screwdriver\", \"Circular Saw\", \"Drill\", \"Multitool\"),\n  Purpose = c(\n    \"Cutting wood manually\",\n    \"Carving and chiseling wood\",\n    \"Driving nails into wood\",\n    \"Driving screws into wood\",\n    \"Cutting wood with power\",\n    \"Drilling holes and driving screws\",\n    \"Performing multiple tasks like cutting, sanding, scraping\"\n  ),\n  Type = c(\"Hand\", \"Hand\", \"Hand\", \"Hand\", \"Power\", \"Power\", \"Power\"),\n  Weight_kg = c(0.5, 0.3, 1.0, 0.2, 4.0, 2.0, 1.5),\n  Dimensions_cm = c(\"50x15\", \"25x5\", \"30x10\", \"20x5\", \"30x25\", \"25x10\", \"20x10\"),\n  Multifunctional = c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)\n)\n\n# Display tools that are multifunctional\nmultifunctional_tools <- woodworking_tools %>%\n  filter(Multifunctional == TRUE)\n\n# Print the entire list of tools\nprint(\"List of woodworking tools with their purposes, weight, and dimensions:\")\nprint(woodworking_tools)\n\n# Print multifunctional tools\nprint(\"Multifunctional tools:\")\nprint(multifunctional_tools)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The code creates a data frame `woodworking_tools` with columns for the tool name, purpose, type (hand or power), weight, dimensions, and whether it is multifunctional.\n- It uses the `dplyr` package to filter and display multifunctional tools.\n- The code identifies the \"Multitool\" as a tool that can perform multiple functions.\n\nYou can expand this data frame with more tools, dimensions, and weights as needed. Adjust the weight and dimension constraints according to your specific requirements."
