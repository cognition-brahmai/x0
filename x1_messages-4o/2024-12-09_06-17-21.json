For instance, when I execute the following code:\n\n```python\ncursor = connection.cursor() #Cursor could be a normal cursor or dict cursor\nquery = \"Select id from bs\"\ncursor.execute(query)\nrow = cursor.fetchall()\n```\nThe resultant row is either `((123,),(234,))` or `({'id':123}, {'id':234})`. I need it to be `(123,234)` or `[123,234]`. Is there a way to avoid parsing the resultset?"

        "content": "To retrieve the results of a `fetchall` operation as a list of values, you can indeed achieve this by iterating over the fetched rows and extracting the desired field. Here's how you can do it for both cases: when you have a normal cursor and a dictionary cursor.\n\n1. **Using a Normal Cursor:**\n\n   If your cursor returns tuples (e.g., `((123,), (234,))`), you can use a list comprehension to extract the first element from each tuple:\n\n   ```python\n   cursor = connection.cursor()\n   query = \"SELECT id FROM bs\"\n   cursor.execute(query)\n   rows = cursor.fetchall()\n   result = [row[0] for row in rows]\n   print(result)  # Outputs: [123, 234]\n   ```\n\n2. **Using a Dictionary Cursor:**\n\n   If your cursor returns dictionaries (e.g., `({'id': 123}, {'id': 234})`), you can similarly use a list comprehension to extract the value associated with the key `id`:\n\n   ```python\n   cursor = connection.cursor(dictionary=True)  # Ensure dictionary cursor\n   query = \"SELECT id FROM bs\"\n   cursor.execute(query)\n   rows = cursor.fetchall()\n   result = [row['id'] for row in rows]\n   print(result)  # Outputs: [123, 234]\n   ```\n\nIn both cases, the list comprehension efficiently constructs a list of the desired values from the fetched results. This method is simple and avoids the need to manually parse the result set."
