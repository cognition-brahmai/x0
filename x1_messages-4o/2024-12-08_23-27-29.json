Additionally, the program should also output the number of words and characters in the sentence. For example, for the sentence \"Close the door quietly, or you'll wake the baby!\", the program should identify it as an imperative sentence and output \"10 words and 40 characters\". Can you provide the updated code for this program?"

Below is a Java program that identifies the type of a given sentence (declarative, interrogative, imperative, or exclamatory) and also counts the number of words and characters in the sentence.\n\n```java\npublic class SentenceAnalyzer {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String sentence = \"Close the door quietly, or you'll wake the baby!\";\n        analyzeSentence(sentence);\n    }\n\n    public static void analyzeSentence(String sentence) {\n        String trimmedSentence = sentence.trim();\n        \n        // Determine the type of sentence\n        String sentenceType = identifySentenceType(trimmedSentence);\n        \n        // Count words and characters\n        int wordCount = countWords(trimmedSentence);\n        int characterCount = countCharacters(trimmedSentence);\n        \n        // Output the results\n        System.out.println(\"Sentence Type: \" + sentenceType);\n        System.out.println(wordCount + \" words and \" + characterCount + \" characters\");\n    }\n\n    private static String identifySentenceType(String sentence) {\n        if (sentence.endsWith(\"?\")) {\n            return \"Interrogative\";\n        } else if (sentence.endsWith(\"!\")) {\n            return \"Exclamatory\";\n        } else if (sentence.matches(\"^(Please|Can|Could|Will|Would|Shall|Should|Must|May|Might|Do|Does|Did|Let's).*\")) {\n            return \"Imperative\";\n        } else {\n            return \"Declarative\";\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static int countWords(String sentence) {\n        if (sentence.isEmpty()) {\n            return 0;\n        }\n        String[] words = sentence.split(\"\\\\s+\");\n        return words.length;\n    }\n\n    private static int countCharacters(String sentence) {\n        return sentence.replaceAll(\"\\\\s\", \"\").length();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **identifySentenceType**: This method determines the sentence type based on the punctuation at the end of the sentence or specific starting words associated with imperative sentences.\n\n2. **countWords**: This method counts the number of words in the sentence by splitting the sentence on spaces.\n\n3. **countCharacters**: This method counts the number of characters by removing all whitespace from the sentence.\n\n### Usage:\n- You can modify the `sentence` variable in the `main` method to test different sentences. The program will identify the type of the sentence and output the word and character count accordingly."
