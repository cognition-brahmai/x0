Below is a simple C# program that finds the longest word in a given sentence:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Enter a sentence:\");\n        string sentence = Console.ReadLine();\n        \n        string longestWord = FindLongestWord(sentence);\n        \n        Console.WriteLine(\"The longest word is: \" + longestWord);\n    }\n    \n    static string FindLongestWord(string sentence)\n    {\n        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(sentence))\n        {\n            return string.Empty;\n        }\n\n        string[] words = sentence.Split(new char[] {' ', '\\t', '\\n', '\\r'}, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries);\n        string longestWord = string.Empty;\n\n        foreach (string word in words)\n        {\n            if (word.Length > longestWord.Length)\n            {\n                longestWord = word;\n            }\n        }\n\n        return longestWord;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### How it works:\n- The program reads a sentence from the user.\n- It splits the sentence into words using spaces and other common whitespace characters as delimiters.\n- It iterates through the array of words to find the longest word.\n- If a longer word is found, it updates the `longestWord` variable.\n- Finally, it prints the longest word.\n\nYou can run this program in any C# environment or IDE like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code."
