However, when I run my script that includes importing pandas and matplotlib and reading an Excel file using pandas' pd.ExcelFile() function, I encounter an ImportError stating \"No module named 'xlrd'\".

Here is my script and the error I receive:\n\nScript:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\ndata = pd.ExcelFile(\"Obes-phys-acti-diet-eng-2014-tab.xls\")\nprint (data.sheet_names)\n```\n\nError:\n```python\ndhcp-169-233-172-97:Obesity juliushamilton$ python3 ob.py\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"ob.py\", line 4, in &lt;module&gt;\n    data = pd.ExcelFile(\"Obes-phys-acti-diet-eng-2014-tab.xls\")\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/lib/python3.4/site-packages/pandas/io/excel.py\", line 169, in __init__\n    import xlrd  # throw an ImportError if we need to\nImportError: No module named 'xlrd'\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the absence of the `xlrd` module, which is required by pandas to read Excel files in the `.xls` format. When you use `pd.ExcelFile()`, pandas relies on `xlrd` to handle `.xls` files.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to install the `xlrd` package. You can do this using pip. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:\n\n```bash\npip3 install xlrd\n```\n\nAfter installing `xlrd`, try running your script again. It should work without raising the ImportError.\n\nAdditionally, if you are working with `.xlsx` files in the future, you might want to consider using `openpyxl` or `pandas`' built-in `read_excel` function, which supports `.xlsx` files directly. You can install `openpyxl` with:\n\n```bash\npip3 install openpyxl\n```\n\nFor `.xls` files, `xlrd` is still the way to go. If you run into any further issues, make sure your Python environment and all packages are up-to-date."
