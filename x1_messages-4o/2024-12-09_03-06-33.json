I have a dataset represented as a NumPy matrix of shape `(num_features, num_examples)` that I want to convert into a TensorFlow type `tf.Dataset`. Could you explain the differences between these two methods and guide me on which one to use? According to TensorFlow documentation, both methods accept a nested structure of tensor. However, it is mentioned that when using `from_tensor_slices`, the tensor should have the same size in the 0-th dimension."

        "content": "In TensorFlow, both `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensors` and `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices` are used to create datasets from tensors, but they serve different purposes and handle the input data differently.\n\n### `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensors`\n\n- **Purpose:** This method is used to create a dataset with a single element. The entire tensor you provide is treated as one single element in the dataset.\n- **Usage:** When you want each call to `next()` on the dataset to return the entire tensor as a single batch, you would use `from_tensors`.\n- **Example:** If you have a tensor `X` of shape `(num_features, num_examples)`, using `from_tensors(X)` will create a dataset with a single element, where that element is the entire tensor `X`.\n\n### `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices`\n\n- **Purpose:** This method is used to slice the input tensor along its first dimension, creating a dataset where each element is one slice (i.e., one row or one sample) of the original tensor.\n- **Usage:** When you want to iterate over individual samples or slices of your tensor, you would use `from_tensor_slices`. Each element in the dataset corresponds to a slice of the tensor along the first dimension.\n- **Example:** If you have a tensor `X` of shape `(num_features, num_examples)`, using `from_tensor_slices(X)` will create a dataset with `num_features` elements, each of shape `(num_examples,)`.\n\n### Which One to Use?\n\nGiven your dataset is a NumPy matrix of shape `(num_features, num_examples)`, you need to decide how you want to iterate over the data:\n\n- **Use `from_tensors`:** If you want to treat the entire dataset as a single item (batch), and each iteration should yield the complete dataset, go with `from_tensors`.\n  \n- **Use `from_tensor_slices`:** If you want to iterate over individual features (assuming `num_features` represents different samples or data points), use `from_tensor_slices`. In this scenario, each iteration will return a single feature vector of shape `(num_examples,)`.\n\n### Example Code\n\nHere's a quick example to illustrate both:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Example NumPy matrix\nX = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])\n\n# Using from_tensors\ndataset_from_tensors = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensors(X)\nfor element in dataset_from_tensors:\n    print(\"from_tensors:\", element.numpy())\n\n# Using from_tensor_slices\ndataset_from_tensor_slices = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(X)\nfor element in dataset_from_tensor_slices:\n    print(\"from_tensor_slices:\", element.numpy())\n```\n\nIn this example, `dataset_from_tensors` will have one element (the entire matrix `X`), while `dataset_from_tensor_slices` will have three elements, each a row from `X`. Choose the method that aligns with how you want to process your data in your application."
