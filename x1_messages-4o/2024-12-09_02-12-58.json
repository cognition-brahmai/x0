I've been trying to implement this with parentheses, as seen in the following code:\n\n```\n{% if user.is_admin or something.enable_thing and user.can_do_the_thing %}\n```\nI attempted to use parentheses to make this clearer:\n```\n{% if user.is_admin or (something.enable_thing and user.can_do_the_thing) %}\n```\nHowever, parentheses are not allowed. The Django documentation suggests using nested if or elif statements, but I would prefer not to repeat the same HTML inside two different if blocks. Is there a cleaner solution?"

        "content": "In Django templates, you can't use parentheses to group conditions within an `if` statement, which can indeed make complex logical expressions a bit tricky to handle. However, you can achieve the desired logic by using a combination of `if` and `elif` or by creating a custom template filter that handles the logic for you. \n\nHere's a cleaner solution using a custom template filter:\n\n1. **Create a custom template filter:**\n\n   First, you need to create a custom template filter to handle the logic `(B and C)`. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n   - Create a file named `custom_filters.py` in one of your app directories, or use an existing `templatetags` directory:\n\n     ```python\n     from django import template\n\n     register = template.Library()\n\n     @register.filter\n     def and_condition(value, arg):\n         return value and arg\n     ```\n\n   - Ensure there is an `__init__.py` file in the `templatetags` directory to make it a package.\n\n2. **Load and use the custom filter in your template:**\n\n   Now, load your custom filter in the template and use it in your `if` statement:\n\n   ```html\n   {% load custom_filters %}\n\n   {% if user.is_admin or (something.enable_thing|and_condition:user.can_do_the_thing) %}\n       <!-- Your HTML here -->\n   {% endif %}\n   ```\n\nThis approach keeps your logic clean without repeating HTML in multiple `if` blocks. The custom filter `and_condition` evaluates the `B and C` part of your logic, and you can continue to use the `or` in your template.\n\nIf you prefer not to use custom filters, you could use a Python function in your view to pre-calculate the condition and pass it to the template context:\n\n```python\n# In your view\ncontext = {\n    'condition': user.is_admin or (something.enable_thing and user.can_do_the_thing),\n    # other context variables\n}\n\n# In your template\n{% if condition %}\n    <!-- Your HTML here -->\n{% endif %}\n```\n\nThis way, you handle the logic in your view, simplifying the template logic."
