Here is my code:\n\n```python\nfrom Tkinter import *\n\nadmin = Tk()\ndef button(an):\n    print(an)\n    print('het')\n\nb = Button(admin, text='as', command=button('hey'))\nb.pack()\nmainloop()\n```\n\nThe button seems to not work properly. It prints 'hey' and 'het' once without my input, and then, when I press the button nothing happens. Why is this happening and how can I fix it?"

        "content": "The issue you are facing is because you are calling the `button` function immediately when you pass it as the `command` argument to the `Button`. In Python, when you use parentheses after a function name, you are calling the function, not just referencing it.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can use a lambda function or the `functools.partial` to delay the execution of the function until the button is clicked. Here's how you can do it with a lambda function:\n\n```python\nfrom Tkinter import *\n\nadmin = Tk()\n\ndef button(an):\n    print(an)\n    print('het')\n\n# Use a lambda function to delay the execution of the `button` function\nb = Button(admin, text='as', command=lambda: button('hey'))\nb.pack()\n\nmainloop()\n```\n\nWith this change, the `button` function will only be executed when you actually click the button. The lambda function acts as a wrapper that calls the `button` function with the argument `'hey'` when the button is clicked."
