Your design must include the following properties:\n- The engine displacement should be greater than 2 liters.\n- The fuel type should be a combination of at least two types (e.g. gasoline and electricity).\n- The number of wheels should be odd and between 3 and 7.\n- The transmission type should be a manual with at least 6 gears.\nCan you provide a blueprint for the vehicle class that meets these requirements? Remember, each property must be carefully chosen and thought out to create the ultimate driving machine!"

The class will include properties for engine displacement, fuel type, number of wheels, and transmission type, among others.\n\n```python\nclass UltimateDrivingMachine:\n    def __init__(self, engine_displacement, fuel_types, number_of_wheels, transmission_type, gear_count):\n        self.engine_displacement = engine_displacement  # in liters\n        self.fuel_types = fuel_types  # list of fuel types\n        self.number_of_wheels = number_of_wheels\n        self.transmission_type = transmission_type\n        self.gear_count = gear_count\n\n    def display_vehicle_info(self):\n        print(f\"Engine Displacement: {self.engine_displacement} liters\")\n        print(f\"Fuel Types: {', '.join(self.fuel_types)}\")\n        print(f\"Number of Wheels: {self.number_of_wheels}\")\n        print(f\"Transmission Type: {self.transmission_type}\")\n        print(f\"Number of Gears: {self.gear_count}\")\n\n# Create an instance of UltimateDrivingMachine with the specified properties\nvehicle = UltimateDrivingMachine(\n    engine_displacement=2.5,  # Greater than 2 liters\n    fuel_types=['Gasoline', 'Electricity'],  # Combination of two types\n    number_of_wheels=3,  # Odd and between 3 and 7\n    transmission_type='Manual',  # Manual transmission\n    gear_count=6  # At least 6 gears\n)\n\n# Display the vehicle information\nvehicle.display_vehicle_info()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Engine Displacement**: We set the engine displacement to 2.5 liters, which is greater than 2 liters.\n- **Fuel Types**: The vehicle uses a combination of gasoline and electricity, making it a hybrid.\n- **Number of Wheels**: The vehicle has 3 wheels, which is an odd number and within the specified range.\n- **Transmission Type**: The vehicle is equipped with a manual transmission.\n- **Gear Count**: The vehicle has a manual transmission with 6 gears.\n\nThis blueprint provides a flexible foundation for creating an ultimate driving machine that meets all the specified requirements. Feel free to expand or modify the class to include additional features or functionalities as needed."
