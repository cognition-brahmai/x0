I have a module named `rules` with the structure:\n\n```\nrules\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 conditions.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n```\nIn the script `conditions.py`, I want to import `RuleParserError` from `__init__.py`. However, when I run `conditions.py` as `__main__`, I'm getting an `ImportError: cannot import name RuleParserError` error. For the import, I've tried `from . import RuleParserError` as suggested in this [Python: How to import from an __init__.py file?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22282316/python-how-to-import-from-an-init-py-file) thread, but it didn't work."

        "content": "To import a class `RuleParserError` from the `__init__.py` file within the same directory as your `conditions.py` file, you need to ensure that your module is recognized as a package and that the import statement is correctly structured. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Ensure Package Structure**: The directory containing your files should be recognized as a package. This usually means that there should be an `__init__.py` file within the directory, which you already have.\n\n2. **Correct Import Statement**: In your `conditions.py` file, you should use a relative import to bring in the `RuleParserError` from the `__init__.py` file. Here's how you can do it:\n\n   ```python\n   from . import RuleParserError\n   ```\n\n   Make sure that `RuleParserError` is correctly defined in your `__init__.py` file.\n\n3. **Running the Script**: When you run `conditions.py` as `__main__`, Python might not recognize the directory as a package. To handle this, you can use the `-m` flag to run the package as a module. Navigate to the directory above `rules` and run the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m rules.conditions\n   ```\n\n   This tells Python to treat the `rules` directory as a package and should resolve the import error.\n\n4. **Alternative Approach**: If you must run `conditions.py` directly and do not want to use the `-m` flag, you can adjust your `PYTHONPATH` to include the directory containing `rules`, but this is generally less recommended as it can lead to issues with package management in larger projects.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to import `RuleParserError` from `__init__.py` without encountering an `ImportError`."
