        "content": "Yes, it is possible to configure dependencies for your package in your `setup.py` file such that they get installed automatically when you run `sudo python setup.py install`. Here's a breakdown of the concepts you're confused about:\n\n1. **`install_requires`**: This is the key argument you should use in your `setup.py` file to specify the dependencies your package needs. When you include a list of dependencies in `install_requires`, they will be installed automatically when your package is installed. Here's an example:\n\n   ```python\n   from setuptools import setup\n\n   setup(\n       name='your_package_name',\n       version='0.1',\n       packages=['your_package'],\n       install_requires=[\n           'numpy',\n           'requests',\n           # Add more dependencies as needed\n       ],\n   )\n   ```\n\n   In this example, `numpy` and `requests` will be installed automatically when you install your package.\n\n2. **`requires`**: This was used in older versions of Python's packaging system (Distutils), but it is largely deprecated and not recommended for use in modern packaging with `setuptools`. Instead, you should use `install_requires`.\n\n3. **`requirements.txt`**: This is a separate file often used to list all the dependencies for a project. It is commonly used in conjunction with `pip` to install dependencies, typically for development environments. While `requirements.txt` is not used directly in `setup.py`, it's a good practice to maintain this file for developers contributing to your project. You can install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using:\n\n   ```\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\nIn summary, for your package's dependencies to be installed automatically during installation, you should use the `install_requires` argument in your `setup.py` file. If you also have a `requirements.txt` for development or deployment purposes, you can maintain that separately for easy installation of dependencies in development environments."
