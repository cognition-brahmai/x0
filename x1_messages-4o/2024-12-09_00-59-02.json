The dataframes are defined as follows:\n\n```python\ndf=pd.DataFrame(index=['Arizona','New Mexico', 'Colorado'],columns=['A','B','C'], data=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])\nprint df\n\n            A  B  C\nArizona     1  2  3\nNew Mexico  4  5  6\nColorado    7  8  9\n\ndf2=pd.DataFrame(index=['Arizona','Colorado', 'New Mexico'], columns=['D'], data=['Orange','Blue','Green'])\nprint df2\n                 D\nArizona     Orange\nColorado      Blue\nNew Mexico   Green\n```\n\nCurrently, I am sorting df2 by joining it with df1, sorting, and then dropping the unused columns as shown below:\n\n```python\ndf.join(df2)[['D']]\n\n                 D\nArizona     Orange\nNew Mexico   Green\nColorado      Blue\n```\nHowever, I am interested in knowing if there is a more elegant way to sort the second dataframe by the index of the first dataframe."

Here's a more elegant approach using the `reindex` method:\n\n```python\ndf2_sorted = df2.reindex(df.index)\nprint(df2_sorted)\n```\n\nThis will give you `df2` sorted by the index of `df1`:\n\n```\n                 D\nArizona     Orange\nNew Mexico   Green\nColorado      Blue\n```\n\nThe `reindex` method rearranges the rows of `df2` to match the order of the index in `df1`, resulting in a more straightforward and efficient solution."
