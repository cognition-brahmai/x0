However, I am encountering a problem when I have to call functions that print messages to the console, which I am unable to modify. This is causing the progress bar display to be messed up. According to `tqdm`'s documentation, the method `tqdm.write()` can be used to write messages to the console without breaking the progress bar display. I have attempted to redirect `sys.stdout` to `tqdm.write()`, but my output is still getting messed up. I've also tried calling `tqdm.write(..., end=\"\")` inside `DummyFile.write()`, but the output is still not as expected. What am I missing?"

        "content": "It seems like you're dealing with a common issue when using `tqdm` alongside other console output in Python. When you want to ensure that the console messages do not interfere with the progress bar display, you can use `tqdm.write()` to safely write messages without disrupting the progress bar. However, redirecting `sys.stdout` to `tqdm.write()` directly may not work as intended because `tqdm.write()` is designed to be called as a function, not to be used as a file-like object.\n\nHere's a more effective approach to handle this situation:\n\n1. **Create a custom stream handler**: Redirect the standard output to a custom handler that uses `tqdm.write()` for its output. \n\n2. **Use context managers**: To ensure that each print statement or function call that prints to the console uses `tqdm.write()`.\n\nHere's a way to set up such a handler:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\n\nclass TqdmStream:\n    @staticmethod\n    def write(msg):\n        tqdm.write(msg, end='')\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def flush():\n        pass  # No operation needed for flush\n\n# Store the original stdout so you can restore it later\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n\n# Redirect stdout to TqdmStream\nsys.stdout = TqdmStream\n\n# Example of using tqdm with other prints\nwith tqdm(total=5) as pbar:\n    for i in range(5):\n        # Simulate a function that prints to the console\n        print(f\"Processing item {i}\")\n        pbar.update(1)\n\n# Restore the original stdout\nsys.stdout = original_stdout\n```\n\nIn this setup:\n\n- The `TqdmStream` class acts as a mock stream that directs all writes to `tqdm.write()`.\n- You replace `sys.stdout` with an instance of `TqdmStream`, which will ensure all print statements use `tqdm.write()`.\n- The `flush` method is included because some systems or libraries may attempt to call `flush()` on `sys.stdout`.\n\nBy following this approach, you should be able to maintain the integrity of your progress bar while still allowing other console output."
