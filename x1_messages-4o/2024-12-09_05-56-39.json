When my project has CUDA as one of its languages, CMake will locate CUDA, for example, it locates the nvcc binary. This is sufficient as long as I only compile CUDA code. However, what can I do if I want to compile a C++ target in that project? The CUDA includes are not -I'ed automatically, and CMakeCache.txt does not seem to contain the CUDA include path anywhere. Do I have to run something like find_package(CUDA 9.0 REQUIRED) even when CMake itself has already located CUDA? Or is there another way to obtain the include directory?"

        "content": "When you're using CMake with native CUDA support (since version 3.8), it's designed to handle CUDA as a first-class language. However, when you want to use CUDA-specific headers in your C++ targets, you need to ensure those paths are properly included.\n\nHere's how you can handle that in CMake:\n\n1. **Find CUDA Package:** Even though CMake natively supports CUDA, you may still need to use `find_package` to explicitly locate CUDA components and make them available to your C++ targets. This is especially important if you want to use CUDA-specific variables or paths.\n\n   ```cmake\n   find_package(CUDA 9.0 REQUIRED)\n   ```\n\n   This command will locate the CUDA toolkit and set various variables like `CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRS`, `CUDA_LIBRARIES`, etc.\n\n2. **Include CUDA Directories in C++ Targets:** Once you have located the CUDA package, you can manually include the CUDA include directories in your C++ target using `target_include_directories`.\n\n   ```cmake\n   target_include_directories(your_cpp_target PRIVATE ${CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRS})\n   ```\n\n   This will add the necessary CUDA include paths to your C++ target build process.\n\n3. **Link CUDA Libraries if Necessary:** If your C++ target also needs to link against CUDA libraries, you can include them using `target_link_libraries`.\n\n   ```cmake\n   target_link_libraries(your_cpp_target PRIVATE ${CUDA_LIBRARIES})\n   ```\n\n4. **Modern CMake with CUDA:** If you're using modern CMake, and you have both CUDA and C++ targets, you might want to use `cuda_add_library` or `cuda_add_executable` for CUDA targets and regular `add_library` or `add_executable` for C++ targets, while ensuring dependencies between them are properly defined.\n\nBy following these steps, you ensure that your C++ target is aware of the CUDA include directories and can use CUDA-specific headers correctly. This approach maintains the flexibility and correctness of your build system, allowing you to integrate CUDA components into your C++ workflow seamlessly."
