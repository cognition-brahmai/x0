I have `__init__` methods with clear docstring documentation, specifying the attributes the constructors take and their types. However, when I change these classes to use the new Python dataclasses in 3.7, the constructor becomes implicit. How can I provide constructor documentation in this situation?"

        "content": "When using Python's `dataclasses`, the `__init__` method is automatically generated, which can make documenting the constructor a bit different from the traditional approach. However, you can still document the constructor effectively by using the class-level docstring to describe the attributes. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Class-Level Docstring**: Use the class-level docstring to document the purpose of the class and each of its attributes. This is the most common way to provide documentation when using dataclasses.\n\n2. **Type Hints and Defaults**: You can use type hints and default values to make the class more self-documenting. These hints will be reflected in many IDEs and documentation tools.\n\nHere's an example of how you can document a dataclass:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\n@dataclass\nclass Example:\n    \"\"\"\n    Example class demonstrating how to document a dataclass.\n\n    Attributes:\n        attribute1 (int): Description of attribute1.\n        attribute2 (str): Description of attribute2. This attribute has a default value.\n        attribute3 (float): Description of attribute3.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    attribute1: int\n    attribute2: str = \"default\"\n    attribute3: float\n\n# Usage of the class\nexample_instance = Example(attribute1=10, attribute3=3.14)\n```\n\nIn this setup:\n\n- The class-level docstring describes the class and its attributes.\n- Each attribute is documented with its expected type and a short description.\n- Default values are specified within the class definition.\n\nBy following this approach, you ensure that anyone reading the code or using an IDE can easily understand the purpose and usage of each attribute in your dataclass. Additionally, tools like Sphinx can automatically generate documentation from these docstrings."
