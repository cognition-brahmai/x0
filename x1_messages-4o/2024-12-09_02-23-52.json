I have a list of variables and I want to loop through them to create class variables in this way:\n\n```python\nvars=('tx','ty','tz') #plus plenty more\n\nclass Foo():\n    for v in vars:\n        setattr(no_idea_what_should_go_here,v,0)\n```\n\nIs it possible to do this? I want to create these as class variables, not as instance variables (i.e., I don't want to use `self` in the `__init__` method)."

        "content": "Yes, you can create class variables dynamically in Python using the `setattr` function. Since you want these to be class variables, you will need to reference the class itself rather than an instance of the class. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nvars = ('tx', 'ty', 'tz')  # plus plenty more\n\nclass Foo:\n    pass\n\n# Setting class variables dynamically\nfor v in vars:\n    setattr(Foo, v, 0)\n\n# Testing if the class variables were set correctly\nprint(Foo.tx)  # Output: 0\nprint(Foo.ty)  # Output: 0\nprint(Foo.tz)  # Output: 0\n```\n\nIn this example, the `setattr` function is used to set attributes on the class `Foo` itself, which makes them class variables. After setting these attributes, you can access them directly via the class name, as shown in the `print` statements."
