        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"ImportError: No module named 'ServerSocket'\", suggests that there might be a typo or misunderstanding in the module name you are trying to import. In Python 3, the module you likely want to use is `socketserver`, not `SocketServer`. The `SocketServer` module was used in Python 2, and it has been renamed to `socketserver` in Python 3.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to work with Python 3:\n\n1. Replace `import SocketServer` with `import socketserver`.\n\n2. If you are using any specific classes or functions from this module, make sure the names and their usages comply with the Python 3 naming conventions and structure.\n\nHere's a simple example of how a TCP server can be set up using `socketserver` in Python 3:\n\n```python\nimport socketserver\n\nclass MyTCPHandler(socketserver.BaseRequestHandler):\n    def handle(self):\n        # self.request is the TCP socket connected to the client\n        self.data = self.request.recv(1024).strip()\n        print(f\"{self.client_address[0]} wrote:\")\n        print(self.data)\n        # send back the same data, but upper-cased\n        self.request.sendall(self.data.upper())\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    HOST, PORT = \"localhost\", 9999\n\n    # Create the server, binding to localhost on port 9999\n    with socketserver.TCPServer((HOST, PORT), MyTCPHandler) as server:\n        # Activate the server; this will keep running until you\n        # interrupt the program with Ctrl-C\n        server.serve_forever()\n```\n\nMake sure to check the Python documentation for any updates or changes in the API if you encounter any further issues. Additionally, if you have older code, do a thorough check to ensure all module names and functions are updated for Python 3 compatibility."
