Nevertheless, to tackle this problem, you must first compute the summation of each number's individual digits and add those three results. Proceed to find the odd integers' product solely if the aggregate sum surpasses 20. This task necessitates meticulous and comprehensive calculation, as well as multi-step reasoning, such as figuring out the three consecutive odd integers, calculating the sum of their digits, and checking if it is greater than 20 before finally computing their product."

        "content": "To solve the problem, we need to identify three sequential odd integers that are 19 apart from each other. Let\u2019s consider the first odd integer as \\( x \\).\n\nThe three integers can then be expressed as:\n- First integer: \\( x \\)\n- Second integer: \\( x + 19 \\)\n- Third integer: \\( x + 38 \\)\n\nNext, we need to calculate the sum of the digits of each integer and add these sums together.\n\n### Step 1: Sum of the digits\n\n1. **First integer: \\( x \\)**\n   - Sum of digits: Let's denote this sum as \\( S_1 \\).\n\n2. **Second integer: \\( x + 19 \\)**\n   - Sum of digits: Denote this sum as \\( S_2 \\).\n\n3. **Third integer: \\( x + 38 \\)**\n   - Sum of digits: Denote this sum as \\( S_3 \\).\n\nThe total sum of the digits is \\( S_1 + S_2 + S_3 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Check the condition\nWe need to find whether \\( S_1 + S_2 + S_3 > 20 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the product\nIf the sum of the digits exceeds 20, calculate the product of the three integers.\n\n### Let's choose a specific odd integer for \\( x \\) to illustrate the calculation:\n\n#### Example: Let \\( x = 11 \\)\n\n1. **First integer: \\( x = 11 \\)**\n   - Sum of digits: \\( S_1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \\)\n\n2. **Second integer: \\( x + 19 = 30 \\)**\n   - Sum of digits: \\( S_2 = 3 + 0 = 3 \\)\n\n3. **Third integer: \\( x + 38 = 49 \\)**\n   - Sum of digits: \\( S_3 = 4 + 9 = 13 \\)\n\nNow, calculate the total sum of the digits:\n\\[ S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 2 + 3 + 13 = 18 \\]\n\nSince 18 is not greater than 20, we do not compute the product of these integers.\n\n#### Example: Let \\( x = 13 \\)\n\n1. **First integer: \\( x = 13 \\)**\n   - Sum of digits: \\( S_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 \\)\n\n2. **Second integer: \\( x + 19 = 32 \\)**\n   - Sum of digits: \\( S_2 = 3 + 2 = 5 \\)\n\n3. **Third integer: \\( x + 38 = 51 \\)**\n   - Sum of digits: \\( S_3 = 5 + 1 = 6 \\)\n\nNow, calculate the total sum of the digits:\n\\[ S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \\]\n\nSince 15 is not greater than 20, we do not compute the product of these integers.\n\n#### Example: Let \\( x = 17 \\)\n\n1. **First integer: \\( x = 17 \\)**\n   - Sum of digits: \\( S_1 = 1 + 7 = 8 \\)\n\n2. **Second integer: \\( x + 19 = 36 \\)**\n   - Sum of digits: \\( S_2 = 3 + 6 = 9 \\)\n\n3. **Third integer: \\( x + 38 = 55 \\)**\n   - Sum of digits: \\( S_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 \\)\n\nNow, calculate the total sum of the digits:\n\\[ S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 8 + 9 + 10 = 27 \\]\n\nSince 27 is greater than 20, we proceed to calculate the product of these integers:\n\\[ 17 \\times 36 \\times 55 = 33660 \\]\n\nTherefore, the product of the three integers is 33,660."
