You can use Python to help with this. Open a terminal and run:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m django --version\n   ```\n\n   This will show you the installed version of Django, confirming it's installed.\n\n   Now, run the following command to find the installation path:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 -c \"import django; print(django.__path__)\"\n   ```\n\n   This command will print the directory where Django is installed, typically something like `/usr/local/lib/python3.x/dist-packages/django`.\n\n2. **Locate the `__init__.py` File**:\n   Once you have the path, navigate to it in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd /path/to/your/django/installation\n   ```\n\n   Replace `/path/to/your/django/installation` with the actual path you found from the previous command.\n\n3. **Find `__init__.py`**:\n   Now, you can search for the `__init__.py` file within the Django directory:\n\n   ```bash\n   find . -name '__init__.py'\n   ```\n\n   This will list all the `__init__.py` files within the Django directories. The `__init__.py` files are typically used to mark directories on disk as Python package directories, and you'll find several of them in the Django codebase.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to locate the specific `__init__.py` file you are looking for within the Django installation on your Ubuntu system."
