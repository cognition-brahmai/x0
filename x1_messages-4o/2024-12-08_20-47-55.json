Below is a sample code that demonstrates how to achieve this:\n\n```python\n# Define the phrase and the parts to be styled\nphrase = \"The cat meowed\"\nregular_text = \"The cat\"\nitalic_text = \"meowed\"\n\n# Define the CSS for styling\ncss_style = \"\"\"\n<style>\n    .regular {\n        font-size: 16px;\n    }\n    .italic {\n        font-style: italic;\n        font-size: 18px; /* 2 points larger than the regular font size */\n    }\n</style>\n\"\"\"\n\n# Create the HTML with embedded CSS\nhtml_content = f\"\"\"\n{css_style}\n<div>\n    <span class=\"regular\">{regular_text}</span> \n    <span class=\"italic\">{italic_text}</span>\n</div>\n\"\"\"\n\n# Print the HTML content\nprint(html_content)\n```\n\nWhen this code is executed in a Python environment, it generates an HTML string with embedded CSS styles that you can use in a web page. The part of the phrase \"The cat\" is styled with a regular font, while \"meowed\" is italicized and has a font size 2 points larger than the regular text.\n\nTo view the result, you can save the output HTML content into an `.html` file and open it in a web browser."
