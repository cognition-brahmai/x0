I have a file structure as shown below:\n\n```\n/my/Python/jmLib2\n     |--- Phone\n     |      |--- __init__.py\n     |      |--- Pots.py\n     |- Test2.py\n```\n\nIn the Pots.py file, I have a simple function:\n\n```python\ndef Pots():\n    print (\"I'm Pots Phone\")\n```\n\nIn the __init__.py file, I'm importing the Pots function from the Pots module:\n\n```python\nfrom Pots import Pots\n```\n\nIn the Test2.py file, I'm importing the Pots function from the Phone module and then calling the function:\n\n```python\nfrom Phone import Pots\n\nimport os.path\nprint (\"OS:\"+str(os.path))\n\nPots()\n```\n\nWhen I run the Test2.py with Python 2, it works fine:\n\n```\npython2 Test2.py\nOS:<module 'posixpath' from '/usr/lib/python2.7/posixpath.pyc'>\n    I'm Pots Phone*\n```\n\nHowever, when I run the same file with Python 3, it throws an ImportError:\n\n```\npython3 Test2.py\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"Test2.py\", line 2, in <module>\n    from Phone import Pots\n  File \"/home/juergen/my/Python/jmLib2/Phone/__init__.py\", line 1, in <module>\n    from Pots import Pots\nImportError: No module named 'Pots'\n```\n\nI'm using PyDev under Eclipse and it shows me an \"Unresolved import: Pots\" error inside the __init__.py file. I receive the same traceback error under PyDev and bash. Could you explain the difference between python2 and python3.4 in this context? Do I need to modify the PYTHONPATH? If so, why?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering stems from differences in how Python 2 and Python 3 handle module imports, particularly relative imports.\n\n### Python 2 vs Python 3 Import Differences:\n\n1. **Implicit Relative Imports (Python 2):**\n   - In Python 2, when you write `from Pots import Pots` in `__init__.py`, it implicitly looks for `Pots.py` within the same package. This is known as an implicit relative import, which was the default behavior in Python 2.\n\n2. **Explicit Relative Imports (Python 3):**\n   - Python 3 requires explicit relative imports to avoid ambiguity. In Python 3, the line `from Pots import Pots` is treated as an absolute import by default, meaning it looks for a top-level module named `Pots`, not a module within the current package.\n\n### How to Fix the Issue for Python 3:\n\nTo resolve this, you should use an explicit relative import in `__init__.py`:\n\n```python\nfrom .Pots import Pots\n```\n\nThe `.` indicates that `Pots` should be imported from the current package.\n\n### Modifying the PYTHONPATH:\n\n- The `PYTHONPATH` environment variable is used to specify additional directories where Python should look for modules and packages. In your case, if `jmLib2` is not in the PYTHONPATH, Python might not find the `Phone` package.\n- However, since Python 3's import mechanism changes should resolve the issue, modifying `PYTHONPATH` may not be necessary unless your directory structure or execution context requires it.\n\n### Additional Steps:\n\n1. Make sure that the directory where `Test2.py` is located is included in the PYTHONPATH or that you're executing `Test2.py` from the `jmLib2` directory.\n   \n2. If you want to ensure consistency between Python 2 and Python 3, you can use explicit relative imports in both versions.\n\n### Summary:\n\n- Change `from Pots import Pots` to `from .Pots import Pots` in `__init__.py`.\n- Ensure `jmLib2` is in your PYTHONPATH or run from the correct directory.\n- Python 3 prefers explicit relative imports for clarity and to avoid potential conflicts with similarly named modules at different levels in the hierarchy."
