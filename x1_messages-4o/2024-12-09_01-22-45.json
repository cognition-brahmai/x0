        "content": "You can split a large DataFrame into two random samples for training and testing purposes using the `pandas` library by following these steps:\n\n1. **Shuffle the DataFrame**: First, shuffle the DataFrame to ensure randomness.\n2. **Split the DataFrame**: Divide the DataFrame into training and testing datasets with the desired proportions.\n\nHere's a step-by-step example of how to do this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assume 'df' is your large DataFrame\n# For demonstration, let's create a sample DataFrame\ndata = {'A': range(1, 101), 'B': range(101, 201)}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Step 1: Shuffle the DataFrame\ndf_shuffled = df.sample(frac=1, random_state=42).reset_index(drop=True)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the split index\ntrain_size = int(0.8 * len(df_shuffled))\n\n# Step 3: Split the DataFrame\ntrain_df = df_shuffled[:train_size]\ntest_df = df_shuffled[train_size:]\n\n# Display the results\nprint(\"Training DataFrame:\")\nprint(train_df.head())\nprint(\"\\nTesting DataFrame:\")\nprint(test_df.head())\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`df.sample(frac=1, random_state=42)`**: This shuffles the entire DataFrame. The `frac=1` parameter indicates that we want to sample the entire DataFrame, effectively shuffling it. The `random_state` is used for reproducibility.\n- **`reset_index(drop=True)`**: This resets the index of the shuffled DataFrame, dropping the old index.\n- **Calculate the split index**: By multiplying the total length of the DataFrame by 0.8, we get the number of rows that should go into the training set.\n- **Slicing**: We use slicing to divide the DataFrame into training and testing sets.\n\nBy following these steps, you will have two DataFrames: one for training (80% of the data) and one for testing (20% of the data)."
