Here's how you can write the equivalent of your Python statement in Swift:\n\n```swift\nif (a > 0 && i == j) || f < 3 {\n    // do something\n}\n```\n\nIn this Swift code:\n\n- `&&` is used for the logical AND operation.\n- `||` is used for the logical OR operation.\n\nThe parentheses around `(a > 0 && i == j)` are optional but can help clarify the precedence of operations, ensuring that the conditions are evaluated as intended."
