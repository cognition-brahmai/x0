I am trying to find out the corresponding P-value using Python, specifically using the scipy library. However, when I use the chi2 distribution's probability density function (pdf) from scipy like this:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy import stats\nstats.chi2.pdf(3.84 , 1)\n```\n\nI get a value of 0.029846. But, according to my colleagues and some online resources, the expected value should be 0.05. Could someone guide me towards the correct way to find the P-value?"

        "content": "Certainly! It looks like there is a bit of confusion between using the probability density function (pdf) and what you actually need, which is the cumulative distribution function (cdf) to find the P-value.\n\nThe probability density function (pdf) gives you the height of the distribution at a given point, which is not what you're looking for when trying to find a P-value. Instead, you want to use the cumulative distribution function (cdf) to find the probability that a chi-square random variable is less than or equal to your test statistic.\n\nHowever, to find the P-value, you typically want the probability that the test statistic is greater than or equal to the observed value, which is 1 minus the cdf value.\n\nHere's how you can do it with `scipy`:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy import stats\n\n# Test statistic\ntest_statistic = 3.84\n# Degrees of freedom\ndf = 1\n\n# Calculate the P-value\np_value = 1 - stats.chi2.cdf(test_statistic, df)\nprint(p_value)\n```\n\nThis will give you the correct P-value. For a test statistic of 3.84 with 1 degree of freedom, the P-value should be approximately 0.05, which is what you were expecting."
