Perform the integer division:  \n   \\(10 \\div 3 = 3\\) (since it's integer division, it discards the remainder)\n\n3. Multiply the result of the division by 4:  \n   \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\)\n\n4. Subtract the multiplication result from the exponentiation result:  \n   \\(32 - 12 = 20\\)\n\nSo, the result of the expression \\(2^{5} - 10 \\div 3 \\times 4\\) is 20."
