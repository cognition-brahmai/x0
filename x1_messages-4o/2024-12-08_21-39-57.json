Here's a rewritten version of the sentence:\n\n\"Numerous residents of New York City employ this phrase to describe the metropolis that is always active.\"\n\nAs for automating this task using Python, you can use libraries like `transformers` from Hugging Face, which provide pre-trained models capable of paraphrasing. Here's an example of how you might set this up:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\n# Initialize the paraphrasing pipeline\nparaphrase_pipeline = pipeline(\"text2text-generation\", model=\"t5-base\")\n\n# Original sentence\nsentence = \"Many inhabitants of the Big Apple use this term to refer to the City that Never Sleeps.\"\n\n# Generate paraphrases\nparaphrases = paraphrase_pipeline(sentence, max_length=100, num_return_sequences=1)\n\n# Output the paraphrased sentence\nprint(paraphrases[0]['generated_text'])\n```\n\nThis code uses the T5 model to generate a paraphrase of the input sentence. The `transformers` library provides a simple interface to work with complex models, making it easy to perform tasks like paraphrasing."
