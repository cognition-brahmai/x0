        "content": "To install Python 3.6 alongside Python 3.7 on your Mac and set it up for TensorFlow, you can use a virtual environment. This approach ensures that you don't disrupt your existing Python setup. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n### Step 1: Install Python 3.6\n\n1. **Download Python 3.6 Installer:**\n   - Go to the official Python website and download the installer for Python 3.6: [Python Releases for Mac OS X](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/).\n   - Choose a specific version like 3.6.9 or another 3.6.x release.\n\n2. **Install Python 3.6:**\n   - Run the downloaded installer and follow the instructions to install Python 3.6 on your system.\n\n### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment with Python 3.6\n\n1. **Install `virtualenv`:**\n   - Open Terminal and install `virtualenv` if it's not already installed:\n     ```bash\n     python3.7 -m pip install virtualenv\n     ```\n\n2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**\n   - Navigate to the directory where you want to create your virtual environment.\n   - Create a virtual environment using Python 3.6:\n     ```bash\n     virtualenv -p /usr/local/bin/python3.6 my_tf_env\n     ```\n   - Replace `/usr/local/bin/python3.6` with the actual path to your Python 3.6 executable if it's different. You can find this path by running `which python3.6`.\n\n3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**\n   - Activate the virtual environment:\n     ```bash\n     source my_tf_env/bin/activate\n     ```\n\n### Step 3: Install TensorFlow\n\n1. **Install TensorFlow:**\n   - With the virtual environment activated, install TensorFlow:\n     ```bash\n     pip install tensorflow==1.10\n     ```\n   - Ensure you specify a version compatible with Python 3.6 if necessary.\n\n2. **Verify Installation:**\n   - Run Python and import TensorFlow to ensure it is installed correctly:\n     ```bash\n     python\n     >>> import tensorflow as tf\n     >>> print(tf.__version__)\n     ```\n\n### Step 4: Using the Virtual Environment\n\n- Whenever you want to work with TensorFlow, activate your virtual environment:\n  ```bash\n  source my_tf_env/bin/activate\n  ```\n- To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run:\n  ```bash\n  deactivate\n  ```\n\nThis setup allows you to maintain multiple Python versions on your Mac without disrupting your existing setup."
