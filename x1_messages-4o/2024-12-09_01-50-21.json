When I use them to get the value of an environment variable, they seem to return the same result. Here is the code I am using for reference:\n\n```python\n>>> os.getenv('TERM')\n'xterm'\n>>> os.environ.get('TERM')\n'xterm'\n\n>>> os.getenv('FOOBAR', \"not found\") == \"not found\"\nTrue\n>>> os.environ.get('FOOBAR', \"not found\") == \"not found\"\nTrue\n```\nThey appear to have identical functionality. Is this the case?"

        "content": "Yes, `os.getenv` and `os.environ.get` are functionally equivalent when it comes to retrieving the value of an environment variable in Python. Both methods allow you to access environment variables and provide a way to specify a default value if the environment variable is not set.\n\nHere\u2019s a brief overview of both:\n\n1. **`os.getenv(key, default=None)`**: \n   - This is a convenient function provided by the `os` module specifically for getting environment variables.\n   - It takes two arguments: the key (name of the environment variable) and an optional default value to return if the environment variable is not found.\n\n2. **`os.environ.get(key, default=None)`**:\n   - `os.environ` is a dictionary-like object that represents the environment variables.\n   - The `get` method of this dictionary-like object works similarly to the `get` method of a regular Python dictionary. It allows you to specify a key and an optional default value.\n\nIn both cases, if the environment variable specified by `key` exists, its value is returned. If it does not exist, the specified `default` value is returned. The default is `None` if not otherwise specified.\n\nIn your examples, both `os.getenv` and `os.environ.get` return `'xterm'` for the existing environment variable `TERM`, and both return `\"not found\"` for the non-existing environment variable `FOOBAR` when a default value is provided. This demonstrates their functional equivalence in this context."
