        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that the `OrderingFilter` class being used does not have a `filter_queryset` method, which is expected by Django REST Framework. This issue often arises due to a mismatch in imports or a version conflict. Let's go through a few steps to resolve this:\n\n1. **Correct Import**: Ensure that you are importing `OrderingFilter` from the correct package. For Django REST Framework, it should be imported from `rest_framework.filters`, not `django_filters.rest_framework`.\n\n   ```python\n   from rest_framework import viewsets\n   from rest_framework.filters import OrderingFilter\n   from django_filters.rest_framework import DjangoFilterBackend, FilterSet\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure that both Django REST Framework and django-filter are properly installed and compatible with each other. Sometimes, version mismatches can cause issues like this. Upgrade them to the latest versions if necessary.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade djangorestframework django-filter\n   ```\n\n3. **Review ViewSet Configuration**: Your `ListingViewSet` appears to be correctly configured for filtering and ordering. However, ensure that `ListFilter` (referred to as `filter_class`) is correctly defined if you still intend to use it. Otherwise, you can remove it if you only intend to use ordering.\n\n4. **Import Viewsets**: Make sure you have imported `viewsets` correctly if there are any typos in your code.\n\n5. **Remove Unnecessary Code**: If you are not using any custom filters with `FilterSet`, you can remove the `filter_class` line.\n\nHere's a refined version of your code:\n\n```python\nfrom rest_framework import viewsets\nfrom rest_framework.filters import OrderingFilter\nfrom django_filters.rest_framework import DjangoFilterBackend\n\nclass ListingViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):\n    queryset = Listing.objects.all()\n    serializer_class = ListingSerializer\n    filter_backends = (DjangoFilterBackend, OrderingFilter,)\n    ordering_fields = ('price', 'views')\n    ordering = ('price',)\n```\n\nBy making sure these points are covered, you should be able to resolve the error you're encountering. If the issue persists, double-check your project settings and installed apps to ensure everything is correctly configured."
