        "content": "Why don't os.getenv and os.environ in Python 2.7.4 on Ubuntu 13.04 recognize the environment variables of my bash shell? For instance, when I set a variable 'A' and try to access it using os.getenv('A'), it returns None. Even os.environ['A'] throws a KeyError. However, both functions work fine with the 'PATH' variable and also recognize changes in it. The problem also arises with the 'PYTHONPATH' variable. What could be the cause of this issue?\n\nHere's an example of the issue I'm facing:\n\n```bash\n$ echo $A\n5\n$ python -c 'import os; print os.getenv( \"A\" )'\nNone\n$ python -c 'import os; print os.environ[ \"A\" ]'\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/UserDict.py\", line 23, in __getitem__\n    raise KeyError(key)\nKeyError: 'A'\n```\n\nFor the 'PATH' variable, it works fine:\n\n```bash\n$ echo $PATH \n/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\n$ python -c 'import os; print os.getenv(\"PATH\")'\n/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\n```\n\nAnd it notices changes in 'PATH':\n\n```bash\n$ PATH=\"/home/alex/tests/:$PATH\"\n$ echo $PATH \n/home/alex/tests/:/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\n$ python -c 'import os; print os.getenv(\"PATH\")'\n/home/alex/tests/:/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games\n```\n\nBut with 'PYTHONPATH', I experience the problem:\n\n```bash\n$ python -c 'import os; print os.getenv(\"PYTHONPATH\")'\nNone\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with environment variables not being recognized by Python scripts when set in the shell can often be attributed to how the environment variables are being set and how the shell and subprocesses interact. Here are a few things to check and try:\n\n1. **Export the Variable:**\n   Variables set in a shell session are not automatically exported to subprocesses unless explicitly marked for export. When you set a variable using `A=5`, it's only available in that shell session. To make it available to subprocesses (like the Python interpreter), you need to export it:\n\n   ```bash\n   export A=5\n   ```\n\n   After exporting, try running your Python script again.\n\n2. **Subshells:**\n   Ensure that you are not launching the Python interpreter from a new shell session that doesn't inherit the current environment. For example, using a command like:\n\n   ```bash\n   bash -c 'python -c \"import os; print os.getenv(\\\"A\\\")\"'\n   ```\n\n   This would start a new shell session, and you would need to export `A` in this new session as well.\n\n3. **Check Shell Configuration Files:**\n   If you're setting your environment variables in a shell configuration file (like `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.profile`), ensure that these files are being sourced correctly. For interactive shells, `.bashrc` is typically sourced, but for login shells, `.bash_profile` or `.profile` might be used.\n\n4. **Terminal Session:**\n   After setting an environment variable and exporting it, make sure to run your Python script in the same terminal session. If you open a new terminal, the environment variable needs to be set and exported again unless it's in a configuration file that's sourced on terminal startup.\n\n5. **Environment Isolation:**\n   If using a virtual environment or any containerization tools, ensure that the environment variables are set within the context of that environment.\n\n6. **Debugging:**\n   You can print all environment variables to see if `A` is present:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -c 'import os; print os.environ'\n   ```\n\n   This can help verify whether `A` is being passed to the Python process.\n\n7. **Shell Scripting:**\n   If you're running these commands within a script, ensure that the script is sourcing the environment correctly. You might need to run the script with a command like `source myscript.sh` to ensure it affects the current shell session.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to diagnose why the environment variables are not being recognized by your Python script."
