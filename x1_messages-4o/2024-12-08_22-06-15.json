Specifically, how can I add the phrase \"(Secret Time Traveler)\" to the end of any title that includes John's name?"

        "content": "To generate a book title that reflects the protagonist John's need to keep his time traveling a secret, you can modify your Swift code to append the phrase \"(Secret Time Traveler)\" only when the name \"John\" is used. Your existing logic is almost there; you just need to ensure that the condition to append this phrase is correctly applied. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```swift\nlet titleWords = [\"Chrono\", \"Temporal\", \"Anachronistic\", \"Timeless\", \"Era\", \"Ticking\", \"Time\", \"Timewalker\", \"Chronicles\", \"Chronicles of\"]\nlet locationWords = [\"Secrets\", \"Mystery\", \"Lost\", \"Forgotten\", \"Hidden\", \"Enigma\", \"Unknown\"]\nlet nameWords = [\"John\", \"Jonathan\", \"Jack\", \"Jacob\", \"Jules\", \"James\", \"Justin\"]\n\nvar titles: [String] = []\n\nfor i in titleWords {\n    for j in locationWords {\n        for k in nameWords {\n            var title = \"\\(i) \\(j) of \\(k)\"\n            if k == \"John\" {\n                title += \" (Secret Time Traveler)\"\n            }\n            titles.append(title)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Output the titles\nfor title in titles {\n    print(title)\n}\n```\n\nThis code iterates through all possible combinations of title, location, and name words. When the name \"John\" is used in the title, it appends \"(Secret Time Traveler)\" to the end of the title. The result is a list of book titles, each reflecting the theme of secrecy associated with John's time traveling."
