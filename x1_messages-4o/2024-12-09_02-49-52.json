To check if a variable is a string, you would use `isinstance()` with `str` as the type. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nx = \"Hello, World!\"\n\n# Check if x is a string\nif isinstance(x, str):\n    print(\"x is a string.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"x is not a string.\")\n```\n\nIn this example, `isinstance(x, str)` returns `True` if `x` is a string, and `False` otherwise. This is a common and effective way to check the type of a variable in Python."
