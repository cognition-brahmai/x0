        "content": "In Python 3.4, the new module Enum has been introduced which allows to add an enumerated type to the language. When working with this new module, I have encountered a scenario where I need to define a class constant inside an Enum. However, whenever I try to do that, it simply gets added as one of the members of the enum, which is not what I want. Take the following example code:\n\n```python\nclass Planet(Enum):\n    MERCURY = (3.303e+23, 2.4397e6)\n    VENUS   = (4.869e+24, 6.0518e6)\n    EARTH   = (5.976e+24, 6.37814e6)\n    MARS    = (6.421e+23, 3.3972e6)\n    JUPITER = (1.9e+27,   7.1492e7)\n    SATURN  = (5.688e+26, 6.0268e7)\n    URANUS  = (8.686e+25, 2.5559e7)\n    NEPTUNE = (1.024e+26, 2.4746e7)\n    def __init__(self, mass, radius):\n        self.mass = mass       # in kilograms\n        self.radius = radius   # in meters\n    @property\n    def surface_gravity(self):\n        # universal gravitational constant  (m3 kg-1 s-2)\n        G = 6.67300E-11\n        return G * self.mass / (self.radius * self.radius)\n```\n\nIn the method 'surface_gravity', I have a constant 'G' which I would normally define at the class level. If I wanted to use this constant in other methods, I would have to define it there as well which is not ideal. Is there any way to define a class constant inside an Enum, or some other workaround to achieve the same effect?"

        "content": "In Python's `Enum` classes, defining class-level constants that are not treated as enum members can be a bit tricky. However, you can achieve this by defining such constants outside of the `Enum` members. You can define them within the class, but outside of the enum members, as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom enum import Enum\n\nclass Planet(Enum):\n    # Universal gravitational constant (m3 kg-1 s-2)\n    G = 6.67300E-11\n\n    MERCURY = (3.303e+23, 2.4397e6)\n    VENUS   = (4.869e+24, 6.0518e6)\n    EARTH   = (5.976e+24, 6.37814e6)\n    MARS    = (6.421e+23, 3.3972e6)\n    JUPITER = (1.9e+27,   7.1492e7)\n    SATURN  = (5.688e+26, 6.0268e7)\n    URANUS  = (8.686e+25, 2.5559e7)\n    NEPTUNE = (1.024e+26, 2.4746e7)\n\n    def __init__(self, mass, radius):\n        self.mass = mass       # in kilograms\n        self.radius = radius   # in meters\n\n    @property\n    def surface_gravity(self):\n        return self.G * self.mass / (self.radius * self.radius)\n\n# Example usage\nprint(Planet.EARTH.surface_gravity)\n```\n\nIn this modified version, `G` is defined as a class attribute and not treated as an enum member because it's defined before the enum members (`MERCURY`, `VENUS`, etc.). This way, you can access `G` within any method of the `Planet` class. The `surface_gravity` method now uses `self.G` to refer to the gravitational constant.\n\nNote that class attributes like `G` should be placed before any enum members to ensure they are not interpreted as part of the enum. This structure allows you to use `G` across different methods within the `Planet` enum class without redefining it."
