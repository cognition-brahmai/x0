        "content": "Certainly! To create a program in Python that converts a given number from base 10 to base 5, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Take an input number in base 10.\n2. Divide the number by 5 and store the remainder.\n3. Update the number by dividing it by 5 (ignoring the remainder).\n4. Repeat steps 2-3 until the number becomes 0.\n5. The base 5 representation is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n\nHere's a simple Python program to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef convert_to_base_5(number):\n    if number == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    \n    base_5 = []\n    while number > 0:\n        remainder = number % 5\n        base_5.append(str(remainder))\n        number //= 5\n    \n    # The base 5 digits are collected in reverse order\n    base_5.reverse()\n    \n    return ''.join(base_5)\n\n# Example usage\ndecimal_number = int(input(\"Enter a base 10 number: \"))\nbase_5_representation = convert_to_base_5(decimal_number)\nprint(f\"The base 5 representation of {decimal_number} is: {base_5_representation}\")\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `convert_to_base_5` that takes a base 10 number and returns its base 5 representation. You can input any base 10 number, and the program will output its equivalent in base 5."
