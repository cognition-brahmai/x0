For example, I have the following strings: \n\n```python\nx= '$120'\ny = ' 90 Degrees F'\nbanana = '200 kgm'\norange = '300 gm'\ntotal_weight = banana + orange/1000 \n```\nI want to perform some operations like adding the weights, for instance: \n```python\ntotal_weight  = 200 + 300/1000\n```\nI am trying to extract the numbers only to do these operations. What would be the simplest way to do this, given that I'm only dealing with two formats where digits are either at the beginning or at the end of the string?"

        "content": "To extract numbers from strings that may have units or symbols at the beginning or end, you can use regular expressions, which is a powerful tool for pattern matching in strings. In Python, the `re` module provides support for regular expressions. Here's how you can extract the numbers and perform the operations you mentioned:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Function to extract the first number from a string\ndef extract_number(s):\n    # Search for the first sequence of digits in the string\n    match = re.search(r'\\d+(\\.\\d+)?', s)\n    # If a match is found, convert it to a float, otherwise return 0\n    return float(match.group()) if match else 0\n\n# Example strings\nx = '$120'\ny = ' 90 Degrees F'\nbanana = '200 kgm'\norange = '300 gm'\n\n# Extract numbers from strings\nx_number = extract_number(x)  # 120\ny_number = extract_number(y)  # 90\nbanana_number = extract_number(banana)  # 200\norange_number = extract_number(orange)  # 300\n\n# Perform calculations\ntotal_weight = banana_number + orange_number / 1000  # 200 + 0.3\n\nprint(f\"Total weight: {total_weight} kg\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Regular Expression (`\\d+(\\.\\d+)?`)**: \n  - `\\d+` matches one or more digits.\n  - `(\\.\\d+)?` is an optional group that matches a decimal point followed by one or more digits (for handling decimal numbers).\n- **`re.search()`**: This function searches the string for the pattern and returns the first occurrence.\n- **Conversion to float**: The match found is converted to a float to handle both integer and decimal numbers.\n- **Edge Cases**: If no number is found, it returns 0 to handle cases where there's no digit in the string.\n\nThis method should be efficient and robust for your described use case."
