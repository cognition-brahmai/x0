I tried to use a list comprehension to achieve this with the following code: \n\n```python\nlst_gen = [i, i*i for i in range(1, 10)]\n```\nHowever, I am encountering a syntax error. What would be the correct way to generate this list using list comprehension?"

        "content": "The syntax error you are encountering is due to the fact that you are trying to generate multiple elements from a single iteration in the list comprehension, which is not directly supported in that form. However, you can achieve your desired output by creating a tuple for each iteration and then flattening the list. \n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nlst_gen = [x for i in range(1, 10) for x in (i, i*i)]\n```\n\nThis list comprehension works by generating a tuple `(i, i*i)` for each `i` in the range, and then iterating over each element `x` in that tuple to add them to the final list. As a result, the list will be flattened, and you'll get your desired sequence of numbers and their squares."
