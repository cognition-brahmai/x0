Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\n# Get the current date and time\ncurrent_time = datetime.datetime.now()\n\n# Separate the current time into individual components\nyear = current_time.year\nmonth = current_time.month\nday = current_time.day\nhour = current_time.hour\nminute = current_time.minute\n\n# Print the separated components\nprint(\"Year:\", year)\nprint(\"Month:\", month)\nprint(\"Day:\", day)\nprint(\"Hour:\", hour)\nprint(\"Minute:\", minute)\n```\n\nThis code snippet uses `datetime.datetime.now()` to get the current date and time, and then extracts the year, month, day, hour, and minute from the `datetime` object."
