My code follows this pattern:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    foo(a, b)\nexcept Exception, e:\n    baz(e)\ntry:\n    bar(c, d)\nexcept Exception, e:\n    baz(e)\n...\n```\n\nThis same pattern occurs when exceptions simply need to be ignored. However, I find this approach to be redundant and the excessive syntax makes the code difficult to read. In C, I would have solved this type of problem easily with a macro, but this cannot be done in Python. How can I best reduce the code footprint and increase code readability when coming across this pattern?"

        "content": "To reduce redundancy and improve readability when handling exceptions in Python, you can create a helper function to encapsulate the try-except pattern. This way, you can simply call this helper function whenever you need to execute a command and handle exceptions. Here's an example of how you might implement this:\n\n```python\ndef execute_with_handling(func, *args, **kwargs):\n    try:\n        return func(*args, **kwargs)\n    except Exception as e:\n        baz(e)\n\n# Usage:\nexecute_with_handling(foo, a, b)\nexecute_with_handling(bar, c, d)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `execute_with_handling` function takes a function `func` and its arguments `*args` and `**kwargs`. It executes `func` with those arguments and handles any exceptions by calling the `baz` function with the exception `e`.\n\nThis approach allows you to reduce the repetitive try-except blocks and makes your code cleaner and more maintainable. You can also extend the `execute_with_handling` function to handle exceptions in different ways or to log additional information if needed."
