I have tried the following code, but I'm wondering if there is a simpler or more efficient way to achieve this.\n\n```python\nimport string\ns = \"string. With. Punctuation?\" # Sample string \nout = s.translate(string.maketrans(\"\",\"\"), string.punctuation)\n```"

        "content": "The code snippet you provided uses `string.maketrans()` and `translate()` from Python 2, which are not available in Python 3. Since Python 3 is the current version, it's important to adapt the code accordingly. In Python 3, the `translate()` method works differently. Here's an efficient way to remove punctuation from a string in Python 3:\n\n```python\nimport string\n\ns = \"string. With. Punctuation?\"  # Sample string\ntranslator = str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)\nout = s.translate(translator)\n\nprint(out)  # Output: 'string With Punctuation'\n```\n\nThis code uses `str.maketrans()` to create a translation table that maps each punctuation character to `None`, and then `translate()` removes these characters from the string. This method is efficient and leverages built-in functions for optimal performance in Python 3."
