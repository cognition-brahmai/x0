        "content": "To accomplish this task using Scala, you'll need to use a library like Slick, an FRM (Functional Relational Mapping) library for Scala, or JDBC for direct database access. Below, I'll provide a simple example using JDBC, which is more straightforward for basic database operations.\n\n### Step 1: Set up PostgreSQL Database and Table\n\nFirst, ensure that you have the PostgreSQL JDBC driver included in your project. You can add it via your build tool, like SBT or Maven.\n\nHere's the Scala code to create a PostgreSQL database \"sports\" and a table named \"teams\":\n\n```scala\nimport java.sql.{Connection, DriverManager, Statement}\n\nobject DatabaseSetup {\n  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\n    val url = \"jdbc:postgresql://localhost/\"\n    val user = \"your_username\" // replace with your PostgreSQL username\n    val password = \"your_password\" // replace with your PostgreSQL password\n\n    var connection: Connection = null\n    var statement: Statement = null\n\n    try {\n      // Connect to PostgreSQL\n      connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password)\n      statement = connection.createStatement()\n\n      // Create the \"sports\" database\n      statement.executeUpdate(\"CREATE DATABASE sports\")\n\n      // Connect to the \"sports\" database\n      connection.close()\n      connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url + \"sports\", user, password)\n      statement = connection.createStatement()\n\n      // Create the \"teams\" table\n      val createTableQuery =\n        \"\"\"\n          |CREATE TABLE teams (\n          |  team_name VARCHAR(50),\n          |  win_count INTEGER,\n          |  loss_count INTEGER\n          |)\n          |\"\"\".stripMargin\n      statement.executeUpdate(createTableQuery)\n\n      println(\"Database and table created successfully.\")\n\n    } catch {\n      case e: Exception => e.printStackTrace()\n    } finally {\n      if (statement != null) statement.close()\n      if (connection != null) connection.close()\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 2: Insert Data into the \"teams\" Table\n\nHere's the Scala code to insert data for three sports teams:\n\n```scala\nobject InsertData {\n  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\n    val url = \"jdbc:postgresql://localhost/sports\"\n    val user = \"your_username\"\n    val password = \"your_password\"\n\n    var connection: Connection = null\n    var statement: Statement = null\n\n    try {\n      // Connect to the \"sports\" database\n      connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password)\n      statement = connection.createStatement()\n\n      // Insert data into the \"teams\" table\n      val insertDataQuery =\n        \"\"\"\n          |INSERT INTO teams (team_name, win_count, loss_count) VALUES\n          |('Team A', 10, 5),\n          |('Team B', 8, 7),\n          |('Team C', 12, 3)\n          |\"\"\".stripMargin\n      statement.executeUpdate(insertDataQuery)\n\n      println(\"Data inserted successfully.\")\n\n    } catch {\n      case e: Exception => e.printStackTrace()\n    } finally {\n      if (statement != null) statement.close()\n      if (connection != null) connection.close()\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Retrieve Data in Descending Order of Win Count\n\nHere's the Scala code to retrieve the data from the \"teams\" table in descending order of win count:\n\n```scala\nimport java.sql.ResultSet\n\nobject RetrieveData {\n  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\n    val url = \"jdbc:postgresql://localhost/sports\"\n    val user = \"your_username\"\n    val password = \"your_password\"\n\n    var connection: Connection = null\n    var statement: Statement = null\n\n    try {\n      // Connect to the \"sports\" database\n      connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password)\n      statement = connection.createStatement()\n\n      // Retrieve data from the \"teams\" table\n      val selectQuery = \"SELECT * FROM teams ORDER BY win_count DESC\"\n      val resultSet: ResultSet = statement.executeQuery(selectQuery)\n\n      println(\"Teams ordered by win count (descending):\")\n      while (resultSet.next()) {\n        val teamName = resultSet.getString(\"team_name\")\n        val winCount = resultSet.getInt(\"win_count\")\n        val lossCount = resultSet.getInt(\"loss_count\")\n        println(s\"Team: $teamName, Wins: $winCount, Losses: $lossCount\")\n      }\n\n    } catch {\n      case e: Exception => e.printStackTrace()\n    } finally {\n      if (statement != null) statement.close()\n      if (connection != null) connection.close()\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Note\n- Replace `your_username` and `your_password` with your actual PostgreSQL username and password.\n- Make sure the PostgreSQL server is running and accessible.\n- Ensure the PostgreSQL JDBC driver is included in your project's classpath.\n\nThis example uses JDBC for simplicity. For more advanced database operations, consider using Slick or other ORM frameworks."
