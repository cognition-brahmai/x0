        "content": "You can generate a matrix of random numbers in Python using various libraries, one of the most common being NumPy. Here's a simple example of how to do it using NumPy:\n\nFirst, you'll need to install NumPy if you haven't already. You can do this using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install numpy\n```\n\nThen, you can use the following code to generate a matrix of random numbers:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the dimensions of the matrix\nrows = 3\ncols = 4\n\n# Generate a matrix of random numbers between 0 and 1\nrandom_matrix = np.random.rand(rows, cols)\n\nprint(\"Random Matrix:\")\nprint(random_matrix)\n```\n\nIf you want to generate random integers, you can use `np.random.randint` instead. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the dimensions of the matrix\nrows = 3\ncols = 4\n\n# Define the range for random integers\nlow = 1\nhigh = 10\n\n# Generate a matrix of random integers between low (inclusive) and high (exclusive)\nrandom_matrix = np.random.randint(low, high, size=(rows, cols))\n\nprint(\"Random Integer Matrix:\")\nprint(random_matrix)\n```\n\nThese examples generate a 3x4 matrix, but you can adjust the `rows` and `cols` variables to create a matrix of any size you need."
