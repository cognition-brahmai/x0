For instance, when I try to access a non-existent key in a dictionary, I can use the get method to avoid a KeyError and provide a default value. However, when I try to access an index that doesn't exist in a list, I receive an IndexError. Is there a way around this?\n\nHere is an example of what I'm trying to do:\n\n```python\n>>> d = {'a':'b'}\n>>> d['a']\n'b'\n>>> d['c']\nKeyError: 'c'\n>>> d.get('c', 'fail')\n'fail'\n\n>>> l = [1]\n>>> l[10]\nIndexError: list index out of range\n```"

        "content": "Python's list and dictionary data structures serve different purposes and are optimized for different kinds of operations. Lists are sequential collections of items and are accessed by integer indices, while dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs and are accessed by keys. The `get` method in dictionaries is particularly useful for handling missing keys gracefully, but lists don't have an equivalent built-in method because lists are expected to be used with valid indices.\n\nHowever, you can create a similar functionality for lists by defining a custom function to safely access list elements. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef safe_get(lst, index, default=None):\n    try:\n        return lst[index]\n    except IndexError:\n        return default\n\n# Example usage\nl = [1]\nprint(safe_get(l, 10, 'fail'))  # Output: 'fail'\n```\n\nThis `safe_get` function attempts to access the list element at the specified index and returns a default value if an `IndexError` is encountered. You can specify any default value you want, or leave it as `None`. This approach allows you to handle out-of-range index access similarly to how you would handle missing keys in a dictionary."
