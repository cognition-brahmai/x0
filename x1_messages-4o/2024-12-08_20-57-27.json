Below is a Ruby script that demonstrates how to achieve this:\n\n1. **Install the `tone_analyzer` gem** (if you haven't already):\n\n   ```bash\n   gem install tone_analyzer\n   ```\n\n2. **Ruby Code to Analyze Tone**:\n\n   ```ruby\n   require 'tone_analyzer'\n\n   # Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key\n   api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'\n\n   # Initialize ToneAnalyzer with your API key\n   tone_analyzer = ToneAnalyzer::Client.new(api_key: api_key)\n\n   # Input text to be analyzed\n   input_text = \"This task is pointless and completely unnecessary.\"\n\n   # Analyze the tone of the input text\n   response = tone_analyzer.analyze_tone(text: input_text)\n\n   # Extract and print the tone\n   if response && response['document_tone'] && response['document_tone']['tones']\n     tones = response['document_tone']['tones']\n     if tones.empty?\n       puts \"Tone: Neutral\"\n     else\n       tones.each do |tone|\n         puts \"Tone: #{tone['tone_name']} (Score: #{tone['score']})\"\n       end\n     end\n   else\n     puts \"Unable to determine tone.\"\n   end\n   ```\n\n**Key Points to Note:**\n\n- Make sure to replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual API key for the `tone_analyzer` service.\n- The code initializes a `ToneAnalyzer::Client` with the provided API key and analyzes the tone of the input text.\n- The response is checked for tones, and the result is printed to the console.\n- If no specific tone is detected, it defaults to \"Neutral.\"\n\nThis script will help you determine whether the tone of the input is positive, negative, or neutral based on the analysis provided by the `tone_analyzer` gem."
