However, I am only able to get an 'object' type instead of unicode strings. I've tried coercing the UTF-8 data into unicode using Pandas but it's not working as expected. Here is what I've tried:\n\n```python\n# file 1459966468_324.csv\n#1459966468_324.csv: UTF-8 Unicode English text\ndf = pd.read_csv('1459966468_324.csv', dtype={'text': unicode})\ndf.dtypes\n#Output:\ntext               object\nAirline            object\nname               object\nretweet_count     float64\nsentiment          object\ntweet_location     object\ndtype: object\n```\nAnd\n```python\ndf = pd.read_csv('1459966468_324.csv', encoding = 'utf8')\ndf.apply(lambda x: pd.lib.infer_dtype(x.values))\n```\nThe text file can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/l1x/nlp/master/1459966468_324.csv). What is the correct method to read and coerce UTF-8 data into unicode with Pandas?"

        "content": "When you read a CSV file with Pandas, the default behavior is to load text data as strings (which are of type 'object' in Pandas). In Python 3, strings are already unicode, so you don't need to explicitly convert them to unicode.\n\nHowever, if you're looking to ensure that the data is properly read and encoded, you can use the `encoding` parameter in `pd.read_csv`. Additionally, to make sure that the text data is treated as strings, you can also specify `dtype` as `str` for the relevant columns.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read the CSV file with UTF-8 encoding\ndf = pd.read_csv('1459966468_324.csv', encoding='utf-8', dtype=str)\n\n# Check the data types of the columns\nprint(df.dtypes)\n\n# Verify the content of the 'text' column\nprint(df['text'].head())\n```\n\nIn this example, specifying `dtype=str` ensures that the data in the 'text' column (and any other columns you wish to specify) is treated as strings, which are unicode in Python 3. As a result, you should see the correct unicode representation for the text data.\n\nIf you encounter any specific issues with certain characters, you might want to check the data for any encoding-related problems or consider using a different encoding (like `latin1` or `ISO-8859-1`) if you suspect any non-UTF-8 characters."
