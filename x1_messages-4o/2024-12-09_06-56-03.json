I am encountering an issue with the print statement where I want to print an integer, a string, and another integer respectively. Here is what I have so far:\n```python\nfor key in word:\n    i = 1\n    if i < 6:\n        print ( \"%s. %s appears %s times.\") % (str(i), key, str(wordBank[key]))\n```\nThe code above is not printing the variables correctly. How can I alter my print statement so that it works as expected?"

        "content": "In Python 3, the `print` statement has been replaced with the `print()` function, which requires the arguments to be enclosed in parentheses. Additionally, when using string formatting with the `%` operator, you need to make sure that the entire formatted string is within the `print()` function call. \n\nHere's how you can modify your code to work correctly in Python 3:\n\n```python\nfor key in word:\n    i = 1\n    if i < 6:\n        print(\"%s. %s appears %s times.\" % (str(i), key, str(wordBank[key])))\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the newer and more preferred `str.format()` method or f-strings (if you were using Python 3.6 or later) for string formatting, which can make the code more readable:\n\nUsing `str.format()`:\n```python\nfor key in word:\n    i = 1\n    if i < 6:\n        print(\"{}. {} appears {} times.\".format(i, key, wordBank[key]))\n```\n\nUsing f-strings (Python 3.6+):\n```python\nfor key in word:\n    i = 1\n    if i < 6:\n        print(f\"{i}. {key} appears {wordBank[key]} times.\")\n```\n\nBoth of these methods are more modern and often easier to read and maintain than using the `%` operator for string formatting."
