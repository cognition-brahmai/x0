How can I resolve these false errors?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The \"Undefined variable from import\" error you're encountering in Eclipse with PyDev is likely due to the way PyDev performs static analysis on your code. PyDev tries to determine the structure and types of your code without actually running it. When you dynamically add attributes to objects, as you're doing with `settings.main`, PyDev may not be able to infer this correctly, leading to false positives in its error checking.\n\nHere are a few strategies to resolve or suppress these errors:\n\n1. **Explicit Attribute Declaration**: If possible, declare all the expected attributes in your `settings` object upfront. This could be done with placeholder values or `None`. This gives PyDev the hint it needs about the structure of `settings`.\n\n   ```python\n   class Settings:\n       main = None\n\n   settings = Settings()\n   ```\n\n2. **Use a Type Hint**: If you're using Python 3.5 or newer, you can use type hints to help PyDev understand the structure of your code. Define a class for your settings and use it as a type hint.\n\n   ```python\n   class Settings:\n       main: object\n\n   settings = Settings()\n   ```\n\n3. **Suppress Specific Warnings**: If these false positives are not critical, you can suppress specific warnings in PyDev. Go to **Window > Preferences > PyDev > Editor > Code Analysis** and adjust the settings to ignore specific warnings.\n\n4. **Add a `# noqa` Comment**: You can suppress these warnings on a case-by-case basis by adding a `# noqa` comment to the line where the error is reported. Note that this requires using the Flake8 tool, which PyDev can integrate with.\n\n   ```python\n   print(settings.main)  # noqa\n   ```\n\n5. **Reconfigure PyDev**: Sometimes, PyDev's internal caches might be causing issues. Try refreshing or rebuilding your PyDev project:\n\n   - Right-click on the project in the Project Explorer.\n   - Select **PyDev > Remove Error Markers**.\n   - Then, right-click again and choose **Refresh**.\n\n6. **Update PyDev**: Ensure you're using the latest version of PyDev. Bug fixes and improvements are regularly made, which might resolve your issue.\n\n7. **Custom PyLint Configuration**: If you are using a custom PyLint configuration, ensure it's not causing the issue. Modify the PyLint configuration to ignore specific warnings related to dynamic attributes.\n\nIf none of these options work and the problem persists, it might be worth considering whether the dynamic attribute assignment is necessary or if there's a more static way to structure your code to avoid such issues."
