The Celery documentation suggests it's not a good idea to have tasks wait on the results of other tasks. However, I'm not satisfied with the suggested solution as there's no clear way of getting the subtask's result back to the caller. Is there any way to chain jobs to achieve this? For example, using the `add` method:\n\n```python\n>>> add3 = add.subtask(args=(3, ))\n>>> add.delay(1, 2, callback=add3).get()\n6\n```\n\nAlternatively, would it be appropriate to return instances of Result, like this:\n\n```python\n@task\ndef add(x, y, callback=None):\n    result = x + y\n    if callback:\n        return subtask(callback).delay(result)\n    return result\n```\n\nAnd then retrieve the result of the final job in the chain like this:\n\n```python\nresult = add(1, 2, callback=add3).delay()\nwhile isinstance(result, Result):\n    result = result.get()\nprint \"result:\", result\n```"

        "content": "To achieve chaining tasks in Celery where the caller gets the result of the final job, you can use Celery's built-in `chain` or `signature` functionalities. These tools allow you to create a sequence of tasks where the output of one task becomes the input to the next. Using these constructs can help you manage task dependencies more cleanly without having to manually handle Result instances.\n\n### Using `chain`\n\nHere's how you can achieve this using Celery's `chain`:\n\n```python\nfrom celery import Celery, chain\n\napp = Celery('tasks', broker='pyamqp://guest@localhost//')\n\n@app.task\ndef add(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\n@app.task\ndef multiply(result, z):\n    return result * z\n\n# Chain tasks together\nresult = chain(add.s(1, 2), multiply.s(3))()\n\n# Retrieve the final result\nfinal_result = result.get(timeout=10)\nprint(\"Final result:\", final_result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Defining Tasks**: You define your tasks using the `@app.task` decorator. In this example, `add` and `multiply` are simple tasks that perform arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Chaining Tasks**: Use `chain()` to create a sequence of tasks. `add.s(1, 2)` creates a signature for the `add` task with arguments `1` and `2`. The result of this task is passed as the first argument to the next task in the chain, `multiply.s(3)`, which multiplies the result by `3`.\n\n3. **Executing the Chain**: Call the chain with `()`, which will execute the tasks in sequence. The result is a Celery `AsyncResult` object.\n\n4. **Getting the Final Result**: Use `result.get()` to retrieve the final result of the task chain. You can specify a `timeout` to avoid waiting indefinitely.\n\n### Using `signature`\n\nAlternatively, you could use task signatures directly to achieve a similar result:\n\n```python\nfrom celery import Celery, signature\n\napp = Celery('tasks', broker='pyamqp://guest@localhost//')\n\n@app.task\ndef add(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\n@app.task\ndef multiply(result, z):\n    return result * z\n\n# Create task signatures\nadd_signature = add.s(1, 2)\nmultiply_signature = multiply.s(3)\n\n# Chain using signatures\nresult = (add_signature | multiply_signature)()\n\n# Retrieve the final result\nfinal_result = result.get(timeout=10)\nprint(\"Final result:\", final_result)\n```\n\nIn both examples, the caller gets the final result of the chain. This method ensures that each task in the sequence waits for the previous task to complete and pass its result to the next task. This allows you to construct complex workflows without manually managing intermediate results."
