However, when I try to catch and re-raise an exception, I lose the original traceback, making it difficult for me to identify where the exception is coming from. How can I preserve the original traceback and re-raise it? Here is my code and the current traceback:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef func1():\n    func2()\n\ndef func2():\n    raise Exception('test error')\n\ndef main():\n    err = None\n\n    try:\n        func1()\n    except:\n        err = sys.exc_info()[1]\n        pass\n\n    # some extra processing, involving checking err details (if err is not None)\n\n    # need to re-raise err so caller can do its own handling\n    if err:\n        raise err\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\nCurrent traceback:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"err_test.py\", line 25, in <module>\n    main()\n  File \"err_test.py\", line 22, in main\n    raise err\nException: test error\n```"

        "content": "To preserve the original traceback when re-raising an exception in Python, you can use the `raise` statement without specifying an exception, or use the `from` keyword with `raise` to chain exceptions. In your case, you can modify the `main` function to use the `raise` statement without arguments, which will re-raise the last exception caught with its original traceback. \n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef func1():\n    func2()\n\ndef func2():\n    raise Exception('test error')\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        func1()\n    except Exception as err:\n        # some extra processing, involving checking err details (if err is not None)\n        \n        # re-raise the exception with its original traceback\n        raise\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\nWith this modification, when you catch an exception and want to re-raise it, you simply use `raise` without an argument. This will ensure that the original traceback is preserved, making it easier to identify where the exception originated.\n\nIf you need to perform some operations after catching the exception and still want to keep the original traceback, you can use `raise` without arguments at the end of your `except` block, as shown above. This way, the traceback won't be lost."
