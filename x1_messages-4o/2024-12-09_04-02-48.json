Is there an equivalent function in Python for multidimensional ranges, such that range((3,2)) would return [(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1),(2,0),(2,1)]? I am trying to loop through the tiles of a rectangular area on a tile-based game using a for loop as follows:\n\n```python\nfor x,y in range((3,2)):\n```\n\nI am not seeking a custom implementation. I want to know if Python or its standard/common libraries have a built-in function for this purpose."

        "content": "Python's standard library does not have a built-in function specifically designed for generating multidimensional ranges in the same way that `range()` does for one-dimensional ranges. However, a common approach to achieve this is to use the `itertools.product` function from the `itertools` module, which creates a Cartesian product of input iterables. This can simulate a multidimensional range.\n\nHere's how you can use `itertools.product` to achieve the desired effect:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\nfor x, y in product(range(3), range(2)):\n    print((x, y))\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n(0, 0)\n(0, 1)\n(1, 0)\n(1, 1)\n(2, 0)\n(2, 1)\n```\n\nThe `itertools.product` function takes multiple iterables as arguments and returns an iterator that yields tuples of all possible combinations, equivalent to the nested loops you would write manually. In this case, `range(3)` and `range(2)` represent the dimensions of the rectangular area."
