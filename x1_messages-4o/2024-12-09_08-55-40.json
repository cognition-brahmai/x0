        "content": "To round a number to the nearest hundredth decimal place in JavaScript, you can create a function that uses the `Math.round()` method in combination with some simple arithmetic. Here's a step-by-step guide and the function:\n\n1. **Multiply the number by 100**: This shifts the decimal two places to the right, effectively converting the hundredth place to a whole number. \n\n2. **Use `Math.round()`**: This method rounds the number to the nearest integer.\n\n3. **Divide by 100**: This shifts the decimal back to its original place.\n\nHere's the JavaScript function that implements these steps:\n\n```javascript\nfunction roundToHundredth(number) {\n    return Math.round(number * 100) / 100;\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst roundedNumber = roundToHundredth(5.6789);\nconsole.log(roundedNumber); // Output: 5.68\n```\n\nThis function works by first scaling the number so that the hundredth's place becomes the unit's place, rounds it, and then scales it back down to its original position. This effectively rounds the number to the nearest hundredth."
