The warning message is \"Using the global statement.\" I am trying to understand why this warning is generated. Is there a more Pythonic way to modify immutable, module-wide variables inside a function? Would it be advisable to encapsulate them in mutable structures like dictionaries, or should I consider converting the entire module into a class? Additionally, I believe this warning should not be shown when the variable is considered \"private\" (prefixed with _ or __). Could you provide some insights on this?"

        "content": "The Pylint warning W0603, \"Using the global statement,\" is generated to encourage better design practices in Python code. The use of the `global` statement can make code harder to understand and maintain because it allows functions to modify variables defined outside their scope, which can lead to unexpected side effects and make the flow of data less clear.\n\nHere are some insights and alternative approaches to consider:\n\n1. **Encapsulating in a Class**: If your module has a collection of related global variables, turning the module into a class can be a good approach. This allows you to use instance variables instead of global ones, providing better encapsulation and allowing you to manage state more effectively.\n\n2. **Using Mutable Structures**: If you only need to modify a few variables, you can encapsulate them within a mutable structure like a dictionary or a list. This way, you can pass the structure around and modify its contents without using the `global` statement. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   config = {'value': 42}\n\n   def update_value(new_value):\n       config['value'] = new_value\n   ```\n\n3. **Refactoring Code Structure**: Sometimes, the need for globals indicates that the code can be refactored into a different structure, such as passing variables as arguments to functions or returning new values.\n\n4. **Singletons or Module-Level Attributes**: You can also use a singleton pattern or module-level attributes to manage the state. This can be done by creating a separate module to manage the state and importing it where needed.\n\n5. **Private Variables**: While prefixing a variable with an underscore (e.g., `_variable`) is a convention to indicate that a variable is intended for internal use, it doesn't affect the behavior of the `global` statement or suppress Pylint warnings. The warning is more about the practice of using globals rather than their naming.\n\nUltimately, the choice of approach depends on the complexity and architectural needs of your application. If the use of global variables is limited and well-documented, it might be acceptable, but in general, refactoring to reduce reliance on global state is considered more Pythonic and leads to more maintainable code."
