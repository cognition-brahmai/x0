        "content": "Yes, you can read specific lines from a file using their line numbers in Python. You can achieve this by using a for loop to iterate over the file and a simple condition to check if the current line number matches the ones you're interested in. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef read_specific_lines(file_path, line_numbers):\n    specific_lines = []\n    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n        for current_line_number, line in enumerate(file, start=1):\n            if current_line_number in line_numbers:\n                specific_lines.append(line.strip())\n    return specific_lines\n\n# Example usage\nfile_path = 'your_file.txt'\nlines_to_read = [26, 30]\nlines = read_specific_lines(file_path, lines_to_read)\n\nfor line_number, content in zip(lines_to_read, lines):\n    print(f\"Line {line_number}: {content}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The `enumerate` function is used to keep track of the current line number as you iterate through the file.\n- The `start=1` parameter in `enumerate` ensures that line numbering starts at 1, which is typical for line numbers.\n- The `if current_line_number in line_numbers` condition checks if the current line number is one of the specified line numbers you want to read.\n- `line.strip()` is used to remove any leading or trailing whitespace characters, including the newline character at the end of each line.\n\nMake sure to replace `'your_file.txt'` with the actual path to your file. This script will print the content of the specified lines, in this case, lines 26 and 30."
