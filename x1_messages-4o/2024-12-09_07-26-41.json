I was under the impression that higher Chi2 scores indicate that the feature is more independent and thus less useful to the model, meaning we should be interested in features with the lowest scores. However, when I use Scikit-learn's SelectKBest, it returns the features with the highest Chi2 scores. Is my understanding of the Chi2 test incorrect? Or does Scikit-learn's Chi2 score produce something other than a Chi2 statistic? I've included the code I used below:\n\n```\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import chi2\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load iris data\niris = load_iris()\n\n# Create features and target\nX = iris.data\ny = iris.target\n\n# Convert to categorical data by converting data to integers\nX = X.astype(int)\n\n# Select two features with highest chi-squared statistics\nchi2_selector = SelectKBest(chi2, k=2)\nchi2_selector.fit(X, y)\n\n# Look at scores returned from the selector for each feature\nchi2_scores = pd.DataFrame(list(zip(iris.feature_names, chi2_selector.scores_, chi2_selector.pvalues_)), columns=['ftr', 'score', 'pval'])\nchi2_scores\n\n# you can see that the kbest returned from SelectKBest \n#+ were the two features with the _highest_ score\nkbest = np.asarray(iris.feature_names)[chi2_selector.get_support()]\nkbest\n```"

        "content": "Your understanding of the Chi-squared (Chi2) test in the context of feature selection needs a bit of clarification. The Chi-squared test is a statistical test used to determine the independence of two categorical variables. When applied to feature selection, it evaluates whether there is a significant relationship between the feature and the target.\n\nHere\u2019s the key point: \n\n- **Higher Chi2 Scores Indicate Dependence**: A higher Chi2 score suggests that the feature is more dependent on the target variable, meaning that it is more likely to be informative for predicting the target. Therefore, features with higher Chi2 scores are considered more useful for the model.\n\n- **SelectKBest with Chi2**: When you use `SelectKBest` with the `chi2` function in Scikit-learn, it indeed selects the features with the highest Chi2 scores. This is because these features are deemed statistically more significant in terms of their relationship with the target variable.\n\nIn your code, `SelectKBest` is correctly selecting the features with the highest Chi2 scores because those features are more likely to contribute useful information for classification. The confusion might arise from thinking that independence (a low Chi2 score) is desirable, whereas in feature selection, you are actually looking for dependence (a high Chi2 score) with the target.\n\nHere's a brief rundown of your code:\n\n1. You load the iris dataset and split it into features `X` and target `y`.\n2. You convert `X` to integer values to fit the requirements of the Chi2 test (it works with categorical data).\n3. `SelectKBest` is used to select the top `k` features based on the Chi2 test.\n4. The scores and p-values are displayed to show the significance of each feature.\n\nYour final selection of `kbest` features is based on which features have the highest Chi2 scores, indicating they have a stronger relationship with the target variable and are therefore more useful for model training."
