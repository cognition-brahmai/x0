The 'ID' column numbers have varying lengths and I would like to add leading zeros to each 'ID' so they all have the same length, preferably 15 digits. I've tried the following code but it doesn't seem to be working: \n\n```python\ndf['ID'] = df.ID.zfill(15)\ndf['ID'] = '{0:0>15}'.format(df['ID'])\n```\n\nHere is my current dataframe:\n\n```python\n         ID        text1    text 2\n0       2345656     blah      blah\n1          3456     blah      blah\n2        541304     blah      blah        \n3        201306       hi      blah        \n4   12313201308    hello      blah\n```\n\nAnd this is what I want to achieve:\n\n```python\n                ID    text1    text 2\n0  000000002345656     blah      blah\n1  000000000003456     blah      blah\n2  000000000541304     blah      blah        \n3  000000000201306       hi      blah        \n4  000012313201308    hello      blah \n```\n\nCould you help me solve this problem?"

        "content": "Certainly! The issue with your current code is that `zfill` and `format` are not being applied correctly because they are designed for string objects, whereas you're trying to apply them to a pandas Series. You need to ensure the `ID` column is treated as a string before applying these methods.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can achieve your desired output:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'ID': [2345656, 3456, 541304, 201306, 12313201308],\n    'text1': ['blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'hi', 'hello'],\n    'text2': ['blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah']\n}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Convert the 'ID' column to string and pad with leading zeros\ndf['ID'] = df['ID'].astype(str).str.zfill(15)\n\n# Display the updated DataFrame\nprint(df)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`astype(str)`**: This converts the `ID` column to a string type, which is necessary for string operations.\n- **`str.zfill(15)`**: This method pads the string with leading zeros until the length of the string is 15 characters.\n\nThis approach should give you the desired DataFrame with all `ID` numbers padded with leading zeros to a total length of 15 characters."
