        "content": "Sure! Here's a simple Java program that implements a basic calculator, capable of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class BasicCalculator {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Basic Calculator\");\n        System.out.println(\"Choose an operation: +, -, *, /\");\n        char operation = scanner.next().charAt(0);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Enter the first number:\");\n        double num1 = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        System.out.println(\"Enter the second number:\");\n        double num2 = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        double result;\n\n        switch (operation) {\n            case '+':\n                result = num1 + num2;\n                System.out.println(\"The result is: \" + result);\n                break;\n            case '-':\n                result = num1 - num2;\n                System.out.println(\"The result is: \" + result);\n                break;\n            case '*':\n                result = num1 * num2;\n                System.out.println(\"The result is: \" + result);\n                break;\n            case '/':\n                if (num2 != 0) {\n                    result = num1 / num2;\n                    System.out.println(\"The result is: \" + result);\n                } else {\n                    System.out.println(\"Error! Division by zero is not allowed.\");\n                }\n                break;\n            default:\n                System.out.println(\"Invalid operation.\");\n                break;\n        }\n\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### How it works:\n1. The program prompts the user to select an operation (+, -, *, /).\n2. It then asks for two numbers on which the operation will be performed.\n3. Based on the chosen operation, it performs the calculation and displays the result.\n4. It includes error handling for division by zero.\n\nThis basic calculator is operated via the console and handles basic arithmetic operations."
