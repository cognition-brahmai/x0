        "content": "The C# code you provided is a great start for solving the problem. Here\u2019s a brief explanation of what each part does:\n\n1. **Finding the number with the greatest absolute value:**\n   - `numbers.Max(n => Math.Abs(n))` uses a lambda expression to apply the `Math.Abs` function to each element in `numbers`, and `Max` then finds the largest value among those absolute values.\n\n2. **Calculating the sum of all numbers:**\n   - `numbers.Sum()` computes the sum of all the elements in the array.\n\n3. **Counting the number of even numbers:**\n   - `numbers.Count(n => n % 2 == 0)` counts the elements in the array that are even by checking if the remainder when divided by 2 is zero.\n\nPutting it all together, the C# code efficiently calculates the desired values. Here\u2019s the complete code:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Linq;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        int[] numbers = { 5, 11, 87, 32 };\n        \n        // Find the number with the greatest absolute value\n        int maxAbsValue = numbers.Max(n => Math.Abs(n));\n        \n        // Calculate the sum of all numbers\n        int sum = numbers.Sum();\n        \n        // Count the even numbers\n        int evenCount = numbers.Count(n => n % 2 == 0);\n        \n        // Output the results\n        Console.WriteLine(\"The number with the greatest absolute value is {0}. The sum of all the numbers is {1}. There are {2} even numbers in the set.\", maxAbsValue, sum, evenCount);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will print:\n\n```\nThe number with the greatest absolute value is 87. The sum of all the numbers is 135. There are 2 even numbers in the set.\n```\n\nThis output indicates that 87 has the greatest absolute value, the sum of numbers is 135, and there are 2 even numbers (32 and 5) in the set."
