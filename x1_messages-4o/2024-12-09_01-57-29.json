I am currently using it to put data validation on all rows that contain \"Default\", but for this, I need to know the total number of rows. I understand that this is achievable when using Iterable workbook mode, but I am adding a new sheet to the workbook which isn't possible in this mode."

        "content": "To find the last row in a column using `openpyxl`, you can iterate through the column values and identify the last non-empty cell. Since you want to add a new sheet as well, you should work with the workbook in normal mode, not in `read_only` mode. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Open the workbook in normal mode.\n2. Access the desired sheet.\n3. Iterate through the rows to find the last non-empty row in the specified column.\n4. Add a new sheet and perform your operations.\n\nHere's a sample code snippet demonstrating these steps:\n\n```python\nfrom openpyxl import load_workbook\n\n# Load the workbook\nwb = load_workbook('your_workbook.xlsx')\n\n# Select the worksheet you are working with\nws = wb['YourSheetName']\n\n# Specify the column you want to check (e.g., column 'A')\ncolumn_letter = 'A'\n\n# Initialize a variable to keep track of the last non-empty row\nlast_row = 0\n\n# Iterate through the rows in the specified column\nfor row in range(1, ws.max_row + 1):\n    cell_value = ws[f'{column_letter}{row}'].value\n    if cell_value is not None:\n        last_row = row\n\n# Now you have the last non-empty row in the specified column\nprint(f\"The last non-empty row in column {column_letter} is {last_row}.\")\n\n# Add a new sheet if needed\nws_new = wb.create_sheet(title='NewSheetName')\n\n# Save the workbook after making changes\nwb.save('your_workbook.xlsx')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `load_workbook('your_workbook.xlsx')`: Loads the existing workbook.\n- `ws = wb['YourSheetName']`: Accesses the specific worksheet you are working with.\n- `for row in range(1, ws.max_row + 1)`: Iterates over all rows in the specified column.\n- `ws[f'{column_letter}{row}'].value`: Gets the value of each cell in the column.\n- `last_row = row`: Updates the last non-empty row number.\n- `wb.create_sheet(title='NewSheetName')`: Adds a new sheet to the workbook.\n- `wb.save('your_workbook.xlsx')`: Saves the workbook with the changes.\n\nThis approach allows you to find the last row in a column and make any necessary modifications to the workbook, including adding new sheets and applying data validation as needed."
