        "content": "The error you're encountering usually occurs when the PyYAML library is not updated to a version that includes `FullLoader`. The `FullLoader` was introduced in PyYAML 5.1 to provide a more secure way of loading YAML files compared to the default loader.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Upgrade PyYAML**: Ensure that you have the latest version of PyYAML installed. You can upgrade PyYAML using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade pyyaml\n   ```\n\n2. **Check PyYAML Version**: After upgrading, verify the installed version of PyYAML to ensure it's 5.1 or later:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -c \"import yaml; print(yaml.__version__)\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Use an Alternative Loader**: If for some reason you cannot upgrade PyYAML, you can use the `SafeLoader` instead of `FullLoader`. `SafeLoader` is a more secure alternative to the default loader, although it might not support all YAML features:\n\n   ```python\n   import yaml\n\n   with open('your_file.yaml', 'r') as fp:\n       config = yaml.load(fp, Loader=yaml.SafeLoader)\n   ```\n\n4. **Consider Alternative Libraries**: If you encounter persistent issues with PyYAML, you might consider using another YAML parsing library like `ruyaml` which is often more compliant and feature-rich.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `AttributeError` and successfully load your YAML file."
