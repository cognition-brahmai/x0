One relationship is for the owner of the post and the other for the last editor of the post. They can be different values but both refer to the same User table. However, I am encountering an error that states \"sqlalchemy.exc.ArgumentError: Error creating backref 'posts' on relationship 'Post.owner': property of that name exists on mapper 'Mapper|User|users'\". How can I correct this error and maintain both foreign keys in the Post model? Here is my current model setup:\n\n```\nclass Post(Base):\n    last_editor_id = Column(BigInteger, ForeignKey('users.id'), nullable=True)\n    last_editor = relationship('User', backref='posts', foreign_keys=[last_editor_id])\n    owner_id = Column(BigInteger, ForeignKey('users.id'), nullable=False, index=True)\n    owner = relationship('User', backref='posts', foreign_keys=[owner_id])\n\nclass User(Base):\n    '''This represents a user on the site'''\n    __tablename__ = 'users'\n    id = Column(BigInteger, primary_key=True, unique=True)\n    name = Column(BigInteger, nullable=False)\n```"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you are encountering is due to the use of the same `backref` name (\"posts\") for both the `owner` and `last_editor` relationships. When you specify a `backref`, SQLAlchemy automatically creates a reverse relationship from the `User` model to the `Post` model with the name specified in the `backref`. Since you are using the same name for both relationships, SQLAlchemy is trying to create two properties named \"posts\" on the `User` model, which leads to the conflict.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to use different `backref` names for each relationship. Here is how you can modify your model setup:\n\n```python\nclass Post(Base):\n    last_editor_id = Column(BigInteger, ForeignKey('users.id'), nullable=True)\n    last_editor = relationship('User', backref='edited_posts', foreign_keys=[last_editor_id])\n    owner_id = Column(BigInteger, ForeignKey('users.id'), nullable=False, index=True)\n    owner = relationship('User', backref='owned_posts', foreign_keys=[owner_id])\n\nclass User(Base):\n    '''This represents a user on the site'''\n    __tablename__ = 'users'\n    id = Column(BigInteger, primary_key=True, unique=True)\n    name = Column(BigInteger, nullable=False)\n```\n\nIn this modification:\n- The `backref` for the `last_editor` relationship is changed to `edited_posts`.\n- The `backref` for the `owner` relationship is changed to `owned_posts`.\n\nThis ensures that there are no naming conflicts on the `User` model, and you can access a user's edited posts and owned posts separately using `user.edited_posts` and `user.owned_posts`, respectively."
