The string I have is \"{1, {2, 3}} {4, 5}\" and I want to extract \"1, {2, 3}\" and \"4, 5\". I tried using the following expressions but I'm encountering an error which states \"too much backtracking\". Is it possible to extract match objects for the outer parenthesis using regex's recursion?\n\n<pre><code>\nregex.findall(r\"{(:[^{}]*|?R)}\", \"{1, {2, 3}} {4, 5}\")\nregex.findall(r\"({(:[^{}]*|?R)})\", \"{1, {2, 3}} {4, 5}\")\nregex.findall(r\"({(:.*|(?R))*})\", \"{1, {2, 3}} {4, 5}\")\nregex.findall(r\"({(:.*)|(?R)*})\", \"{1, {2, 3}} {4, 5}\")\nregex.findall(r\"({(:[^{}])|(?R)})\", \"{1, {2, 3}} {4, 5}\")\n</code></pre>"

        "content": "To match balanced braces using regex in Python, you can use the `regex` module, which supports recursive patterns. The `re` module doesn't support recursion, so make sure you are using the `regex` module (`pip install regex`). Here's how you can achieve what you want:\n\n```python\nimport regex\n\npattern = r\"\"\"\n    \\{\n    (?:  # non-capturing group\n        [^{}]++  # match non-brace characters without backtracking\n        |  # or\n        (?R)  # recursive match of the pattern\n    )*\n    \\}\n\"\"\"\n\n# Using VERBOSE mode for better readability\nmatches = regex.findall(pattern, \"{1, {2, 3}} {4, 5}\", regex.VERBOSE)\n\n# Strip the outer braces from each match if you want just the content\nstripped_matches = [match[1:-1] for match in matches]\n\nprint(stripped_matches)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- `\\{`: Matches an opening brace `{`.\n- `(?: ... )*`: A non-capturing group that matches zero or more of the contained patterns.\n- `[^{}]++`: Matches one or more characters that are not braces. The `++` is a possessive quantifier which prevents backtracking, helping to avoid \"too much backtracking\" errors.\n- `(?R)`: Recursively applies the entire pattern.\n- `\\}`: Matches a closing brace `}`.\n\nThis pattern will correctly handle nested braces by using the recursive pattern `(?R)`. The `VERBOSE` flag is used to allow whitespace and comments in the pattern for better readability.\n\nThe `stripped_matches` list will contain the contents of the outermost braces, which is what you want: `[\"1, {2, 3}\", \"4, 5\"]`."
