Here is my server media URL code: \n\n```python\nfrom django.conf import settings\n(r'^public/(?P<path>.*)$', 'django.views.static.serve',{'document_root': settings.MEDIA_ROOT}),\n```\n\nAnd my function model code:\n\n```python\ndef image_img(self):\n    if self.image:\n        return u'<img src=\"%s\" />' % self.image.url_125x125\n    else:\n        return '(Sin imagen)'\n    image_img.short_description = 'Thumb'\n    image_img.allow_tags = True\n```\n\nIn admin.py:\n\n```python\nclass ImagesAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    list_display= ('image_img','product',)\n```\n\nHowever, the result I get is:\n\n```html\n<img src=\"http://127.0.0.1:8000/public/product_images/6a00d8341c630a53ef0120a556b3b4970c.125x125.jpg\" />\n```\n\nInstead of the image, it is showing the image url. What could be the problem?"

        "content": "To display thumbnail images in the Django admin interface, it seems like you're on the right track, but there are a few things you might want to check and adjust:\n\n1. **Ensure `allow_tags` is set correctly**: Although you have `allow_tags` set, note that in Django 1.9 and later, `allow_tags` is not necessary because `mark_safe` should be used instead to mark strings as safe for HTML output.\n\n2. **Use `mark_safe` to render HTML**: You should use `mark_safe` from `django.utils.safestring` to ensure that the HTML is rendered correctly in the Django admin panel.\n\nHere is an updated version of your `image_img` method using `mark_safe`:\n\n```python\nfrom django.utils.html import mark_safe\n\ndef image_img(self):\n    if self.image:\n        return mark_safe('<img src=\"%s\" width=\"125\" height=\"125\" />' % self.image.url)\n    else:\n        return '(No image)'\n\nimage_img.short_description = 'Thumbnail'\n```\n\n3. **Check your media settings**: Ensure your `MEDIA_URL` and `MEDIA_ROOT` settings are correctly configured in `settings.py`. The `MEDIA_URL` should be the URL that serves the media files, and `MEDIA_ROOT` should be the path to the directory where media files are stored.\n\nHere's an example configuration:\n\n```python\nMEDIA_URL = '/media/'\nMEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')\n```\n\n4. **URL Configuration**: Make sure your URL configuration is correctly set up to serve media files during development (this is not recommended for production). You should have something like this in your `urls.py`:\n\n```python\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.conf.urls.static import static\n\nurlpatterns = [\n    # your url patterns\n] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)\n```\n\n5. **Check image field URL property**: Make sure that `self.image.url` or whatever field you are using correctly points to the image URL. Your example uses `self.image.url_125x125`, which seems to be a custom size, ensure that it\u2019s correct.\n\nAfter making these changes, restart your Django server and check the admin interface again. This should help display the images correctly instead of just showing the URLs."
