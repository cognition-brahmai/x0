Below is an example of an HTML page that includes a 3-column table displaying some programming languages, their features, and benefits:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Programming Languages Features and Benefits</title>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n            margin: 20px;\n        }\n        table {\n            width: 100%;\n            border-collapse: collapse;\n            margin-top: 20px;\n        }\n        th, td {\n            border: 1px solid #ddd;\n            padding: 8px;\n            text-align: left;\n        }\n        th {\n            background-color: #f2f2f2;\n        }\n        tr:hover {\n            background-color: #f1f1f1;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n    <h1>Programming Languages Features and Benefits</h1>\n\n    <table>\n        <thead>\n            <tr>\n                <th>Language</th>\n                <th>Features</th>\n                <th>Benefits</th>\n            </tr>\n        </thead>\n        <tbody>\n            <tr>\n                <td>Python</td>\n                <td>High-level, Interpreted, Dynamic typing</td>\n                <td>Easy to read and write, Large community support, Extensive libraries</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>JavaScript</td>\n                <td>Event-driven, Functional, Asynchronous</td>\n                <td>Versatile for web development, Large ecosystem, Runs in browsers</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>Java</td>\n                <td>Object-oriented, Platform-independent, Robust</td>\n                <td>Write once, run anywhere, Strong memory management, Multi-threading</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>C++</td>\n                <td>Object-oriented, Low-level manipulation, Performance-oriented</td>\n                <td>High performance, Control over system resources, Widely used in game development</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>Ruby</td>\n                <td>Dynamic, Reflective, Object-oriented</td>\n                <td>Focus on simplicity and productivity, Rich ecosystem, Rails framework for web apps</td>\n            </tr>\n        </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **HTML Structure**: The page is structured with a simple HTML document containing a `<head>` section with metadata and styles and a `<body>` section with content.\n- **Styling**: Basic CSS is used to style the table, including borders, padding, and hover effects to enhance readability.\n- **Table**: The table uses `<thead>` for headers and `<tbody>` for the main content, displaying programming languages along with their features and benefits.\n- **Responsiveness**: The page is made responsive using the viewport meta tag, which adjusts the layout on various screen sizes.\n\nYou can copy this code into an HTML file and open it in a web browser to see the table displayed. You can also modify the content as needed to suit your requirements."
