        "content": "The error you're encountering is because `cPickle` is not a standalone package you can install via `pip`. In Python 3, the `cPickle` module has been integrated into the `pickle` module, and you don't need to install it separately. \n\nHere's how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Remove `cPickle` from `requirements.txt`:** Since you don't need to install `cPickle`, you should remove it from your `requirements.txt` file.\n\n2. **Modify Your Code (if needed):** If your code is using `cPickle`, you should replace `cPickle` with `pickle` since the functionality is now part of the `pickle` module in Python 3.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify the import statement in your code:\n\n```python\n# Replace this\nimport cPickle as pickle\n\n# With this\nimport pickle\n```\n\n3. **Rebuild Your Docker Image:** Once you've made these changes, you can rebuild your Docker image without specifying `cPickle` in `requirements.txt`.\n\nRun the following command to rebuild the image:\n\n```bash\ndocker build -t sample .\n```\n\nBy following these steps, your Docker build should proceed without encountering the error related to `cPickle`."
