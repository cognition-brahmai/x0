        "content": "In Python, the `try-except` block is a control flow structure, and unfortunately, Python does not have a built-in way to directly condense `try-except` blocks into a single line like the ternary conditional operator (`x if condition else y`). However, you can achieve a similar effect by using a helper function or a lambda expression to encapsulate the logic. Here's how you can do it using a helper function:\n\n```python\ndef try_except_default(func, default):\n    try:\n        return func()\n    except:\n        return default\n\n# Usage\nvariable = try_except_default(lambda: ... do some file loading stuff ..., \"\")\n```\n\nThis way, you encapsulate the `try-except` logic inside the `try_except_default` function, which takes a callable and a default value. If the callable raises an exception, the function returns the default value.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `contextlib` module to create a context manager that handles exceptions, but that's generally more suited for more complex use cases. For simple expressions, the helper function approach is often the most straightforward way to condense `try-except` logic."
