Additionally, in case of ties, how can the item with the lowest index be returned? For instance, when applying a function like 'most_common' to a list like ['duck', 'duck', 'goose'] the result should be 'duck' and for a list like ['goose', 'duck', 'duck', 'goose'] the result should be 'goose'."

        "content": "To find the most common element in a Python list where the elements are not hashable, you can use a combination of sorting and a linear scan to determine the most frequent element. If there's a tie, this method will naturally return the element that appears first (i.e., the one with the lowest index) because of the way sorting and counting are handled. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\ndef most_common(lst):\n    # Sort the list, which groups identical elements together\n    sorted_list = sorted(lst)\n    \n    # Initialize variables to track the most common element and its count\n    most_common_element = None\n    max_count = 0\n    current_element = None\n    current_count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate over the sorted list to count occurrences\n    for element in sorted_list:\n        if element == current_element:\n            current_count += 1\n        else:\n            # Check if the current element's count is greater than the max count\n            if current_count > max_count:\n                most_common_element = current_element\n                max_count = current_count\n            # Reset current element and count\n            current_element = element\n            current_count = 1\n    \n    # Final check for the last element\n    if current_count > max_count:\n        most_common_element = current_element\n    \n    return most_common_element\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(most_common(['duck', 'duck', 'goose']))  # Output: 'duck'\nprint(most_common(['goose', 'duck', 'duck', 'goose']))  # Output: 'goose'\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Sorting**: By sorting the list, identical elements are grouped together, which makes it easy to count consecutive occurrences.\n\n2. **Linear Scan**: As you iterate over the sorted list, you can count how many times each element appears consecutively.\n\n3. **Tracking Counts**: Keep track of the current element and its count. If the current count exceeds the maximum count seen so far, update the most common element and the maximum count.\n\n4. **Handling Ties**: Since the list is sorted, any tie will naturally be resolved in favor of the element that appears first in the original list.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem without relying on hashable elements or using dictionaries."
