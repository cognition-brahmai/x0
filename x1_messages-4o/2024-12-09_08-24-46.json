My graphics card is a GeForce 845M, and I've verified the gcc version as 7.5. I've installed the correct headers and followed the post-installation instructions. I even compiled and ran the samples successfully. But, when I run a Python snippet to check if CUDA is available, it returns False. I've also tried adding /usr/local/cuda-10.1/bin to etc/environment and restarting the terminal, but it didn't work. The PyTorch version I'm using is 1.5.0 and the CUDA version used to build PyTorch is 10.2. I'm using Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS and Python version 3.6. Can you help me resolve this?"

        "content": "Certainly! Let's troubleshoot the issue step by step to determine why PyTorch isn't recognizing CUDA on your system.\n\n1. **Check CUDA Toolkit Version:**\n   - Confirm that the installed CUDA toolkit version matches the version PyTorch was built with. PyTorch 1.5.0 was built with CUDA 10.2, so make sure that CUDA 10.2 is installed. You can verify the installed CUDA version by running `nvcc --version` in the terminal.\n\n2. **Check NVIDIA Driver:**\n   - Ensure that your NVIDIA drivers are installed and up to date. You can check the driver version by running `nvidia-smi` in the terminal. The GeForce 845M should work with the newer drivers, but older GPUs may require specific driver versions.\n\n3. **Verify CUDA PATH:**\n   - Make sure that your environment paths are set correctly. Check the contents of your `~/.bashrc` file and ensure it contains:\n     ```sh\n     export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-10.2/bin:$PATH\n     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-10.2/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n     ```\n   - After making changes, run `source ~/.bashrc` to apply them.\n\n4. **Check PyTorch Installation:**\n   - It is possible that the installed PyTorch version is for CPU only. Reinstall PyTorch with CUDA support by running:\n     ```sh\n     pip install torch==1.5.0+cu102 torchvision==0.6.0+cu102 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html\n     ```\n\n5. **Check Python Environment:**\n   - Ensure you're using the correct Python environment where PyTorch is installed. If you're using a virtual environment, activate it and run the Python snippet again.\n\n6. **Test CUDA in PyTorch:**\n   - Run the following Python code to check CUDA availability and device properties:\n     ```python\n     import torch\n     print(\"CUDA Available: \", torch.cuda.is_available())\n     print(\"CUDA Device Count: \", torch.cuda.device_count())\n     print(\"CUDA Current Device: \", torch.cuda.current_device())\n     print(\"CUDA Device Name: \", torch.cuda.get_device_name(torch.cuda.current_device()))\n     ```\n\n7. **Check for Errors:**\n   - Look for any error messages or warnings in the terminal output when running your code. This might give more clues about what's going wrong.\n\nIf you've tried all these steps and are still facing issues, there may be compatibility issues between your GPU and the CUDA version. In such cases, you may need to try using a different version of CUDA or PyTorch that aligns better with your hardware."
