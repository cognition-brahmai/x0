        "content": "In Python, defining a function inside another function is perfectly valid and sometimes beneficial. However, whether you should do it depends on your specific use case and coding style preferences. Here are some considerations to help you decide:\n\n### When to Define a Function Inside Another:\n\n1. **Encapsulation**: If `method_b` is genuinely only useful within `method_a` and is not intended to be reused elsewhere, defining it inside `method_a` can encapsulate it. This can make the code easier to understand by indicating that `method_b` is not intended to be used outside of `method_a`.\n\n2. **Scoping**: Defining `method_b` inside `method_a` limits its scope to `method_a`. This can prevent namespace pollution and accidental use of `method_b` elsewhere in your code.\n\n3. **Readability**: For a short function that is only relevant to the logic of `method_a`, it can make the code more readable by keeping related functionality together.\n\n### When to Avoid Defining a Function Inside Another:\n\n1. **Reusability**: If there's a chance you might want to use `method_b` elsewhere in your code in the future, it should be defined at the module level.\n\n2. **Testing**: Functions defined within other functions can be more challenging to test individually. If testing `method_b` independently from `method_a` is important, it may be better to keep them separate.\n\n3. **Complexity**: If `method_b` is complex or lengthy, defining it inside another function might make `method_a` harder to read and understand.\n\n### Example Decision:\n\nGiven your example, if `method_b` is a simple helper function that is tightly coupled to `method_a`, it makes sense to define it inside `method_a`:\n\n```python\ndef method_a(arg):\n    \n    def method_b(arg):\n        return some_data\n\n    some_data = method_b(arg)\n    # Additional logic for method_a\n```\n\nHowever, if you foresee `method_b` being useful elsewhere or if it requires independent testing, it's better to keep it at the module level:\n\n```python\ndef method_b(arg):\n    return some_data\n\ndef method_a(arg):\n    some_data = method_b(arg)\n    # Additional logic for method_a\n```\n\nUltimately, the choice depends on your specific needs for code organization, readability, and future maintainability."
