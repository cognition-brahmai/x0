For instance, how can I extract \"google.com\" from a full URL like \"http://www.google.com\"? I've tried using the netloc attribute of urlparse but it includes the subdomain, resulting in \"www.google.com\". Is there a way to achieve this without using any custom string transforms or regex, as I am not familiar with URL formation rules to handle all possible edge cases? If urlparse can't solve this, are there any other Python URL-parsing libraries that could?"

        "content": "Extracting the domain name without the subdomain from a URL using Python's `urlparse` can be a bit tricky because `urlparse` itself does not directly provide a way to separate the subdomain from the domain. However, you can use a library like `tldextract` which is specifically designed to handle this kind of task.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this using `tldextract`:\n\n1. First, you need to install the `tldextract` library. You can do this using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install tldextract\n   ```\n\n2. Then, you can use the following code to extract the domain name without the subdomain:\n\n   ```python\n   import tldextract\n\n   url = \"http://www.google.com\"\n   extracted = tldextract.extract(url)\n   domain = f\"{extracted.domain}.{extracted.suffix}\"\n\n   print(domain)  # Output: google.com\n   ```\n\nThe `tldextract` library parses the URL and separates it into the subdomain, domain, and suffix (top-level domain). By combining the domain and suffix, you get the main domain without any subdomains.\n\nThis approach handles a wide range of edge cases and international domain names accurately, as `tldextract` maintains an up-to-date list of TLDs and effectively separates the components of a URL."
