I tried installing Python 3.4 using `yum install python34` from CentOS 7 EPEL, and although Python 3.4 installs successfully, pip does not seem to be installed. Running `which pip3` or `which pip` does not find anything. How can I access pip from the Python 3.4 package in CentOS 7 EPEL release?"

Install it using:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo yum install python34-setuptools\n   ```\n\n3. **Install `pip` using `easy_install`**:\n   Once `setuptools` is installed, you can use `easy_install` to install `pip`:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo easy_install-3.4 pip\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify the Installation**:\n   After the installation, you can verify that `pip` is installed for Python 3.4 by checking its version:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip3 --version\n   ```\n\n   If you get an output showing the version of `pip`, the installation was successful.\n\nThese steps should help you get `pip` installed for Python 3.4 on CentOS 7. If you encounter any issues, ensure that your system is up-to-date and that you have the necessary permissions to install packages."
