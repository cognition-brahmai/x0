How can I solve this issue to generate the 3D lines?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is because the `ax.plot` method in Matplotlib expects each dimension (x, y, z) to be a single sequence of points (e.g., a list or numpy array) that it connects in order, rather than two separate lists for start and end points. \n\nTo draw lines between pairs of points, you need to iterate over each pair of start and end points and plot them individually. Here's an updated version of your code that should work:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\n\n# Define start and end points\nVecStart_x = [0, 1, 3, 5]\nVecStart_y = [2, 2, 5, 5]\nVecStart_z = [0, 1, 1, 5]\nVecEnd_x = [1, 2, -1, 6]\nVecEnd_y = [3, 1, -2, 7]\nVecEnd_z = [1, 0, 4, 9]\n\n# Create a new figure and 3D axes\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')\n\n# Plot each line\nfor i in range(len(VecStart_x)):\n    ax.plot([VecStart_x[i], VecEnd_x[i]],\n            [VecStart_y[i], VecEnd_y[i]],\n            [VecStart_z[i], VecEnd_z[i]])\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nHere, we iterate over each index and plot a line segment between the start and end points for that index. This should plot the desired 3D lines without the ValueError."
