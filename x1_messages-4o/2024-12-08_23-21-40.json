If there is an obstacle in the way, the character should not move and an error message should be displayed. \n- Furthermore, the program should keep track of the character's movements and display a log of their previous locations in a table format on the screen. \n- Lastly, the program should include a timer that tracks the amount of time it takes for the character to reach the top of the screen, and display the time at the end of the game."
