        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the absence of the SSL module, which is required for secure connections when using pip. This typically happens when Python is built without SSL support. To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the necessary SSL libraries and development headers are installed on your system before compiling Python.\n\nHere are the steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Install SSL Development Libraries**: Before compiling Python, make sure you have the SSL development libraries installed. You can do this by running the following command:\n\n   For Ubuntu/Debian:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install -y libssl-dev\n   ```\n\n   For CentOS/RHEL:\n   ```bash\n   sudo yum install openssl-devel\n   ```\n\n2. **Recompile Python**: After installing the SSL development libraries, recompile Python to ensure that the SSL module is properly built.\n\n   ```bash\n   cd Python-3.6.0\n   make clean  # Clean up previous build artifacts\n   ./configure --enable-optimizations\n   make -j8\n   sudo make altinstall\n   ```\n\n3. **Recreate the Virtual Environment**: Once Python is recompiled, recreate the virtual environment to ensure it uses the updated Python build with SSL support.\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.6 -m venv py36venv\n   source py36venv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n4. **Install `pep8` using `pip`**: Now, try installing `pep8` again within the virtual environment.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pep8\n   ```\n\nIf you follow these steps, the SSL module should be available, and you should be able to install `pep8` without any issues."
