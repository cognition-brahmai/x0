However, I am encountering an error stating 'NearestNeighbors' object has no attribute 'predict'. Here is the code I am working with:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors\nsamples = [[0., 0., 0.], [0., .5, 0.], [1., 1., .5]]\nneigh = NearestNeighbors()\nneigh.fit(samples)\nneigh.predict([[1., 1., 1.]]) # this line causes the error\n```\n\nThe error message I am receiving is: \n\n```python\nAttributeError: 'NearestNeighbors' object has no attribute 'predict'\n```\n\nI've checked the documentation and it mentions the predict function: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html. Could someone help me understand how I can use the predict function in this scenario?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is because you're using the `NearestNeighbors` class, which is intended for unsupervised nearest neighbors searches, and does not have a `predict` method. Instead, you should use the `KNeighborsClassifier` class if you want to perform classification and use the `predict` method.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use `KNeighborsClassifier`:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\n\n# Sample data\nsamples = [[0., 0., 0.], [0., .5, 0.], [1., 1., .5]]\n# Corresponding labels for classification\nlabels = [0, 0, 1]\n\n# Initialize KNeighborsClassifier\nknn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=1)\n\n# Fit the model with the samples and their labels\nknn.fit(samples, labels)\n\n# Use the predict method\npredicted_label = knn.predict([[1., 1., 1.]])\n\nprint(predicted_label)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **KNeighborsClassifier**: This class is used for supervised learning. It requires both feature data (`samples`) and corresponding target labels (`labels`). \n\n2. **Predict Method**: Once the classifier is trained using `fit` with samples and labels, you can use the `predict` method to predict the label of new data points.\n\n3. **NearestNeighbors**: This is used for unsupervised learning tasks like finding the nearest points in a dataset, and it does not support prediction of labels.\n\nBy switching to `KNeighborsClassifier` and providing it with labels, you will be able to use the `predict` method successfully."
