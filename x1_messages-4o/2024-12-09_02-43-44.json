        "content": "To manage tasks from another thread in a multi-threaded application using `asyncio`, you need to be able to create and subsequently cancel tasks effectively. The `call_soon_threadsafe` method is indeed useful for scheduling coroutine execution in an asyncio event loop from other threads. Here's how you can implement a solution to create and cancel tasks from another thread:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nfrom threading import Thread\nimport time\nimport functools\n\nclass B(Thread):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.loop = None\n        self.tasks = {}\n\n    def run(self):\n        self.loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()\n        asyncio.set_event_loop(self.loop)\n        self.loop.run_forever()\n\n    def stop(self):\n        self.loop.call_soon_threadsafe(self.loop.stop)\n\n    def add_task(self, coro):\n        \"\"\"Create a task and return its id.\"\"\"\n        task_id = id(coro)\n        def create_task():\n            task = self.loop.create_task(coro)\n            self.tasks[task_id] = task\n            return task\n        self.loop.call_soon_threadsafe(create_task)\n        return task_id\n\n    def cancel_task(self, task_id):\n        \"\"\"Cancel a task by its id.\"\"\"\n        def cancel():\n            task = self.tasks.pop(task_id, None)\n            if task:\n                task.cancel()\n        self.loop.call_soon_threadsafe(cancel)\n\n@asyncio.coroutine\ndef test():\n    try:\n        while True:\n            print(\"running\")\n            yield from asyncio.sleep(1)\n    except asyncio.CancelledError:\n        print(\"Task cancelled\")\n\nb = B()\nb.start()\ntime.sleep(1)  # Wait for the loop to start\n\n# Add a task\ntask_id = b.add_task(test())\ntime.sleep(5)\n\n# Cancel the task\nb.cancel_task(task_id)\n\n# Stop the loop\nb.stop()\n\nb.join()  # Ensure the thread finishes execution\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Task Management**: \n   - A dictionary `self.tasks` is used to keep track of tasks by their IDs.\n   - The `add_task` method creates a task and stores it in the dictionary.\n\n2. **Task Creation**:\n   - A unique ID (result of `id(coro)`) is used to identify the task.\n   - The creation of tasks is wrapped in a function and scheduled with `call_soon_threadsafe`.\n\n3. **Task Cancellation**:\n   - The `cancel_task` method retrieves the task from the dictionary using the task ID and cancels it.\n\n4. **Coroutine Handling**:\n   - The coroutine `test` includes a try-except block to handle `asyncio.CancelledError`, ensuring it can clean up when cancelled.\n\n5. **Thread Management**:\n   - The thread's `run` method sets up and runs the event loop.\n   - Ensure the loop is stopped and the thread is joined for clean termination.\n\nThis approach provides a simple mechanism for managing tasks from another thread in `asyncio`, allowing you to create and cancel tasks as needed."
