Here's how it works: the machine will take the smaller number and perform a series of calculations. It will first add the digits of the number together. If the result is a factor of the larger number, the machine will move on to the next step. If not, it will try a different calculation. The machine will then subtract the original smaller number from the sum of its digits. If the result is a factor of the larger number, the machine will move on again. If not, it will try yet another calculation. The machine will then take the sum of the digits of the result and check if it's divisible by 3. If it is, the machine will move on to the next step. If not, it will try another calculation. Finally, the machine will multiply the smaller number by the sum of its digits. If the result is a factor of the larger number, the machine will output it as the mystery number. Can you crack the code and figure out the mystery number for your two inputs? Good luck!"
