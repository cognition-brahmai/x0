For example, given an array: \n```python\nx = np.array([ 1230.,  1230.,  1227.,  1235.,  1217.,  1153.,  1170.])\n```\nI want to produce another array like:\n```python\nxm = np.array([ 1230.,  1228.5,  1231.,  1226.,  1185.,  1161.5])\n```"

        "content": "You can achieve this by using NumPy's vectorized operations, which allow you to perform operations on entire arrays without the need for explicit loops. To generate a new array where each element is the mean of each pair of consecutive values in your original array, you can use slicing and the `np.mean` function. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original array\nx = np.array([1230., 1230., 1227., 1235., 1217., 1153., 1170.])\n\n# Calculate the mean of each pair of consecutive elements\nxm = (x[:-1] + x[1:]) / 2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(xm)\n```\n\nThis code works by slicing the original array `x` to create two arrays: `x[:-1]` which contains all elements except the last one, and `x[1:]` which contains all elements except the first one. These two arrays are then added together element-wise, and the result is divided by 2 to get the mean of each pair of consecutive values. The resulting array `xm` will have one fewer element than the original array `x`."
