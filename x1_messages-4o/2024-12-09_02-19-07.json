Suppose I have the following matrix (X):\n\n```\n[1, 2, 3]\n[4, 5, 6]\n[7, 8, 9]\n```\nAnd I have a list of column indexes for each row (Y):\n```\n[1, 0, 2]\n```\nI need to get the values:\n```\n[2]\n[4]\n[9]\n```\nAlternatively, I can also produce a matrix with the same shape as X where each column is a bool/int in the range 0-1 value, indicating whether it's the required column:\n```\n[0, 1, 0]\n[1, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 1]\n```\nI know it's possible to do this with iteration over the array, but I need a faster solution as this operation will be conducted frequently on large arrays of data."

        "content": "To achieve the selection of specific columns per row in a NumPy matrix using a list of indexes efficiently without iteration, you can use NumPy's advanced indexing capabilities. Here is how you can do it:\n\nGiven your matrix `X` and the list of column indexes `Y`, you can use the following approach:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define your matrix X\nX = np.array([\n    [1, 2, 3],\n    [4, 5, 6],\n    [7, 8, 9]\n])\n\n# Define your list of column indexes Y\nY = np.array([1, 0, 2])\n\n# Use advanced indexing to select specific columns per row\nselected_values = X[np.arange(X.shape[0]), Y]\n\nprint(selected_values)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n[2 4 9]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. `np.arange(X.shape[0])` generates an array `[0, 1, 2]` representing the row indices.\n2. `Y` is your array of column indices `[1, 0, 2]`.\n3. `X[np.arange(X.shape[0]), Y]` uses advanced indexing to select the elements at the specified row and column indices.\n\nFor creating a boolean matrix indicating the selected columns, you can do the following:\n\n```python\n# Create a boolean matrix with the same shape as X, initialized to False\nbool_matrix = np.zeros_like(X, dtype=int)\n\n# Set True for the selected columns\nbool_matrix[np.arange(X.shape[0]), Y] = 1\n\nprint(bool_matrix)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n[[0 1 0]\n [1 0 0]\n [0 0 1]]\n```\n\nBy using advanced indexing, you avoid the need for explicit loops, making the operation efficient for large arrays."
