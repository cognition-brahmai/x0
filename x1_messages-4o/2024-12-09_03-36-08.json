        "content": "I'm experiencing an issue while writing a test for a Django Rest Framework view, following the testing documentation closely. My simple test is designed to check if the `PatientDetailApi` opens correctly. However, when I run the test, it fails with the message `AssertionError: Expected view PatientDetailApi to be called with a URL keyword argument named \"pk\". Fix your URL conf, or set the `.lookup_field` attribute on the view correctly.` Despite having `pk` kwargs in the URL and the view opening correctly, the test still fails. I've checked the documentation and it states that there's no need to add the `lookup-field` value explicitly if it defaults to `pk`. Why am I getting this error and how can I fix it? Here's the relevant code for the 'main' `url.py`, `pacjent.urls`, and `PatientDetailApi`:\n\n'main' `url.py`:\n```python\nurlpatterns = [\n    url(r'^pacjent/', include('pacjent.urls')),\n] \n```\n\n`pacjent.urls`:\n```python\nurl(r'^api/szczegoly/(?P<pk>\\d+)/$', PatientDetailApi.as_view(), name=\"api_pacjent\"),\n```\n\n`PatientDetailApi`:\n```python\nclass PatientDetailApi(generics.RetrieveUpdateAPIView):\n    model = Patient\n    serializer_class = PatientDetailsSerializer\n    queryset = Patient.objects.all()\n\n    authentication_classes = (SessionAuthentication, BasicAuthentication)\n    permission_classes = (IsAuthenticated,) \n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with your test for the `PatientDetailApi` view likely stems from the way the URL is configured or how the test is set up. Here are a few steps and suggestions to help you troubleshoot and potentially fix the problem:\n\n1. **Check URL Configuration:**\n   - Ensure that the URL pattern is correctly defined and that it matches the pattern expected by the view. The URL pattern you provided looks correct:\n     ```python\n     url(r'^api/szczegoly/(?P<pk>\\d+)/$', PatientDetailApi.as_view(), name=\"api_pacjent\"),\n     ```\n   - Verify that the `url` function is correctly imported from `django.conf.urls`.\n\n2. **Test URL and View:**\n   - Double-check that the URL pattern correctly passes the `pk` to the view and that the test calls the URL with a valid `pk`.\n   - Ensure that the test client is using the correct URL and that it includes a valid primary key that exists in the database.\n\n3. **Test Configuration:**\n   - Make sure your test is correctly set up to hit the URL with a proper `pk`. Here's a sample test setup:\n     ```python\n     from django.urls import reverse\n     from rest_framework import status\n     from rest_framework.test import APITestCase\n     from .models import Patient\n\n     class PatientDetailApiTest(APITestCase):\n         def setUp(self):\n             self.patient = Patient.objects.create(...)  # Fill in with appropriate fields\n             self.url = reverse('api_pacjent', kwargs={'pk': self.patient.pk})\n\n         def test_retrieve_patient_detail(self):\n             self.client.force_authenticate(user=self.patient.user)  # Adjust user authentication as needed\n             response = self.client.get(self.url)\n\n             self.assertEqual(response.status_code, status.HTTP_200_OK)\n     ```\n\n4. **Lookup Field:**\n   - Although the `lookup_field` defaults to `pk`, you might try explicitly setting it in the view to see if it resolves the issue:\n     ```python\n     class PatientDetailApi(generics.RetrieveUpdateAPIView):\n         model = Patient\n         serializer_class = PatientDetailsSerializer\n         queryset = Patient.objects.all()\n         lookup_field = 'pk'\n\n         authentication_classes = (SessionAuthentication, BasicAuthentication)\n         permission_classes = (IsAuthenticated,)\n     ```\n\n5. **Database State:**\n   - Ensure your test database is populated with the necessary data for the test. If the `pk` you are using in the test does not correspond to an actual `Patient` object, the test will fail.\n\n6. **Error Messages:**\n   - Pay attention to any additional error messages or stack traces that come with the assertion error, as they might provide more context about what is going wrong.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue causing the test to fail. If the problem persists, consider adding debug output to see the exact state of your test environment at runtime."
