I am able to load the themes using the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom jupyterthemes import get_themes\nimport jupyterthemes as jt\nfrom jupyterthemes.stylefx import set_nb_theme\nset_nb_theme('solarizedd')\n```\n\nThe theme is applied successfully, but the toolbar and notebook name do not appear. Even when I use the Toggle Header and Toggle Name from view in menu bar, it has no effect. I am unsure about how to use the switches like `-T` and `-N` for calling the toolbar and notebook name. How can I solve this issue?"

        "content": "It sounds like you are experiencing an issue with the Jupyter Notebook theme configuration, particularly with the visibility of the toolbar and notebook name. The `jupyterthemes` package allows you to customize your Jupyter Notebook experience, but sometimes certain elements like the toolbar and notebook name might not be displayed as expected due to theme settings.\n\nHere\u2019s what you can try to solve the issue:\n\n1. **Restore Default Settings**: \n   Before applying a new theme, you can reset to the default settings to ensure there are no leftover configurations affecting the display:\n   ```bash\n   jt -r\n   ```\n\n2. **Use Theme Options**:\n   When setting a theme, you can use `-T` to display the toolbar and `-N` to show the notebook name. Modify your theme command like this:\n   ```bash\n   jt -t solarizedd -T -N\n   ```\n\n   Here, `-T` is for toggling the toolbar, and `-N` is for toggling the notebook name.\n\n3. **Check Theme Compatibility**:\n   Ensure that the theme you are using (`solarizedd` in this case) is compatible with the latest version of Jupyter Notebook. Some themes might not be fully compatible with newer versions.\n\n4. **Manually Toggle Toolbar and Name**:\n   If the above options don't work, you can manually toggle the toolbar and notebook name from the Jupyter Notebook interface:\n   - Go to the `View` menu in the Jupyter Notebook interface.\n   - Select `Toggle Header` and `Toggle Toolbar` to see if it resolves the issue.\n\n5. **Update Jupyter and Jupyter Themes**:\n   Ensure you have the latest versions of Jupyter Notebook and the `jupyterthemes` package:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade jupyter jupyterthemes\n   ```\n\n6. **Check for Errors**:\n   Open the browser\u2019s developer console (usually accessible by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`) and check for any errors that might provide additional insights into what might be going wrong.\n\n7. **Custom CSS Adjustments**:\n   If you are comfortable with CSS, you can further customize your Jupyter Notebook's appearance by editing the custom CSS file that `jupyterthemes` creates:\n   ```bash\n   # Find the custom.css file\n   ~/.jupyter/custom/custom.css\n   ```\n   You can manually adjust the CSS to ensure the toolbar and notebook name are visible.\n\nIf none of these solutions work, consider reporting the issue to the `jupyterthemes` GitHub repository, as it might be a bug that needs to be addressed by the developers."
