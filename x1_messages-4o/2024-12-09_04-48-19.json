I am trying to iterate over the array in OpenCV and change every single value with the following formula: `img[x,y] = abs(img[x,y] - 255)`. However, it doesn't seem to be working as expected. When I run my code, an image with a white background turns black, but the other colors don't seem to change much, if at all. Could you help me understand what's wrong with my code?\n\nHere's my code: \n\n```python\ndef inverte(imagem, name):\n    imagem = abs(imagem - 255)\n    cv2.imwrite(name, imagem)\n\n\ndef inverte2(imagem, name):\n    for x in np.nditer(imagem, op_flags=['readwrite']):\n        x = abs(x - 255)\n    cv2.imwrite(name, imagem)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    nome = str(sys.argv[1])\n    image = cv2.imread(nome)\n    gs_imagem = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\n    inverte(gs_imagem, \"invertida.png\")\n    inverte2(gs_imagem, \"invertida2.png\")\n```"

        "content": "It looks like you're trying to invert a grayscale image, but there's a small issue in your code that's causing it not to work as expected. Let's go through the two functions you're using and identify the corrections needed.\n\n### Invert Function 1: `inverte`\n\nIn this function, you're inverting the image using the formula `imagem = abs(imagem - 255)`. This should work correctly for inverting grayscale images. However, ensure that you are not modifying the original image data when you call `inverte2` afterward. Here's a corrected version:\n\n```python\ndef inverte(imagem, name):\n    inverted_image = 255 - imagem\n    cv2.imwrite(name, inverted_image)\n```\n\n### Invert Function 2: `inverte2`\n\nIn this function, you're using `np.nditer` to iterate over the image. However, the assignment `x = abs(x - 255)` does not modify the original array because `x` is a copy of each element. To modify the array, you should use `x[...] = 255 - x`. Here's a corrected version:\n\n```python\ndef inverte2(imagem, name):\n    for x in np.nditer(imagem, op_flags=['readwrite']):\n        x[...] = 255 - x\n    cv2.imwrite(name, imagem)\n```\n\n### Main Function\n\nMake sure that when you call `inverte` and `inverte2`, you pass a copy of the original grayscale image to avoid modifying it in place, which could affect subsequent operations. Here's the updated main structure:\n\n```python\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    nome = str(sys.argv[1])\n    image = cv2.imread(nome)\n    gs_imagem = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\n    \n    # Inverting using the first method\n    inverte(gs_imagem.copy(), \"invertida.png\")\n    \n    # Inverting using the second method\n    inverte2(gs_imagem.copy(), \"invertida2.png\")\n```\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n1. **Copy the Image**: Always use a copy of the image when testing different methods to avoid accidental overwrites.\n2. **Check Output**: Verify that \"invertida.png\" and \"invertida2.png\" produce the expected results.\n3. **Image Display**: You can use `cv2.imshow()` to display images for quick debugging before saving them.\n\nWith these corrections, your code should correctly invert the grayscale image. Let me know if you have any more questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!"
