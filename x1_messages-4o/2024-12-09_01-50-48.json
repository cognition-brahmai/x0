This module provides a comprehensive way to handle both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, including checking if an IP address is private.\n\nHere's how you can use the `ipaddress` module to check if an IP address is part of a private network:\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef is_private_ip(ip):\n    try:\n        # Create an IP address object\n        ip_obj = ipaddress.ip_address(ip)\n        # Check if the IP address is private\n        return ip_obj.is_private\n    except ValueError:\n        # Handle the exception for invalid IP addresses\n        return False\n\n# Example usage\nprint(is_private_ip('127.0.0.1'))  # True\nprint(is_private_ip('10.98.76.6')) # True\nprint(is_private_ip('8.8.8.8'))    # False\nprint(is_private_ip('2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334')) # False\nprint(is_private_ip('fd00::'))     # True\n```\n\nThis code checks if the given IP address is private by creating an IP address object using `ipaddress.ip_address(ip)` and then using the `is_private` attribute to determine if it belongs to a private network.\n\nThe `ipaddress` module handles both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and considers all the edge cases, including loopback addresses like `127.0.0.1` and IPv6 private address ranges. It is a robust and reliable way to perform this task without requiring any third-party libraries."
