I have tried creating a new column of integers in my dataframe and setting that as the size, but it seems that the actual value doesn't matter as it changes the marker size on a relative basis, which results in all the markers being the same size as the default. Here's the code I am working with:\n\n```python\nax = sns.scatterplot(x=\"Data Set Description\", y=\"R Squared\", data=mean_df)\nplt.show()\n```\n\nI have tried a workaround where I set all sizes to be the same, and the range of sizes to be only at 500. Is there a better method?"

        "content": "To change the marker size for all markers in a Seaborn scatterplot, you can use the `s` parameter within the `sns.scatterplot` function, which allows you to specify the size of the markers directly. This parameter accepts a scalar value that sets a uniform size for all markers. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Assuming mean_df is your DataFrame\nax = sns.scatterplot(x=\"Data Set Description\", y=\"R Squared\", data=mean_df, s=100)  # Set s to your desired size\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this example, `s=100` sets the marker size to 100 points. You can adjust this value to make the markers larger or smaller according to your needs. This way, all markers will have the same size, and you don't need to modify your DataFrame or create additional columns."
