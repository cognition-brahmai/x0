I tried using `[key.name for key in list(self.bucket.list())]`, but it returns the keys of all the files. For example, I get the list as shown below:\n```\nmybucket/files/pdf/abc.pdf\nmybucket/files/pdf/abc2.pdf\nmybucket/files/pdf/abc3.pdf\nmybucket/files/pdf/abc4.pdf\nmybucket/files/pdf/new/\nmybucket/files/pdf/new/abc.pdf\nmybucket/files/pdf/2011/\n```\nWhat would be the most efficient way to either get all folders from S3 or just remove the file from the last and get the unique keys of folders? I am contemplating using the following code: `set([re.sub(\"/[^/]*$\",\"/\",path) for path in mylist])`."

        "content": "To efficiently fetch the list of folders in an Amazon S3 bucket using Python and Boto3 (the latest version of the AWS SDK for Python), you can utilize the `list_objects_v2` method with the appropriate prefix and delimiter. The delimiter is typically a forward slash (`/`), which helps to treat keys as a hierarchy (similar to folders). Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide\n\n1. **Install Boto3**: If you haven't already, install Boto3 using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install boto3\n   ```\n\n2. **Use Boto3 to List Folders**: You can use the following Python code to list the folders.\n\n```python\nimport boto3\n\ndef list_s3_folders(bucket_name, prefix=''):\n    s3 = boto3.client('s3')\n    \n    # List objects with a prefix and delimiter to get folders\n    response = s3.list_objects_v2(\n        Bucket=bucket_name,\n        Prefix=prefix,\n        Delimiter='/'\n    )\n\n    # Extract folder names from CommonPrefixes\n    folders = [content['Prefix'] for content in response.get('CommonPrefixes', [])]\n    \n    return folders\n\n# Example usage\nbucket_name = 'your-bucket-name'\nprefix = 'your-prefix/'  # Adjust the prefix if you want to start from a specific path\nfolders = list_s3_folders(bucket_name, prefix)\n\n# Print the list of folders\nfor folder in folders:\n    print(folder)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Boto3 Client**: We create a Boto3 client for S3 which allows us to interact with S3 service.\n  \n- **list_objects_v2**: This method lists the objects in the specified bucket. By setting the `Delimiter` parameter to `/`, it treats the keys as a hierarchy, and `CommonPrefixes` contains the \"folders\" within the specified prefix.\n\n- **Prefix**: This is used if you want to list folders from a specific path within the bucket. You can leave it as an empty string if you want to start from the root.\n\n- **CommonPrefixes**: The response includes a `CommonPrefixes` key, which contains all the folder names (or prefixes) satisfying the given prefix.\n\nThis method is efficient because it leverages the built-in capabilities of S3 to simulate folder structures using prefixes and delimiters, reducing the need for post-processing the list of all keys."
