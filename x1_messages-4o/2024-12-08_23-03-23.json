        "content": "When a liquid is heated, several physical changes can occur:\n\n1. **Temperature Increase**: As heat is applied, the temperature of the liquid rises. This increase in temperature corresponds to an increase in the kinetic energy of the liquid's molecules.\n\n2. **Phase Change to Gas**: Upon reaching its boiling point, a liquid can undergo a phase change and become a gas through the process of vaporization or boiling. This transition involves the liquid molecules gaining enough energy to overcome intermolecular forces and enter the gaseous state.\n\n3. **Expansion**: As the liquid's temperature increases, it tends to expand. The molecules move more vigorously and occupy a larger volume, leading to thermal expansion of the liquid.\n\nThese changes are fundamental to the behavior of liquids when subjected to heat."
