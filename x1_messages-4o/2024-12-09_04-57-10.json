You can do this using a list comprehension or the `filter()` function. Here's how you can implement it:\n\nUsing a list comprehension:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [None, 1, 2]\nmin_value = min([x for x in numbers if x is not None])\nprint(min_value)\n```\n\nUsing the `filter()` function:\n\n```python\nnumbers = [None, 1, 2]\nmin_value = min(filter(lambda x: x is not None, numbers))\nprint(min_value)\n```\n\nBoth of these methods will ignore `None` values and return `1` as the minimum value from the list `[None, 1, 2]`."
