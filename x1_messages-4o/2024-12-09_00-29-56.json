However, I am encountering an error when I run \"python3\" in the terminal and then \"from app import db\". The error message is \"ImportError: cannot import name 'Mapping' from 'collections'\". I have tried troubleshooting this issue, but none of my attempts have been successful. Could you please provide some advice on how to resolve this? Here is the full stack trace for reference:\n\n```\nImportError: cannot import name 'Mapping' from 'collections' (/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.10/lib/python3.10/collections/__init__.py)\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to a change in Python 3.10 where the `Mapping` class was moved from the `collections` module to the `collections.abc` module. This change can cause compatibility issues with libraries that haven't been updated to accommodate it. Here's how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Update Dependencies:** Check if there are newer versions of the libraries you're using. Updating them might fix the compatibility issue with Python 3.10.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade <library_name>\n   ```\n\n2. **Modify Your Code (Temporary Fix):** If the issue is in a library that hasn't been updated yet, you can manually modify the import statement in the library's code as a temporary fix:\n\n   - Navigate to the file that is causing the issue (you can find this in the stack trace).\n   - Replace `from collections import Mapping` with `from collections.abc import Mapping`.\n\n3. **Downgrade Python:** If you can't update the library or modify its code, consider downgrading your Python version to 3.9, where `Mapping` was still part of the `collections` module.\n\n   - You can do this using a Python version manager like `pyenv`.\n\n     ```bash\n     pyenv install 3.9.7\n     pyenv global 3.9.7\n     ```\n\n4. **Check Your Code:** Ensure that the import statement is correct in your own code if you're directly importing `Mapping` from `collections`.\n\n5. **Virtual Environment:** Make sure you are using a virtual environment to manage your packages and Python version. This can help avoid conflicts and make it easier to switch Python versions.\n\n6. **Contact Library Maintainers:** If the library is essential and hasn't been updated to support Python 3.10, consider contacting the maintainers to see if they plan to release a compatible version.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the import error you're experiencing."
