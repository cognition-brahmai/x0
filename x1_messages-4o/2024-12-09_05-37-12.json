When I use `pip install -U`, it attempts to upgrade all the packages and even uninstalls and reinstalls the same version of a dependency package when there isn't a new version available. I've also tried `pip install -U --no-deps` but it seems to act as a regular install instead of an upgrade. Is there any combination of flags that can perform this operation?"

        "content": "Upgrading a specific package without upgrading its dependencies using `pip` can indeed be a bit tricky. By default, `pip install -U` will try to upgrade not only the specified package but also any dependencies that have newer versions available. The `--no-deps` flag can be used to prevent `pip` from installing dependencies, but as you observed, it does not behave as a typical upgrade when used with `-U`.\n\nHere's a method to achieve your goal:\n\n1. **Use `--no-deps` to upgrade only the specific package**: While you\u2019ve noticed that `--no-deps` seems to act like a regular install, it can still be useful in this context. This flag prevents `pip` from considering any dependencies during the upgrade. You can run:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade --no-deps package_name\n   ```\n\n   This command will upgrade the specified package without touching its dependencies. However, it's important to ensure that the package will still be compatible with the installed versions of its dependencies.\n\n2. **Control dependencies manually**: If you encounter issues where the upgraded package requires specific versions of dependencies that are not met, you might need to manually manage the dependencies. You can specify exact versions for dependencies in your `requirements.txt` file or use a tool like `pipenv` or `poetry` to manage your environment with more granularity.\n\n3. **Check compatibility**: After upgrading the package, it's a good idea to test your application to ensure that the new version of the package works well with the current versions of its dependencies. This can help catch any potential compatibility issues early.\n\nBy using these methods, you can achieve more control over which packages are upgraded in your Python environment."
