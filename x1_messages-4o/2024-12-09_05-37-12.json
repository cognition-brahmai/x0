For instance, I want to check if variables A, B, C, and D are all greater than or equal to 2, and if so, print them. However, I am unsure about the correct syntax for this in Python. Can you provide the correct syntax for this type of if statement?"

        "content": "Certainly! In Python, you can use an `if` statement to check if multiple variables satisfy a condition by chaining them with logical operators. For your specific case, where you want to check if variables `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` are all greater than or equal to 2, you can use the `and` logical operator to combine the conditions. Here's how you can write the `if` statement:\n\n```python\nA = 3  # Example values\nB = 4\nC = 2\nD = 5\n\nif A >= 2 and B >= 2 and C >= 2 and D >= 2:\n    print(A, B, C, D)\n```\n\nThis code will print the values of `A`, `B`, `C`, and `D` if all of them are greater than or equal to 2. If any of them is less than 2, the block inside the `if` statement will not execute."
