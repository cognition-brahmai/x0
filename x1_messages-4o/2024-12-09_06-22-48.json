        "content": "How can I include additional files in my `build` directory when using cx_Freeze to create an executable on a Windows system with Python 2.6 and cx_Freeze 4.1.2? I have a setup.py file and my project structure is as follows:\n\n```\nsrc\\\n    setup.py\n    janitor.py\n    README.txt\n    CHANGELOG.txt\n    helpers\\\n        uncompress\\\n            unRAR.exe\n            unzip.exe\n```\n\nI attempted to include the additional files in the `data_files` field in my setup function, but it doesn't seem to be working. Do I need a `MANIFEST.in` file? Here's the code snippet from my setup function:\n\n```\nsetup\n(\n  name='Janitor',\n  version='1.0',\n  description='Janitor',\n  author='John Doe',\n  author_email='john.doe@gmail.com',\n  url='http://www.this-page-intentionally-left-blank.org/',\n  data_files = \n      [ ('helpers\\uncompress', ['helpers\\uncompress\\unzip.exe']),\n        ('helpers\\uncompress', ['helpers\\uncompress\\unRAR.exe']),\n        ('', ['README.txt'])\n      ],\n  executables =\n      [\n      Executable\\\n          (\n          'janitor.py', #initScript\n          )\n      ]\n)\n```"

        "content": "To include additional files in your `build` directory when using cx_Freeze, you should use the `include_files` option available in the `Executable` or `build_exe` options within your `setup.py` script. The `data_files` option is generally used for installing files with standard Python distributions and is not directly applicable when using cx_Freeze.\n\nHere's how you can modify your `setup.py` file to include additional files:\n\n```python\nfrom cx_Freeze import setup, Executable\n\n# Define the files you want to include\ninclude_files = [\n    ('helpers/uncompress/unRAR.exe', 'helpers/uncompress/unRAR.exe'),\n    ('helpers/uncompress/unzip.exe', 'helpers/uncompress/unzip.exe'),\n    ('README.txt', 'README.txt'),\n    ('CHANGELOG.txt', 'CHANGELOG.txt')\n]\n\n# Define the build options\nbuild_exe_options = {\n    'include_files': include_files,\n}\n\n# Setup function\nsetup(\n    name='Janitor',\n    version='1.0',\n    description='Janitor',\n    author='John Doe',\n    author_email='john.doe@gmail.com',\n    url='http://www.this-page-intentionally-left-blank.org/',\n    options={\n        'build_exe': build_exe_options\n    },\n    executables=[\n        Executable('janitor.py')\n    ]\n)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **include_files**: This option in the `build_exe` dictionary allows you to specify additional files and directories to include in the build directory. Each tuple specifies the source path and the destination path relative to the build directory.\n\n2. **Path Separators**: Use forward slashes `/` or double backslashes `\\\\` in the paths to ensure compatibility across different environments.\n\n3. **Destination Paths**: Specifying the destination path as part of the tuple allows you to control where the files are placed within the build directory structure.\n\n4. **No MANIFEST.in Needed**: `MANIFEST.in` is used for source distributions and not necessary for cx_Freeze, which is focused on creating executables.\n\nRunning this setup script with `python setup.py build` should correctly include the specified additional files in the `build` directory."
