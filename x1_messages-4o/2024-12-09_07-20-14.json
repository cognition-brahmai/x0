I am using a script that creates a threadpool and schedules one map worker for each row of data. The results I get always seem to be in order, but I want to confirm if this is truly the case. This is important because in some cases I need the results to be returned in the original order for a reduce function that relies on ordered data.\n\nHere is my code:\n\n```python\nfrom multiprocessing import Pool\nimport numpy as np\nimport time\nimport random\n\nrows = 16\ncolumns = 1000000\n\nvals = np.arange(rows * columns, dtype=np.int32).reshape(rows, columns)\n\ndef worker(arr):\n    time.sleep(random.random())        # let the process sleep a random\n    for idx in np.ndindex(arr.shape):  # amount of time to ensure that\n        arr[idx] += 1                  # the processes finish at different\n                                       # time steps\n    return arr\n\n# create the threadpool\nwith Pool(4) as p:\n    # schedule one map/worker for each row in the original data\n    q = p.map(worker, [row for row in vals])\n\nfor idx, row in enumerate(q):\n    print(\"[{:0&gt;2}]: {: &gt;8} - {: &gt;8}\".format(idx, row[0], row[-1]))\n```\n\nThis is the output I am getting:\n\n```python\n[00]:        1 -  1000000\n[01]:  1000001 -  2000000\n[02]:  2000001 -  3000000\n[03]:  3000001 -  4000000\n[04]:  4000001 -  5000000\n[05]:  5000001 -  6000000\n[06]:  6000001 -  7000000\n[07]:  7000001 -  8000000\n[08]:  8000001 -  9000000\n[09]:  9000001 - 10000000\n[10]: 10000001 - 11000000\n[11]: 11000001 - 12000000\n[12]: 12000001 - 13000000\n[13]: 13000001 - 14000000\n[14]: 14000001 - 15000000\n[15]: 15000001 - 16000000\n```"

        "content": "Yes, in Python 3, the `Pool` function from the `multiprocessing` module does maintain the original order of the input data when using the `map` function. The `map` function in the `Pool` class is designed to apply a function to every item of the iterable and return the results in the same order as the input.\n\nIn your code, you are using `p.map(worker, [row for row in vals])`, which means that each row of your `vals` array is being passed to the `worker` function. The `map` function will ensure that the results are returned in the same order as the input rows, even if the processing times for different rows vary due to the random sleep you have added.\n\nThe reason you see the results in order in your output is because `map` guarantees that the results will be collected and returned in the order that corresponds to the input iterable. Therefore, you can rely on this behavior for your reduce function that requires ordered data.\n\nIf you ever need to process items in parallel without maintaining order, you could use the `imap_unordered` or `starmap_async` functions, but for maintaining order, `map` is appropriate."
