Currently when I run my code, I receive an email with an attachment, but the attachment contains a generator object reference instead of the rows that I expected from my queryset. The following is my current code:\n\n```python\ndef send_lead_reminder(request):\n    usercompany = Listing.objects.filter(submitted_by=request.user)\n    assigned_leads = lead.objects.filter(assigned_to__in=usercompany).distinct() \n    def data():\n        csvfile=StringIO.StringIO()\n        csvwriter =csv.writer(csvfile)\n        for leads in assigned_leads:\n            csvwriter.writerow([leads.business_name, leads.first_name, leads.last_name, leads.email, leads.phone_number,leads.address, leads.city, leads.state, leads.zipcode, leads.submission_date, leads.time_frame, leads.comments])\n             yield csvfile.getvalue()\n    message = EmailMessage(\"Hello\",\"Your Leads\",\"myemail@gmail.com\",[\"myemail@gmail.com\"])\n    message.attach('invoice.csv', data(), 'text/csv')\n    #message.to=\"myemail@gmail.com\"\n    message.send()\n    return HttpResponseRedirect('/')\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is due to the fact that you're using a generator for the CSV data, which is causing the email attachment to contain a reference to the generator object rather than the actual CSV content. To fix this, you need to ensure that you generate the complete CSV content as a string before attaching it to the email. Here's an updated version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport csv\nfrom io import StringIO\nfrom django.core.mail import EmailMessage\nfrom django.http import HttpResponseRedirect\nfrom .models import Listing, Lead  # Ensure you have the correct import for your models\n\ndef send_lead_reminder(request):\n    usercompany = Listing.objects.filter(submitted_by=request.user)\n    assigned_leads = Lead.objects.filter(assigned_to__in=usercompany).distinct()\n\n    # Use StringIO to store CSV content\n    csvfile = StringIO()\n    csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)\n\n    # Write the header row if needed\n    csvwriter.writerow(['Business Name', 'First Name', 'Last Name', 'Email', 'Phone Number', \n                        'Address', 'City', 'State', 'Zipcode', 'Submission Date', \n                        'Time Frame', 'Comments'])\n\n    # Write data rows\n    for lead in assigned_leads:\n        csvwriter.writerow([\n            lead.business_name, lead.first_name, lead.last_name, lead.email, \n            lead.phone_number, lead.address, lead.city, lead.state, \n            lead.zipcode, lead.submission_date, lead.time_frame, lead.comments\n        ])\n\n    # Get CSV content as a string\n    csv_content = csvfile.getvalue()\n\n    # Create and send the email\n    message = EmailMessage(\n        subject=\"Hello\",\n        body=\"Your Leads\",\n        from_email=\"myemail@gmail.com\",\n        to=[\"myemail@gmail.com\"]\n    )\n    message.attach('leads.csv', csv_content, 'text/csv')\n    message.send()\n\n    return HttpResponseRedirect('/')\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Remove Generator**: Removed the generator function and directly wrote the CSV content to the `StringIO` object.\n2. **Header Row**: Added a header row to the CSV file for better readability.\n3. **Get CSV Content**: Used `getvalue()` to retrieve the complete CSV content from the `StringIO` object before attaching it to the email.\n\nMake sure to replace `Lead` with the correct model name if it's different, and update any other specifics like field names as per your actual model structure."
