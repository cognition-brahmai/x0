It would be great if you could include a table similar to the one below with examples of metaphors and their explanations.\n| Metaphor | Explanation |\n|----------|-------------|\n| A snail on a treadmill | Slow and steady, but going nowhere fast |\n| A sloth on sedatives | So slow, it's practically asleep |\n| A one-legged turtle | Moving at a snail's pace |\n| Molasses in January | Moving so slow, it's practically frozen |\n| Dial-up internet in 2021 | The ultimate throwback to a slower time |\n| Rush hour traffic on the information superhighway | Congested and slow-moving |\nCan you also suggest any additional metaphors that you think would fit this theme?"
