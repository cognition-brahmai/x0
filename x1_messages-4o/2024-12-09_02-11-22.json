I am currently using the following code:\n\n```python\nclass Foo():\n    _rex = re.compile(\"\\d+\")\n    def bar(self, string):\n         m = _rex.match(string)\n         if m != None:\n             doStuff()\n```\n\nHowever, when I input an IP address like \"78.46.92.168:8000\", `doStuff()` is called, which I do not want. I am confused as to why the \".\" or \":\" in the IP address is matching the \"\\d+\" regex. Can you explain why this is happening and how I can correct it?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the way your regular expression `\\d+` is being used with the `match()` method. The `\\d+` pattern matches one or more digits, but when you use `match()`, it checks if the pattern matches at the beginning of the string. In your case, the IP address starts with the digits \"78\", which satisfies the `\\d+` pattern, so `match()` returns a match.\n\nTo ensure that the entire string is a number, you should use the `fullmatch()` method, which checks if the entire string matches the pattern. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nclass Foo():\n    _rex = re.compile(r\"\\d+\")\n    \n    def bar(self, string):\n        m = self._rex.fullmatch(string)\n        if m is not None:\n            self.doStuff()\n    \n    def doStuff(self):\n        print(\"The string is a number.\")\n\n# Example usage\nfoo = Foo()\nfoo.bar(\"123\")            # This will call doStuff.\nfoo.bar(\"78.46.92.168\")   # This will not call doStuff.\nfoo.bar(\"123abc\")         # This will not call doStuff.\n```\n\nBy using `fullmatch()`, you ensure that the entire string must consist solely of digits for a match to occur. This way, IP addresses or other strings that contain non-digit characters will not match the pattern."
