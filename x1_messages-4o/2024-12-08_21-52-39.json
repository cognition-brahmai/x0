To ensure fair play and safety for all participants, we need to formulate a set of rules for the marathon. \nCan you help us create an [HTML page] containing the rules for participating in the charity marathon? It should include information such as registration details, eligibility criteria, dress code, prohibited items, medical requirements, and any other relevant details. Additionally, we would like to include a [JavaScript code] that calculates the time taken by each participant to complete the marathon and displays it on the webpage. Can you help us with the code as well?"

Each section is clearly defined with headings and lists.\n\n- **JavaScript Timer**: The script allows users to input the start and end times of their marathon run. It calculates the time taken by converting the time into seconds, computing the difference, and then converting it back into hours, minutes, and seconds.\n\n- **Styling**: Basic CSS styling is applied for readability and a clean layout. You can further enhance the design as needed.\n\nYou can customize the content, style, and functionality according to your specific requirements."
