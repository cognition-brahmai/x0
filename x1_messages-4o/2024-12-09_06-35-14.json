I have two lists of functions:\n\n```python\ndef makeFun(i):\n    return lambda: i\n\na = [makeFun(i) for i in range(10)]\nb = [lambda: i for i in range(10)]\n```\n\nHowever, I have noticed that the lists `a` and `b` do not behave in the same way. For instance:\n\n```python\n>>> a[2]()\n2\n>>> b[2]()\n9\n```\n\nCan someone explain why this is happening?"

        "content": "This behavior is due to the way closures capture variables in Python, particularly in the context of lambda expressions inside loops.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **List `a`**:\n   - You are using a function `makeFun(i)` that returns a lambda. \n   - When `makeFun(i)` is called, the current value of `i` is passed as an argument and captured by the lambda. \n   - Each lambda returned by `makeFun(i)` captures its own distinct value of `i`, which is why `a[2]()` correctly returns `2`.\n\n2. **List `b`**:\n   - The lambda expression `lambda: i` is defined inside the loop but does not capture the current value of `i` at each iteration.\n   - Instead, it captures the variable `i` itself, which means all lambdas in the list `b` refer to the same `i`, which after the loop ends is `9`.\n   - Therefore, `b[2]()` returns `9`, as do all other lambdas in list `b`.\n\n### Solution:\n\nTo achieve the intended behavior for list `b`, you can use default arguments in your lambda to capture the current value of `i` at each iteration:\n\n```python\nb = [lambda i=i: i for i in range(10)]\n```\n\nThis way, each lambda expression in the list `b` gets its own copy of the current value of `i` as a default argument, and thus behaves like the functions in list `a`. Now, `b[2]()` would correctly return `2`."
