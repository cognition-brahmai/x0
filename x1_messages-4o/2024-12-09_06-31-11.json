I am aware that I could use `session.run(x)` to get the current value, but I am apprehensive that it might trigger a chain of operations. In Theano, there is a possibility to get the value using `y = theano.shared(...)` and `y_vals = y.get_value()`. What would be the equivalent method in TensorFlow?"

        "content": "In TensorFlow, to get the current value of a variable without executing a session, you can use the `.numpy()` method if you are using TensorFlow 2.x. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Create a variable\nx = tf.Variable(3.0)\n\n# Update the variable (for example)\nx.assign(5.0)\n\n# Get the current value of the variable\ncurrent_value = x.numpy()\nprint(current_value)\n```\n\nIn this example, `x.numpy()` retrieves the current value of the TensorFlow variable `x` as a NumPy array. This method is efficient and does not trigger a graph execution like `session.run(x)` would in TensorFlow 1.x.\n\nIf you are using TensorFlow 1.x, you would typically rely on sessions to evaluate tensors. However, TensorFlow 2.x has made it easier by using eager execution by default, which allows for immediate evaluation of operations and variables without the need for sessions."
