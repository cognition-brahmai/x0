        "content": "The given sequence is: 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, ...\n\nTo identify the pattern, let's examine the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- 6 - 2 = 4\n- 10 - 6 = 4\n- 14 - 10 = 4\n- 18 - 14 = 4\n- 22 - 18 = 4\n- 26 - 22 = 4\n\nThe difference between each consecutive term is 4, indicating that this is an arithmetic sequence.\n\nIn an arithmetic sequence, each term is obtained by adding a constant difference to the previous term. The general form for an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n\n\\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \\cdot d \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( a_n \\) is the \\( n \\)-th term,\n- \\( a_1 \\) is the first term,\n- \\( d \\) is the common difference.\n\nFor this sequence:\n- The first term (\\( a_1 \\)) is 2.\n- The common difference (\\( d \\)) is 4.\n\nTherefore, the formula for the \\( n \\)-th term of this sequence is:\n\n\\[ a_n = 2 + (n-1) \\cdot 4 \\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[ a_n = 2 + 4n - 4 \\]\n\\[ a_n = 4n - 2 \\]\n\nUsing this formula, you can compute any term in the sequence. For example, to find the next number after 26 (which is the 7th term), calculate the 8th term:\n\n\\[ a_8 = 4 \\cdot 8 - 2 = 32 - 2 = 30 \\]\n\nSo, the next number in the sequence is 30."
