        "content": "To achieve the desired behavior, where you can call functions on a running thread in a certain sequence, you can use a combination of a queue and a loop within the `run()` method to execute tasks sequentially. Here is an example of how you can modify your class to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport threading\nimport queue\n\nclass SomeClass(threading.Thread):\n    def __init__(self):\n        threading.Thread.__init__(self)\n        self.task_queue = queue.Queue()\n        self.running = True\n\n    def run(self):\n        while self.running:\n            # Wait for a task from the queue\n            task = self.task_queue.get()\n            if task is None:\n                # None is the signal to stop the thread\n                self.running = False\n            else:\n                # Execute the task\n                task()\n            # Indicate that the task is done\n            self.task_queue.task_done()\n\n    def doSomething(self):\n        print(\"Doing something\")\n\n    def doSomethingElse(self):\n        print(\"Doing something else\")\n\n    def add_task(self, task):\n        self.task_queue.put(task)\n\n    def stop(self):\n        # Add a None task to signal the thread to stop\n        self.add_task(None)\n\n# Instantiate and start the thread\nsomeClass = SomeClass()\nsomeClass.start()\n\n# Add tasks to the queue in the desired sequence\nsomeClass.add_task(someClass.doSomething)\nsomeClass.add_task(someClass.doSomethingElse)\nsomeClass.add_task(someClass.doSomething)\n\n# Wait for all tasks to complete\nsomeClass.task_queue.join()\n\n# Stop the thread gracefully\nsomeClass.stop()\nsomeClass.join()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Queue**: We use a `queue.Queue()` to hold tasks (functions) that the thread needs to execute. This allows you to enqueue tasks in a specific order.\n\n2. **Task Execution**: The `run()` method continuously waits for tasks from the queue and executes them. If a `None` task is received, it stops the thread.\n\n3. **Adding Tasks**: The `add_task()` method is used to add tasks to the queue. This allows you to call functions on the thread in a specific sequence.\n\n4. **Graceful Shutdown**: The `stop()` method enqueues a `None` task to signal the thread to stop running, and `join()` waits for the thread to finish.\n\nBy using this approach, you can effectively control the sequence in which the `doSomething()` and `doSomethingElse()` methods are executed by the thread."
