Here is a simple way to do it:\n\n1. Make sure you have the `requests` library installed. If not, you can install it using pip:\n   ```\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n\n2. Use the following Python code to read and print the contents of the file line-by-line:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# URL of the text file\nurl = \"http://www.myhost.com/SomeFile.txt\"\n\ntry:\n    # Send a GET request to the URL\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    \n    # Check if the request was successful\n    response.raise_for_status()\n    \n    # Iterate over each line in the response content\n    for line in response.text.splitlines():\n        print(line)\n\nexcept requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n```\n\nThis script sends a GET request to the specified URL and checks if the request was successful. It then splits the response text into lines and prints each line. If any error occurs during the request, it catches the exception and prints an error message."
