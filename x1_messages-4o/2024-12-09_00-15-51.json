        "content": "In Python 3.x (and likely in Python 2.6 and 2.7 as well), I have written three functions that look similar but have slightly different return statements. Here are the functions and their outputs:\n\n```python\n>>> def dbl_a(p): return p*2\n>>> def dbl_b(p): return(p*2)\n>>> def dbl_c(p): return (p*2)\n\n>>> dbl_a(42)\n84\n>>> dbl_b(42)\n84\n>>> dbl_c(42)\n84\n```\n\nAll three functions provide the same result and seem to be equivalent. But which one has the more correct return statement? Are there any side-effects in any of these definitions?\n\nThe same question also applies to the following situation with multiple values returned:\n\n```python\n>>> def dbl_triple_a(p): return p*2, p*3\n>>> def dbl_triple_b(p): return(p*2, p*3)\n>>> def dbl_triple_c(p): return (p*2, p*3)\n\n>>> dbl_triple_a(42)\n(84, 126)\n>>> dbl_triple_b(42)\n(84, 126)\n>>> dbl_triple_c(42)\n(84, 126)\n```\n\nIn this case, every function returns a tuple, but my questions still remain the same."

        "content": "In Python, all three return statements in your examples are functionally equivalent and there are no side effects in any of the definitions. The choice of which style to use is primarily a matter of personal or team preference, as well as readability. Let's break down each case:\n\n### Single Value Return (`dbl_a`, `dbl_b`, `dbl_c`):\n\n- **`dbl_a(p): return p*2`**: \n  - This is the simplest and most straightforward form. It's clear and concise.\n\n- **`dbl_b(p): return(p*2)`**:\n  - The parentheses are unnecessary for a single value return, but they don't change the functionality. Some might find parentheses visually helpful for grouping or readability, though it's not common practice for single expressions.\n\n- **`dbl_c(p): return (p*2)`**:\n  - Similar to `dbl_b`, the parentheses do not affect the outcome. They're redundant but harmless.\n\n### Multiple Values Return (`dbl_triple_a`, `dbl_triple_b`, `dbl_triple_c`):\n\n- **`dbl_triple_a(p): return p*2, p*3`**:\n  - In Python, returning multiple values like this automatically packs them into a tuple. It's clear and follows Python conventions.\n\n- **`dbl_triple_b(p): return(p*2, p*3)`**:\n  - Parentheses here explicitly indicate a tuple, which might make the return type more obvious to someone reading the code.\n\n- **`dbl_triple_c(p): return (p*2, p*3)`**:\n  - Like `dbl_triple_b`, the parentheses explicitly define the tuple. This is often preferred for clarity when returning multiple values, as it makes the intention to return a tuple explicit.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nFor single-value returns, you might prefer the style without unnecessary parentheses (`dbl_a`). For multiple values, using parentheses (`dbl_triple_b` or `dbl_triple_c`) can enhance clarity by explicitly indicating that a tuple is being returned, though it's not strictly necessary.\n\nIn both cases, the choice boils down to readability and coding style preferences. There are no side effects or functional differences in the return statements themselves. It would be beneficial to maintain consistency throughout your codebase for readability and maintainability."
