Given the dictionary `d = {'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3}`, I need to return `{'a':1, 'b':2}`. I have tried `d.pop('c')` but it returns the key value - 3 - instead of the dictionary. I need a one-function solution because this will be used in comprehensions."

        "content": "To remove a key from a dictionary and return the modified dictionary in a single function call, you can use a dictionary comprehension. This approach creates a new dictionary that includes only the keys you want to keep.\n\nHere's how you can do it for your specific case:\n\n```python\nd = {'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3}\nd = {key: value for key, value in d.items() if key != 'c'}\nprint(d)\n```\n\nThis comprehension iterates over the items of the dictionary `d` and constructs a new dictionary that only includes the key-value pairs where the key is not `'c'`. This way, you get the modified dictionary `{'a': 1, 'b': 2}` in a single line of code, which can be used directly in comprehensions."
