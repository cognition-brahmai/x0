For instance, given a list 'l' such as [1, 2, 3], I want to multiply each element by 2 to get [2, 4, 6]. I have found solutions online that multiply all the integers with each other to get a single output, like [1*2*3], but that's not what I want."

        "content": "To multiply each element of a list by a constant number in Python, you can use a list comprehension or a loop. Here's how you can do it using both methods:\n\n### Using List Comprehension:\n\n```python\nl = [1, 2, 3]\nconstant = 2\nresult = [x * constant for x in l]\nprint(result)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]\n```\n\n### Using a Loop:\n\n```python\nl = [1, 2, 3]\nconstant = 2\nresult = []\n\nfor x in l:\n    result.append(x * constant)\n\nprint(result)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]\n```\n\nBoth methods will give you the desired result, which is a new list with each element of the original list multiplied by the constant."
