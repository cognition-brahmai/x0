When I run my code, it throws an exception 'AttributeError: 'super' object has no attribute 'some_var''. What is the correct way to access variables from the base class?\n\nHere is the code I am trying to run:\n\n```\nclass Parent(object):\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.some_var = value\n\nclass Child(Parent):\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        super(Child, self).__init__(value)\n\n    def doSomething(self):\n        parent_var = super(Child, self).some_var\n\nobj = Child(123)\nobj.doSomething()\n```\n\nAnd the stack trace is as follows:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"test.py\", line 13, in <module>\n    obj.doSomething()\n  File \"test.py\", line 10, in doSomething\n    parent_var = super(Child, self).some_var\nAttributeError: 'super' object has no attribute 'some_var'\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is due to the incorrect usage of `super()`. The `super()` function is used to call methods from the parent class, but it doesn't directly allow you to access instance variables like `some_var`. Instead, you should access the instance variable directly from the instance itself (`self`), which has inherited it from the parent class. Here's how you can modify your code to fix the error:\n\n```python\nclass Parent(object):\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.some_var = value\n\nclass Child(Parent):\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        super(Child, self).__init__(value)\n\n    def doSomething(self):\n        # Access the inherited variable directly using self\n        parent_var = self.some_var\n        print(parent_var)  # Optionally print or use the variable\n\nobj = Child(123)\nobj.doSomething()\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, `self.some_var` is used to access the `some_var` attribute, which is inherited from the `Parent` class. This should resolve the `AttributeError` you were encountering."
