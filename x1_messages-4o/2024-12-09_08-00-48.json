        "content": "To measure the execution time of individual Python unit tests when using `nosetests`, you can use the `nose-timer` plugin. This plugin provides detailed timing information for each test. Here's how you can set it up and use it:\n\n1. **Install `nose-timer`:** First, you'll need to install the `nose-timer` plugin. You can do this using `pip`:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install nose-timer\n   ```\n\n2. **Run `nosetests` with `nose-timer`:** Once the plugin is installed, you can run your tests with the `--with-timer` option to enable timing:\n\n   ```bash\n   nosetests --with-timer\n   ```\n\n   This will output the execution time for each test along with the usual test results.\n\n3. **Additional Options:** `nose-timer` provides several options to customize its behavior. Some useful ones include:\n\n   - `--timer-top-n`: Show only the top N slowest tests.\n   - `--timer-ok`: Show timing for tests that pass as well as those that fail.\n   - `--timer-warning`: Set a threshold in seconds; tests that take longer will be highlighted.\n\n   For example, to show the top 5 slowest tests, you would run:\n\n   ```bash\n   nosetests --with-timer --timer-top-n 5\n   ```\n\nUsing `nose-timer` can help you identify slow tests, allowing you to optimize your test suite for better performance."
