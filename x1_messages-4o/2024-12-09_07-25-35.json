You can achieve this by calculating the absolute difference between each number in the list and the input number, and then selecting the number with the smallest difference. Here's a simple Python example to demonstrate this:\n\n```python\ndef find_closest_number(lst, input_number):\n    closest_number = lst[0]\n    smallest_difference = abs(lst[0] - input_number)\n\n    for number in lst:\n        current_difference = abs(number - input_number)\n        if current_difference < smallest_difference:\n            smallest_difference = current_difference\n            closest_number = number\n\n    return closest_number\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [4, 1, 88, 44, 3]\ninput_number = 5\nclosest_number = find_closest_number(numbers, input_number)\nprint(\"The closest number to\", input_number, \"is\", closest_number)\n```\n\nRunning this code will output:\n```\nThe closest number to 5 is 4\n```\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the number closest to the input number by iterating through the list only once."
