        "content": "I have a question regarding the application of Gaussian kernel in Support Vector Machines (SVM). According to the Wikipedia page on SVMs, if the kernel used is a Gaussian radial basis function, the resulting feature space is a Hilbert space of infinite dimensions. However, based on my understanding, the resulting feature space should be m-dimensional, where m is the number of training samples. This is because the landmarks are chosen to be the training examples, and the similarity between a specific example and all the examples is measured using the Gaussian kernel. For a single example, there are as many similarity values as training examples, which should result in new feature vectors that are m-dimensional, not infinite. Can someone explain why the Gaussian radial basis function maps the examples into an infinite-dimensional space?"

        "content": "The confusion arises from the difference between the conceptual feature space and the practical computations involved in using a Gaussian kernel in Support Vector Machines (SVM).\n\n1. **Conceptual Feature Space:**\n   - The Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernel is mathematically defined as \\( K(x, x') = \\exp(-\\gamma \\|x - x'\\|^2) \\).\n   - In theory, the Gaussian kernel implicitly maps the input data into an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. This is because the kernel function is a positive definite function, and, according to Mercer's theorem, it corresponds to an inner product in some high-dimensional or infinite-dimensional space.\n   - The reason it is considered infinite-dimensional is that the Gaussian function can be expanded into an infinite series of basis functions in Hilbert space, similar to how a Fourier series represents a function as an infinite sum of sines and cosines.\n\n2. **Practical Computation:**\n   - In practice, when you use the Gaussian kernel in SVMs, you don't explicitly compute the coordinates in this infinite-dimensional space. Instead, you compute the kernel matrix (also known as the Gram matrix) directly using the kernel function.\n   - This matrix is \\( m \\times m \\), where \\( m \\) is the number of training samples. Each entry in the matrix represents the similarity between a pair of training samples as computed by the Gaussian kernel.\n   - The SVM algorithm uses this kernel matrix to find the optimal hyperplane in the dual space, without ever needing to explicitly deal with the infinite dimensions.\n\nIn summary, while the Gaussian RBF kernel theoretically maps data to an infinite-dimensional space, the actual computations performed by the SVM involve only the finite-dimensional kernel matrix. This allows the SVM to leverage the high-dimensional mapping without the computational burden of explicitly working in an infinite-dimensional space."
