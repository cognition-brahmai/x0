When I index the byte-string, I get an integer value instead of a byte. For instance, when I run the following code:\n\n```python\nmy_bytes = b'just a byte string'\nprint(my_bytes[0])\nprint(type(my_bytes[0]))\n```\n\nThe output is `106` and `<class 'int'>` respectively. I was expecting the output to be `b'j'`. However, I discovered that I can get the expected value using a different approach as shown below:\n\n```python\nprint(my_bytes[0:1])\n```\n\nThis gives me `b'j'`. But this seems more like a hack to me. Can someone explain why this happens?"

        "content": "In Python 3, byte-strings (or `bytes` objects) are sequences of bytes, and each byte is represented by an integer value ranging from 0 to 255. This behavior is different from Python 2, where indexing a byte-string would return a one-character byte-string.\n\nWhen you index a `bytes` object with a single index, like `my_bytes[0]`, you're accessing the raw byte at that position, which is why you get an integer. In your example, `b'j'` is represented by the integer `106`, which is the ASCII value of the character 'j'.\n\nThe slice operation `my_bytes[0:1]` returns a new `bytes` object, which is why you see `b'j'`. This is not a hack; it's just taking advantage of slicing to obtain a `bytes` object that represents a single byte.\n\nIf you consistently need the single-byte `bytes` object rather than an integer, using slicing as you did with `my_bytes[0:1]` is the correct approach. Alternatively, if you want to convert the integer back to a byte-string, you can use:\n\n```python\nbyte_value = bytes([my_bytes[0]])\nprint(byte_value)  # Output: b'j'\n```\n\nThis approach explicitly constructs a `bytes` object from a list containing the integer value, effectively converting it back to a single-byte string."
