After launching a Jupyter notebook on my browser at 192.168.99.100:8888, I am able to run the tutorial notebooks without any problems. However, when I attempt to import the pandas library using `import pandas as pd`, which is installed on my computer via pip, I receive an `ImportError: No module named pandas` in Jupyter. How can I make the pandas library work inside the TensorFlow images launched from Docker?"

        "content": "When you're running Jupyter notebooks inside a Docker container, the Python environment inside the container is isolated from the Python environment on your host machine. This means that any Python packages you have installed on your host machine, including pandas, are not available inside the container unless they are also installed there.\n\nTo resolve the `ImportError: No module named pandas`, you need to install pandas inside the Docker container. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Access the Running Container**: First, you'll need to access the running Docker container where Jupyter is running. You can do this by executing the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   docker ps\n   ```\n\n   This command lists all running containers. Find the container ID or name of the container running Jupyter.\n\n2. **Install pandas Inside the Container**: Use the Docker exec command to install pandas inside the container. Replace `<container_id_or_name>` with the actual ID or name of your container:\n\n   ```bash\n   docker exec -it <container_id_or_name> bash\n   ```\n\n   This command opens a bash shell inside the container. Now, you can install pandas using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pandas\n   ```\n\n3. **Exit the Container**: After pandas is installed, you can exit the container's bash shell:\n\n   ```bash\n   exit\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify Installation**: Go back to your Jupyter notebook and try importing pandas again:\n\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n   ```\n\n   This should work without any ImportErrors.\n\nAlternatively, you can modify the Dockerfile or the docker-compose.yml (if you're using Docker Compose) to include pandas in the image build process, ensuring it is available whenever the container is started. Here's a simple example of how you might modify a Dockerfile to include pandas:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-jupyter\n\n# Install pandas\nRUN pip install pandas\n```\n\nAfter modifying the Dockerfile, rebuild your Docker image and restart your container:\n\n```bash\ndocker build -t my_tensorflow_image .\ndocker run -p 8888:8888 my_tensorflow_image\n```\n\nThis will ensure that pandas is installed every time you create a container from this image."
