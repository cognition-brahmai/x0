For example, if I have the following list:\n\n```python\nli = [\"a\", \"b\", \"a\", \"c\", \"x\", \"d\", \"a\", \"6\"]\n```\nI'm looking for a method or function to identify the index of the last occurrence of \"a\" in the given list. Is there a built-in function in Python that can accomplish this?"

        "content": "To find the last occurrence of a specific item in a Python list, you can use the `list` method `reverse()` in combination with `index()`. However, since `index()` returns the first occurrence, you can reverse the list and then calculate the position based on the original list length. Here's a simple way to do it:\n\n```python\nli = [\"a\", \"b\", \"a\", \"c\", \"x\", \"d\", \"a\", \"6\"]\n\n# The item to find\nitem = \"a\"\n\n# Reverse the list and find the index in the reversed list\nreversed_index = li[::-1].index(item)\n\n# Calculate the index in the original list\nindex = len(li) - 1 - reversed_index\n\nprint(\"The last occurrence of\", item, \"is at index:\", index)\n```\n\nThis code will correctly output:\n\n```\nThe last occurrence of a is at index: 6\n```\n\nThis approach works well and efficiently finds the last occurrence of an item without requiring a built-in method specifically for this purpose."
