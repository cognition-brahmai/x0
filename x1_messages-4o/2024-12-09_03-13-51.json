        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"ValueError: Data cardinality is ambiguous,\" typically occurs when the input features (x) and the target labels (y) do not have matching dimensions. In your case, the error message indicates that your input data (x) has a size of 3, while your target data (y) has a size of 6102. This discrepancy is likely causing the issue.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to resolve this problem:\n\n1. **Check Input Data:**\n   - Ensure that your input data (x) is in the correct format and that it matches the expected dimensions. Typically, for training a model, x should be a NumPy array or a TensorFlow dataset with a shape like `(num_samples, ...other_dimensions...)`.\n\n2. **Check Target Data:**\n   - Similarly, ensure that your target data (y) is correctly formatted. It should be a NumPy array or a TensorFlow dataset with a shape like `(num_samples, num_classes)` for multi-class classification.\n\n3. **Verify Data Preparation:**\n   - Check the data preparation step where you split or transform your dataset. Ensure that both x and y are derived from the same dataset and have the same number of samples.\n\n4. **Batching and Dataset Construction:**\n   - If you're using a `tf.data.Dataset` for batching, ensure that the dataset is constructed correctly. The dataset should return tuples of (x, y) with aligned first dimensions.\n\n5. **Inspect Data Shapes:**\n   - Print out the shapes of x and y before passing them into the model to confirm that they align. Use `print(x.shape)` and `print(y.shape)` to debug.\n\n6. **Adjusting Data:**\n   - If you find a mismatch, you'll need to adjust either your input data or your labels so that their first dimensions (number of samples) match.\n\n7. **Check Model Input:**\n   - Ensure that the model is expecting inputs of the correct shape. Double-check the input layer of your BERT model to make sure it aligns with your x data.\n\n8. **Debugging:**\n   - Go back through your data pipeline to check for any transformations or operations that might have altered the data dimensions unexpectedly.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify where the cardinality mismatch occurs and make the necessary adjustments to resolve the error."
