        "content": "Yes, you can configure the PyDev debugger in Eclipse to break or pause execution when an exception occurs. Here's how you can set it up:\n\n1. **Open Eclipse**: Launch your Eclipse IDE where PyDev is installed.\n\n2. **Access PyDev Preferences**:\n   - Go to `Window` > `Preferences` (or `Eclipse` > `Preferences` on macOS).\n   - In the Preferences window, expand the `PyDev` section on the left panel.\n\n3. **Configure Exception Breakpoints**:\n   - Under the PyDev section, navigate to `Debug`.\n   - Here, you will find options related to debugging, including exception handling.\n\n4. **Set Breakpoint on Exceptions**:\n   - Look for the option labeled \"Suspend on uncaught exceptions\" and make sure it is checked. This will cause the debugger to pause execution when an uncaught exception is encountered.\n   - If you want the debugger to also pause on caught exceptions, you can check \"Suspend on caught exceptions\" as well, though this might result in more frequent pauses.\n\n5. **Apply and Close**:\n   - Click `Apply` and then `OK` to save your changes and exit the Preferences window.\n\n6. **Test Your Configuration**:\n   - Run your Python script in debug mode: Right-click on your script in the Project Explorer, go to `Debug As` > `Python Run`.\n   - If an exception occurs, the debugger should now pause execution, allowing you to inspect variables, the call stack, and troubleshoot the issue.\n\nBy setting up these options, you can efficiently debug your Python programs using PyDev by breaking execution when exceptions occur."
