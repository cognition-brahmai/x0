I have been trying to work through some of the Dive Into Python examples and I'm encountering a problem when I try to import a module. I have a file named `odbchelper.py` located at `/Desktop/Python_Tutorials/diveintopython/py`. In my `example.py` file in my PyDev/Eclipse project, I have the following code:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nsys.path.append(\"~/Desktop/Python_Tutorials/diveintopython/py\")\n```\n\nThis works fine, but when I try to import `odbchelper` as follows:\n\n```python\nimport odbchelper\n```\n\nI get an unresolved import error. I tried adding `__init__.py` files to several directories but it doesn't help. I'd like to have a project in another directory, say `/Desktop/MyStuff/Project`, in which I have `example.py` and then from `example.py` I want to import `odbchelper.py` from `/Desktop/Python_Tutorials/diveintopython/py/`. I've been advised to use `sys.path.append()` to add this directory to my path, and then import it, which is what I am doing, but it's not working. I also tried the `Ctrl-1` trick to suppress the error message, but the program still doesn't function correctly. I get an error: `ImportError: No module named odbchelper`. It's frustrating that I can't import a module from a file in another directory on my machine. How can I fix this?"

        "content": "To resolve the issue, let's go through a few steps to ensure that the module can be imported successfully:\n\n1. **Absolute Path in `sys.path.append`**: The problem might be caused by the use of a tilde (`~`) in your path, which is a shorthand for the home directory in Unix-like systems. Python's `sys.path.append` may not correctly interpret this. You should replace it with the full path. Use the following line in your `example.py`:\n\n    ```python\n    sys.path.append(\"/home/your_username/Desktop/Python_Tutorials/diveintopython/py\")\n    ```\n\n   Make sure to replace `your_username` with your actual username.\n\n2. **Verify File Location**: Double-check that the `odbchelper.py` file is indeed located at `/home/your_username/Desktop/Python_Tutorials/diveintopython/py/`.\n\n3. **Check Python Version**: Make sure that the Python version you're using in Eclipse/PyDev is the same as the one you use from the command line, as differences might affect module importing.\n\n4. **Eclipse/PyDev Configuration**: Ensure that your PyDev project is correctly configured:\n   - Right-click on your project in the Project Explorer.\n   - Go to **Properties > PyDev - PYTHONPATH**.\n   - Make sure that the external library path (where `odbchelper.py` is located) is added to the PYTHONPATH.\n\n5. **Environment Variables**: Make sure there are no conflicting environment variables that might be affecting the Python path.\n\n6. **Eclipse Restart**: Sometimes, restarting Eclipse can help in applying the changes.\n\n7. **Testing Outside Eclipse**: As a sanity check, try running your script from the command line to see if the import works outside of Eclipse:\n\n    ```bash\n    python /path/to/your/example.py\n    ```\n\n    This can help determine if the issue is specific to your Eclipse/PyDev setup.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the import error and successfully import `odbchelper.py` into your `example.py`."
