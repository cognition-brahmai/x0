This function returns a list of strings representing the names of the object's attributes and methods. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\n# Example object\nclass Example:\n    def method_one(self):\n        pass\n\n    def method_two(self):\n        pass\n\n# Create an instance of the class\nexample_obj = Example()\n\n# Get a list of all attributes and methods of the object\nall_methods = dir(example_obj)\n\n# Print the list\nprint(all_methods)\n```\n\nThis will include all methods, including special methods (those surrounded by double underscores, like `__init__`) and attributes.\n\nIf you want to check whether a specific method exists in an object, you can use the `hasattr()` function. This function checks if an object has an attribute with a given name and returns `True` or `False`. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\n# Check if the object has a specific method\nmethod_exists = hasattr(example_obj, 'method_one')\nprint(method_exists)  # Output: True if 'method_one' exists, otherwise False\n```\n\nThese methods provide a straightforward way to inspect an object's attributes and methods without causing any errors."
