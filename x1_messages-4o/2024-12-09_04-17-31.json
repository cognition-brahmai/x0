I attempted to retrieve the first row from a worksheet with a subscript but it resulted in a TypeError: 'generator' object is not subscriptable. Here is the code I tried:\n\n```python\n# after getting filename\n# after loading worksheet\n# to get the first row of the worksheet\nfirst_row = worksheet.rows[0]\n```\n\nThis resulted in the following error:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n      File \"<pyshell#54>\", line 1, in <module>\n      first_row = phc_th_sheet.rows[1]\nTypeError: 'generator' object is not subscriptable\n```\n\nI also tried the following alternatives:\n\n```python\nfirst_row = worksheet.(row=1)\n# and\nfirst_row = worksheet.rows[:1]\n```\n\nBut neither of these worked. I've checked the openpyxl documentation at https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/default/ but haven't found any useful information on how to select rows by index. Is there a way to accomplish this in openpyxl?"

        "content": "To retrieve a specific row by index using Openpyxl, you need to understand that `worksheet.rows` is indeed a generator. Generators in Python do not support indexing, which is why you're encountering the `TypeError`.\n\nTo access a specific row by index, you can convert the generator into a list and then access the desired row. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom openpyxl import load_workbook\n\n# Load the workbook and select the worksheet\nworkbook = load_workbook('your_file.xlsx')\nworksheet = workbook.active  # or workbook['SheetName'] for a specific sheet\n\n# Convert the rows generator to a list and get the first row\nfirst_row = list(worksheet.rows)[0]\n\n# To access the values in the first row, you can iterate over the row\nfor cell in first_row:\n    print(cell.value)\n```\n\nThis code will load your workbook, access the active worksheet (or a specific sheet by name), convert the rows generator to a list, and then retrieve the first row by index. You can then iterate over the cells in the row to access their values.\n\nIf you're working with large worksheets, converting the entire generator to a list might not be efficient. In such cases, it's better to iterate through the generator until you reach the desired row:\n\n```python\nfrom openpyxl import load_workbook\n\n# Load the workbook and select the worksheet\nworkbook = load_workbook('your_file.xlsx')\nworksheet = workbook.active  # or workbook['SheetName'] for a specific sheet\n\n# Initialize a counter\nrow_index = 0\n\n# Iterate through the rows\nfor row in worksheet.iter_rows():\n    if row_index == 0:  # Modify this index to get the desired row\n        first_row = row\n        break\n    row_index += 1\n\n# Access the values in the first row\nfor cell in first_row:\n    print(cell.value)\n```\n\nThis approach is more memory efficient for large worksheets as it doesn't load all rows into memory at once."
