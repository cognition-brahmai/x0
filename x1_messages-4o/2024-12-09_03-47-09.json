I am currently using the DateTime type of SQLAlchemy with timezone=True argument. However, when I try to save a non-naive datetime object to the database and return it, it comes back as naive. I have tried using pytz to make the datetime object non-naive, but the issue persists. Also, when I use datetime.datetime.utcnow as default, it is a naive time that would accept a naive localtime-based datetime, even though I've used timezone=True with it. I am looking for a way to set a base timezone to normalize it with."

        "content": "To handle timezones effectively with SQLAlchemy, especially when dealing with UTC, you need to ensure that the datetime objects you are working with are timezone-aware both when storing and retrieving data. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Ensure Datetime Objects Are Timezone-Aware**:\n   Use the `pytz` or `zoneinfo` (Python 3.9+) libraries to make your datetime objects timezone-aware before storing them in the database.\n\n   ```python\n   from datetime import datetime\n   import pytz\n\n   # Using pytz\n   utc = pytz.utc\n   aware_datetime = utc.localize(datetime.utcnow())\n   ```\n\n   ```python\n   from datetime import datetime\n   from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo\n\n   # Using zoneinfo\n   aware_datetime = datetime.now(ZoneInfo(\"UTC\"))\n   ```\n\n2. **Configure SQLAlchemy to Handle Timezones**:\n   Ensure that your SQLAlchemy model is set to handle timezone-aware datetime objects. With `timezone=True`, SQLAlchemy will store the datetime in the timezone-aware format.\n\n   ```python\n   from sqlalchemy import Column, DateTime, create_engine, Integer\n   from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\n\n   Base = declarative_base()\n\n   class MyModel(Base):\n       __tablename__ = 'my_model'\n       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n       timestamp = Column(DateTime(timezone=True))\n\n   # Create an engine and bind it to the Base\n   engine = create_engine('postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname')\n   Base.metadata.create_all(engine)\n   ```\n\n3. **Ensure Database and ORM Timezone Compatibility**:\n   Make sure your database is configured to handle timezones properly. For PostgreSQL, for instance, you usually want to use `TIMESTAMPTZ` for this.\n\n4. **Setting Default Values**:\n   If you want to use `datetime.datetime.utcnow` as a default value, you should wrap it in a function that returns a timezone-aware datetime.\n\n   ```python\n   from sqlalchemy.sql import func\n\n   class MyModel(Base):\n       __tablename__ = 'my_model'\n       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n       timestamp = Column(DateTime(timezone=True), default=lambda: utc.localize(datetime.utcnow()))\n   ```\n\n5. **Retrieving Datetime Objects**:\n   When you retrieve datetime objects from the database, they should remain timezone-aware if everything is configured correctly. Always check and adjust them if necessary.\n\n6. **Handling Naive Datetime**:\n   If you encounter naive datetimes, convert them to a timezone-aware format as soon as possible.\n\n   ```python\n   naive_datetime = datetime.utcnow()\n   aware_datetime = utc.localize(naive_datetime)\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to handle timezones effectively with SQLAlchemy and ensure that all your datetime objects are stored and retrieved as timezone-aware UTC times."
