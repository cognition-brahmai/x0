        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to the formatter you're using in Visual Studio Code, which is \"Black.\" Black is a code formatter for Python that's known for its strictness and making code formatting decisions for you. However, Black does not support formatting a selected portion of code (\"Format Selection\"), but rather formats entire files at once. This is why you're seeing the error message.\n\nHere\u2019s what you can do to resolve the situation:\n\n1. **Format the Entire File**: Since Black only formats entire files, you can use the formatting shortcut without selecting any specific text. Just place your cursor anywhere in the file and use `Shift + Alt + F` (or your OS equivalent) to format the whole file.\n\n2. **Use a Different Formatter for Selection**: If you really need to format only a selection of your code, you could switch to a different formatter that supports this feature. Some popular formatters that do support \"Format Selection\" include:\n   - **autopep8**: You can set this as your default formatter in VS Code. To do so, go to your VS Code settings (`Ctrl + ,`), search for \"Python Formatting Provider,\" and set it to `autopep8`.\n   - **YAPF**: Another formatter that supports formatting selections. Similar to autopep8, you can set it up in your VS Code settings.\n\n3. **Configure Black to Work with VS Code**: If you still prefer using Black but want to avoid the error, you can configure your settings to avoid attempting to format selections. You can do this by setting it only to format on save or by not using the \"Format Selection\" option.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can change the formatter in VS Code:\n\n- Open your Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P`).\n- Type `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)` and select it.\n- Add or modify the following configuration to specify a different formatter:\n\n  ```json\n  \"python.formatting.provider\": \"autopep8\",\n  ```\n\nYou can change `\"autopep8\"` to `\"yapf\"` if you prefer using YAPF. Save the settings and try formatting your selection again."
