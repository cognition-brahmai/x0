I am trying to set borders to certain cells to form a grid for the table. Here is the code I am currently using:\n\n```python\nformat6 = excelbook.add_format()\nformat6.set_left(1)\nfor y in range(24):\n    excel.write(y+5, 1, None, format6)\n```\nHowever, due to the complex layout of the table, it would be easier to first write the data and then apply the format to the cells to create the borders. I can't seem to find a way to do this. Is there any method to apply format to a cell after it has been written without losing its current content?"

        "content": "Yes, you can certainly apply formatting to cells after writing the data without losing the content. In XlsxWriter, the format applied to a cell does not overwrite the cell's content. You can do this by simply using the `write` method again on the same cell with the new format, while specifying the current content of the cell. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n1. First, write your data to the cells as you normally would.\n2. Then, iterate over the cells you want to apply the formatting to, retrieving the current content of the cell and re-writing it with the new format.\n\nHere's an example of how you can apply a border format to specific cells after writing the data:\n\n```python\nimport xlsxwriter\n\n# Create a workbook and add a worksheet.\nworkbook = xlsxwriter.Workbook('formatted_table.xlsx')\nworksheet = workbook.add_worksheet()\n\n# Sample data to be written to the worksheet.\ndata = [\n    ['Header1', 'Header2', 'Header3'],\n    [1, 2, 3],\n    [4, 5, 6],\n    [7, 8, 9]\n]\n\n# Write data to the worksheet.\nfor row_num, row_data in enumerate(data):\n    worksheet.write_row(row_num, 0, row_data)\n\n# Define a format with borders\nborder_format = workbook.add_format({'border': 1})\n\n# Apply the border format to a specific range of cells.\n# This example applies the border to the entire table including headers.\nfor row_num in range(len(data)):\n    for col_num in range(len(data[0])):\n        # Re-write the cell content with the border format\n        worksheet.write(row_num, col_num, data[row_num][col_num], border_format)\n\n# Close the workbook to save the file.\nworkbook.close()\n```\n\nIn this example, we first write the data to the worksheet. Then, we define a format with borders using `workbook.add_format({'border': 1})`. Finally, we loop through the range of cells we want to format, re-writing each cell with its current content and the new format applied.\n\nThis approach ensures that the data remains intact while applying the desired formatting."
