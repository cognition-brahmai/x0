Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfilename = 'your_script.py'\nwith open(filename, 'r') as file:\n    code = file.read()\nexec(code)\n```\n\nThis code opens the target Python file, reads its contents into a string, and then executes the string as Python code using `exec`.\n\nAdditionally, if you want to execute the file within a specific namespace (i.e., a dictionary of variables), you can do so by passing dictionaries to the `exec` function:\n\n```python\nfilename = 'your_script.py'\nwith open(filename, 'r') as file:\n    code = file.read()\n\nglobals_dict = {}  # or populate with desired global variables\nlocals_dict = {}   # or populate with desired local variables\n\nexec(code, globals_dict, locals_dict)\n```\n\nThis way, you can control the environment in which the script is executed, which can help prevent unwanted side effects or conflicts with the surrounding code."
