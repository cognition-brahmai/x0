I don't understand why both `x` and `y` need to be stated before the `:`. I also want to know how to make it return multiple arguments. I've used lambda in the command argument of a button, like so: `self.buttonAdd_1 = Button(self, text='+', command=lambda : self.calculate(self.buttonOut_1.grid_info(), 1))`, which works just fine. However, when I try to use the same syntax with `self.entry_1.bind(\"<Return>\", lambda : self.calculate(self.buttonOut_1.grid_info(), 1))`, I get a TypeError: `() takes no arguments (1 given)`. Could you explain how to correctly use lambda in these situations?"

Let's break down the usage of `lambda` in Python and address the issues you're encountering.\n\n### Understanding `lambda` Functions\n\nA `lambda` function in Python is a small anonymous function that is defined using the `lambda` keyword. It can take any number of arguments but contains only a single expression. The syntax is:\n\n```python\nlambda arguments: expression\n```\n\n- **Arguments**: This is where you list the parameters that the lambda function will accept.\n- **Expression**: This is a single expression that the lambda function evaluates and returns. \n\n### Passing Multiple Arguments\n\nWhen you see `lambda x, y: x + y`, it means you are creating a function that takes two arguments `x` and `y`, and returns their sum. Both `x` and `y` need to be listed before the `:` because you are defining the inputs to your lambda function.\n\n### Returning Multiple Values\n\nLambda functions can only contain one expression, but you can return a tuple if you need to return multiple values:\n\n```python\nlambda x, y: (x + y, x - y)\n```\n\nThis would return a tuple with the sum and difference of `x` and `y`.\n\n### Using `lambda` with Tkinter\n\nIn Tkinter, when you bind an event to a widget, the event handler typically receives an event object as an implicit argument. This is why you're seeing a `TypeError` when using `lambda` with `bind`.\n\n```python\nself.entry_1.bind(\"<Return>\", lambda event: self.calculate(self.buttonOut_1.grid_info(), 1))\n```\n\nIn this corrected example, the `lambda` function now accepts `event` as an argument. This is necessary because the `bind` method passes the event object to the callback function when the event occurs.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's clarify with an example:\n\n```python\nfrom tkinter import Tk, Button, Entry\n\nclass MyApp:\n    def __init__(self, root):\n        self.buttonAdd_1 = Button(root, text='+', command=lambda: self.calculate(self.buttonOut_1.grid_info(), 1))\n        self.buttonAdd_1.pack()\n\n        self.entry_1 = Entry(root)\n        self.entry_1.pack()\n        self.entry_1.bind(\"<Return>\", lambda event: self.calculate(self.buttonOut_1.grid_info(), 1))\n\n    def calculate(self, info, number):\n        print(\"Grid info:\", info)\n        print(\"Number:\", number)\n\nroot = Tk()\napp = MyApp(root)\nroot.mainloop()\n```\n\nIn this setup, the `lambda` used in `bind` accepts an `event` parameter to prevent the `TypeError`. This allows your `calculate` function to be called correctly when the Return key is pressed."
