I have confirmed the response is encoded in latin1 by running `r.encoding`, which returned `ISO-859-1`. However, when I attempt to decode it using the following code:\n\n```python\nr = response.content\nstring = r.decode(\"ISO-8859-1\")\nprint (string)\n```\nIt prints a blank line. Despite this, when I run `len(string)`, it returns `31023`. How can I decode these bytes without getting back an empty string?"

        "content": "If decoding the response using `ISO-8859-1` results in a string with length but appears blank when printed, it's possible that the content includes non-printable characters or control characters that aren't visible in a standard print statement.\n\nHere's what you can do to investigate and handle the situation:\n\n1. **Check for Non-Printable Characters:**\n   Try printing a portion of the string or using a loop to print only printable characters. This can give you a better idea of the content.\n\n   ```python\n   string = r.decode(\"ISO-8859-1\")\n   \n   # Print a portion of the string\n   print(string[:500])  # Adjust the slice to see more or less\n\n   # Or print only printable characters\n   import string as str_module\n   printable_chars = set(str_module.printable)\n   print(''.join(filter(lambda x: x in printable_chars, string)))\n   ```\n\n2. **Inspect for Newline or Whitespace Characters:**\n   The content might have a lot of newline (`\\n`), carriage return (`\\r`), or whitespace characters. You can replace or remove these to see the actual content.\n\n   ```python\n   visible_content = string.replace('\\n', '').replace('\\r', '').strip()\n   print(visible_content[:500])  # Print a part of the visible content\n   ```\n\n3. **Convert and Examine JSON Structure:**\n   If the response is supposed to be JSON, you can try to load it using a JSON parser to see its structure.\n\n   ```python\n   import json\n\n   try:\n       json_data = json.loads(string)\n       print(json.dumps(json_data, indent=4))  # Pretty-print the JSON data\n   except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n       print(\"Failed to decode JSON:\", e)\n   ```\n\n4. **Hex Dump for Analysis:**\n   If you still can't see anything useful, consider printing a hex dump of the bytes to manually inspect the content for patterns.\n\n   ```python\n   print(r[:500].hex())  # Print a part of the bytes as hex\n   ```\n\n5. **Check for Compression:**\n   Sometimes, content is compressed, and you need to decompress it. Check headers to see if compression like `gzip` or `deflate` is used, and handle accordingly.\n\n   ```python\n   import zlib\n   import gzip\n   import io\n\n   # Check for 'Content-Encoding' in response headers\n   if 'gzip' in response.headers.get('Content-Encoding', ''):\n       with gzip.open(io.BytesIO(r), 'rb') as f:\n           decompressed_data = f.read()\n           string = decompressed_data.decode(\"ISO-8859-1\")\n           print(string[:500])  # Print a portion of the decompressed content\n   elif 'deflate' in response.headers.get('Content-Encoding', ''):\n       decompressed_data = zlib.decompress(r)\n       string = decompressed_data.decode(\"ISO-8859-1\")\n       print(string[:500])\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to gain more insight into the content of the response and how to process it further."
