I have made sure to use a compatible webdriver and Chrome version. The script I am using is supposed to open a webpage from the normal user data directory and provide a response. Here's the script:\n\n```python\nfrom seleniumwire import webdriver  # Import from seleniumwire\n\nchrome_options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()\nchrome_options.add_argument(\"user-data-dir=C:\\\\selenium\") \n\ndriver = webdriver.Chrome(chrome_options=chrome_options)\n\ndriver.get('https://katalon.com/')\n\nfor request in driver.requests:\n    if request.response:\n        print(request.response.status_code)\n```\n\nAnd the error message I am receiving is:\n\n```python\nselenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Message: unknown error: cannot determine loading status\nfrom unknown error: unexpected command response\n  (Session info: chrome=103.0.5060.53)\n```\n\nHow can I resolve this issue?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error message you're encountering, \"unknown error: cannot determine loading status\" and \"unknown error: unexpected command response,\" typically indicates a problem with the way the Selenium WebDriver is interacting with the browser. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Update Chrome and WebDriver:**\n   - Ensure both Google Chrome and the ChromeDriver are updated to the latest versions. Since you mentioned using Chrome version 103, verify that you have the corresponding ChromeDriver version 103.0.5060.53. If Chrome has been updated, ensure that the ChromeDriver is also updated accordingly.\n\n2. **Check Chrome Options:**\n   - The `user-data-dir` argument should be specified correctly. Make sure the path is correct and that you have the necessary permissions to access this directory. Sometimes, clearing the user data directory or specifying a different, fresh directory can help.\n\n3. **Reinstall Selenium and Selenium-Wire:**\n   - Sometimes, library conflicts or corruption can cause issues. Try reinstalling Selenium and Selenium-Wire using pip:\n     ```bash\n     pip uninstall selenium selenium-wire\n     pip install selenium selenium-wire\n     ```\n\n4. **Use Correct ChromeOptions Syntax:**\n   - Ensure that you are using the correct syntax for passing options. The following line should be updated to:\n     ```python\n     driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=chrome_options)\n     ```\n\n5. **Check for Interference:**\n   - Ensure no other application or process is interfering with the browser session. Sometimes antivirus software or other browser extensions can cause issues.\n\n6. **Enable Logging for More Information:**\n   - Enable detailed logging to gather more information about what might be going wrong:\n     ```python\n     chrome_options.add_argument(\"--enable-logging\")\n     chrome_options.add_argument(\"--v=1\")\n     ```\n\n7. **Use a Clean User Profile:**\n   - Try running the script without the `user-data-dir` option to see if a clean profile works:\n     ```python\n     chrome_options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()\n     # chrome_options.add_argument(\"user-data-dir=C:\\\\selenium\")  # Comment this out\n     ```\n\n8. **Test Without Selenium-Wire:**\n   - Test the script without using Selenium-Wire to identify if the issue is related to Selenium-Wire:\n     ```python\n     from selenium import webdriver  # Use regular selenium\n\n     chrome_options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()\n     chrome_options.add_argument(\"user-data-dir=C:\\\\selenium\")\n\n     driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=chrome_options)\n\n     driver.get('https://katalon.com/')\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue. If the problem persists, consider creating a minimal reproducible example and sharing it along with detailed log output for further assistance."
