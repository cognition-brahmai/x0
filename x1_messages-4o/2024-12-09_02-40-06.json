Upon checking the service status using `$ systemctl status super-project.service`, I get an error that the module 'main' cannot be found. If I execute `$ super-project` from `/usr/local/bin/`, the script starts correctly but the configuration files cannot be read likely due to path issues. However, if I execute `$ super-project` from `top-folder` (folder containing the project code/files) the script runs perfectly. What could be the issue here?"

        "content": "Setting up a Python project to install and automatically create a systemd service can be tricky, especially when dealing with path issues. Let's go through what you need to check and correct to resolve this problem.\n\n### Project Structure\nFirst, ensure your project structure is well-organized. Here's a typical structure:\n\n```\ntop-folder/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 my_module/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 config/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 config.yaml\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 setup.py\n```\n\n### `setup.py` Configuration\nYour `setup.py` should properly define the entry point to your application. Here's a basic example:\n\n```python\nfrom setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\nsetup(\n    name='super-project',\n    version='0.1',\n    packages=find_packages(),\n    entry_points={\n        'console_scripts': [\n            'super-project=my_module.main:main_function',  # Adjust as needed\n        ],\n    },\n    data_files=[\n        ('/etc/super-project', ['config/config.yaml']),  # Adjust path as needed\n    ],\n)\n```\n\n### systemd Service File\nYour systemd service file, usually located in `/etc/systemd/system/super-project.service`, should look like this:\n\n```ini\n[Unit]\nDescription=Super Project Service\nAfter=network.target\n\n[Service]\nExecStart=/usr/local/bin/super-project\nWorkingDirectory=/etc/super-project\nUser=your_user\nGroup=your_group\nRestart=always\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\n### Path and Import Issues\n1. **Imports:** Ensure that your `main.py` file imports modules correctly. Use absolute imports or handle relative imports carefully.\n   ```python\n   # Inside main.py\n   import my_module  # if my_module is a directory\n   ```\n\n2. **File Paths:** If your script reads configuration files, ensure you are using paths relative to the script's location or specify absolute paths.\n   - Use Python's `os` module to construct paths dynamically.\n   ```python\n   import os\n\n   config_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'config', 'config.yaml')\n   ```\n\n3. **Working Directory:** The `WorkingDirectory` in your systemd service file is critical. It sets the directory from which the service runs. Ensure it's set to a directory where your script can access necessary resources.\n\n### Common Debugging Steps\n\n- **Permissions:** Ensure the user running the service has permissions to access all necessary files.\n- **Logging:** Add logging to your Python script to capture errors and information on file paths being accessed.\n- **Reload systemd:** After making changes to the service file, reload systemd and restart the service:\n  ```bash\n  sudo systemctl daemon-reload\n  sudo systemctl restart super-project.service\n  ```\n\n- **Check Logs:** Use `journalctl` to view logs and identify issues:\n  ```bash\n  journalctl -u super-project.service\n  ```\n\nBy following these steps and verifying each part of the setup, you should be able to resolve the path and import issues you're experiencing."
