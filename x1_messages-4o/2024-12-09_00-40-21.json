I found that the 'python-beautifulsoup' package seems suitable for this task. However, when searching for tutorials online, I noticed that 'python-bs4' is used instead. Both packages have the same description: 'python-bs4 - error-tolerant HTML parser for Python' and 'python-beautifulsoup - error-tolerant HTML parser for Python'. What is the difference between 'beautifulsoup' and 'bs4'?"

        "content": "The confusion between \"beautifulsoup\" and \"bs4\" often arises due to naming conventions and packaging. Here's a clarification:\n\n1. **Beautiful Soup**:\n   - Beautiful Soup is a Python library used for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates a parse tree for parsed pages that can be used to extract data from HTML, which is useful for web scraping.\n   - The library is known for its simplicity and ease of use, making it a popular choice for beginners and experts alike.\n\n2. **bs4**:\n   - The term \"bs4\" refers to the fourth major version of the Beautiful Soup library (Beautiful Soup 4).\n   - When you see \"bs4\" in the context of imports in Python, such as `from bs4 import BeautifulSoup`, it is referring to Beautiful Soup 4.\n   - The package name \"bs4\" is used when you install the library via pip: `pip install beautifulsoup4`. This installs the Beautiful Soup 4 library.\n\n3. **python-beautifulsoup vs. python-bs4**:\n   - These are likely package names provided by different distributions or packaging systems (such as apt in Debian/Ubuntu systems).\n   - \"python-beautifulsoup\" might refer to an earlier version of the library, such as Beautiful Soup 3, while \"python-bs4\" refers to Beautiful Soup 4.\n   - Beautiful Soup 4 (bs4) is the recommended version to use as it has more features and better support for modern HTML and XML parsing.\n\nIn summary, \"beautifulsoup\" and \"bs4\" are essentially the same library, with \"bs4\" specifically referring to Beautiful Soup version 4. For new projects, you should use Beautiful Soup 4 (bs4) by installing it with `pip install beautifulsoup4` and importing it with `from bs4 import BeautifulSoup`."
