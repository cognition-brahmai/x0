        "content": "The unexpected behavior you're encountering is due to the use of a mutable default argument in your function. In Python, default argument values are evaluated only once when the function is defined, not each time the function is called. This means that if you use a mutable default argument like a list, all calls to the function will share the same list object unless you explicitly provide a new one.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of what's happening in your code:\n\n1. **First Call to `f()`**: \n   - The list `l` is initialized to the default list `[]`.\n   - `len(l)` is 0, so `0` is appended to `l`.\n   - The function returns `[0]`.\n\n2. **Second Call to `f()`**: \n   - The same list `l` is reused.\n   - `len(l)` is now 1 (since the list already contains `[0]`), so `1` is appended to `l`.\n   - The function returns `[0, 1]`.\n\n3. **Third Call to `f()`**: \n   - Again, the same list `l` is reused.\n   - `len(l)` is now 2 (since the list contains `[0, 1]`), so `2` is appended to `l`.\n   - The function returns `[0, 1, 2]`.\n\nThat's why you get cumulative results in your outputs. To achieve the expected behavior where each call to `f()` operates on a fresh list, you should use `None` as the default value and initialize the list inside the function, like this:\n\n```python\ndef f(l=None):\n    if l is None:\n        l = []\n    l.append(len(l))\n    return l\n\n# Now, each call to f() uses a new list\nprint(f() + f() + f())  # -> [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2]\n```\n\nWith this change, each call to `f()` starts with a fresh, empty list, and you'll get the expected output."
