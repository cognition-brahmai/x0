        "content": "To detect the text area in an image and draw a rectangle around it using Python 2.7 and OpenCV 2.4.9, you can follow these steps. Note that the methods might not be as advanced as in newer versions, but you can still achieve decent results. Here's a basic approach:\n\n1. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have OpenCV installed. You can install it using pip if it's not already installed.\n   ```bash\n   pip install opencv-python==2.4.9\n   ```\n\n2. **Read the Image and Convert to Grayscale**: Start by loading the image and converting it to grayscale.\n\n3. **Apply Thresholding or Edge Detection**: Use methods like adaptive thresholding or Canny edge detection to highlight the text areas.\n\n4. **Find Contours**: Detect contours in the processed image. These contours will be used to identify potential text areas.\n\n5. **Filter Contours and Draw Rectangles**: Filter out contours that are too small or too large to be text and draw rectangles around the remaining contours.\n\nHere is a sample code implementing these steps:\n\n```python\nimport cv2\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Load the image\nimage = cv2.imread('input_image.jpg')\ngray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\n\n# Apply Gaussian Blur to reduce noise and improve contour detection\nblurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (5, 5), 0)\n\n# Apply thresholding\n_, thresh = cv2.threshold(blurred, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV + cv2.THRESH_OTSU)\n\n# Find contours\ncontours, _ = cv2.findContours(thresh, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)\n\n# Loop over contours and draw a rectangle around potential text areas\nfor contour in contours:\n    # Get bounding box for each contour\n    x, y, w, h = cv2.boundingRect(contour)\n    \n    # Filter contours by size to isolate likely text areas\n    if 100 < w < 1000 and 20 < h < 200:\n        cv2.rectangle(image, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 255, 0), 2)\n\n# Display the result\ncv2.imshow(\"Detected Text Areas\", image)\ncv2.waitKey(0)\ncv2.destroyAllWindows()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Gaussian Blur**: Helps in smoothing the image and reduces noise, which can improve the accuracy of contour detection.\n- **Thresholding**: Converts the image to a binary image, which makes it easier to find contours.\n- **Contour Detection**: Finds contours in the binary image, which are potential text regions.\n- **Bounding Rectangles**: Draws rectangles around detected text areas based on contour size.\n\n### Note:\n- **Thresholding Parameters**: You might need to adjust the thresholding parameters or method based on your specific image.\n- **Contour Filtering**: The size constraints for contours are arbitrary and may need adjustment to suit your image.\n\nThis code provides a basic start for detecting text areas in images using OpenCV 2.4.9. You may need to fine-tune parameters based on the specific characteristics of your images."
