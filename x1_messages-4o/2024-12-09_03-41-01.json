I have tried several regular expressions but with no success. For example, I tried the following code:\n\n```python\ns = \"This must not b3 delet3d, but the number at the end yes 134411\"\ns = re.sub(\"\\d+\", \"\", s)\nprint(s)\n```\n\nHowever, the result is \"This must not b deletd, but the number at the end yes\", which is not what I want. I want to delete only the standalone digits at the end, not the digits contained within the words."

        "content": "To delete only standalone digits from a string in Python using regular expressions, while keeping digits that are part of words intact, you can use word boundaries (`\\b`) in your regular expression. Word boundaries help in identifying standalone words or digits. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired outcome:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ns = \"This must not b3 delet3d, but the number at the end yes 134411\"\n# \\b\\d+\\b matches standalone digits\ns = re.sub(r\"\\b\\d+\\b\", \"\", s)\nprint(s)\n```\n\nHere's what the regex pattern `\\b\\d+\\b` does:\n\n- `\\b`: Asserts a word boundary. It helps in ensuring that the digits are not part of a word.\n- `\\d+`: Matches one or more digits.\n- `\\b`: Another word boundary to ensure the digits are standalone.\n\nWith this pattern, only the standalone digits will be removed, leaving digits within words untouched."
