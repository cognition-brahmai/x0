Your goal is to create a bouquet with a hue that can be created by mixing a secondary color with a primary color. However, the color you need cannot be green, orange or purple. \nTo make things more challenging, you can only pick flowers that are in odd-numbered positions and cannot pick the same flower twice. The positions start at 1 and go up to 19. Can you figure out which flowers to pick to create the desired hue? \nHint: The primary colors are red, blue, and yellow, and the secondary colors are orange, green, and purple."

        "content": "To create a bouquet with a hue that can be made by mixing a secondary color with a primary color, but not green, orange, or purple, we need to target colors that are tertiary. Tertiary colors are made by mixing a primary color with a secondary color. The tertiary colors are:\n\n1. Red-Orange\n2. Yellow-Orange\n3. Yellow-Green\n4. Blue-Green\n5. Blue-Purple\n6. Red-Purple\n\nSince green, orange, and purple are off-limits, we are left with:\n\n- Red-Orange\n- Blue-Green\n- Red-Purple\n\nLet\u2019s translate this into possible flower colors:\n\n- Red-Orange can be created by mixing red (primary) and orange (secondary).\n- Blue-Green can be created by mixing blue (primary) and green (secondary).\n- Red-Purple can be created by mixing red (primary) and purple (secondary).\n\nNow, we can interpret the positions of the flowers as follows: \n\nSuppose the flowers in the garden are labeled with different colors in a repeating sequence, for example:\n\n1. Red\n2. Blue\n3. Yellow\n4. Orange\n5. Green\n6. Purple\n7. Red\n8. Blue\n9. Yellow\n10. Orange\n11. Green\n12. Purple\n13. Red\n14. Blue\n15. Yellow\n16. Orange\n17. Green\n18. Purple\n19. Red\n\nWe need to pick flowers at odd-numbered positions and cannot pick the same flower twice:\n\n- Position 1: Red\n- Position 3: Yellow\n- Position 5: Green\n- Position 7: Red\n- Position 9: Yellow\n- Position 11: Green\n- Position 13: Red\n- Position 15: Yellow\n- Position 17: Green\n- Position 19: Red\n\nTo create Red-Purple, we need a red and a purple flower, but we cannot pick purple from odd positions.\n\nTo create Blue-Green, we can pick a blue flower and a green flower:\n\n- Position 5: Green\n- Position 19: Red (this is extra as we need Blue-Green)\n\nWe cannot create Red-Orange as we can't pick orange from odd positions. \n\nThus, the best we can do is mix positions 5 (Green) and any blue from even numbered positions such as 2, 8, 14 or 20 if possible to get Blue-Green."
