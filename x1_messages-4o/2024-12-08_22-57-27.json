        "content": "To check the current exchange rate of euros to dollars in the shell, you can use tools like `curl` to fetch data from a financial API service. One popular free API is the ExchangeRate-API. Here\u2019s how you could do it:\n\n1. **Get the current exchange rate**: \n   - First, you need to sign up for an API key from a service that provides exchange rates, such as [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/).\n   - Use `curl` to fetch the data:\n\n     ```bash\n     curl -s \"https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/YOUR_API_KEY/latest/EUR\" | jq '.conversion_rates.USD'\n     ```\n\n   - Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.\n\n2. **Filter the rate for the last 24 hours**:\n   - This typically depends on the API service\u2019s capability to provide historical data. Some services may allow you to specify a date range. Check the API documentation for such capabilities.\n   - If supported, you might use a similar command adjusting the endpoint to fetch historical data for the last 24 hours.\n\n3. **Estimate the cost of a flight from Paris to Berlin**:\n   - The cost of a flight can vary significantly. For estimation, let's assume an average round-trip cost of \u20ac150.\n   - To include taxes and fees, consider an additional 20% (a typical estimate), making the total cost \u20ac180.\n\n   Hence, the estimated round-trip flight cost from Paris to Berlin in euros, including taxes and fees, would be approximately \u20ac180.\n\nNote: For the most accurate and up-to-date exchange rates and flight prices, always refer to a trusted financial or travel service provider."
