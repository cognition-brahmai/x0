I used the following piece of code to get the filename:\n\n```python\nfilename = url.split('/')[-1].split('#')[0].split('?')[0]\n```\n\nThis should strip out all potential queries as well. Is there a more efficient or easy way to get the file name?"

        "content": "To obtain the filename from a URL in a more efficient and reliable way, you can use the `Content-Disposition` header if it's provided by the server. This header can specify the filename directly.\n\nHere's how you can do it with `urllib2` in Python 2:\n\n```python\nimport urllib2\nimport os\n\nurl = 'http://example.com/somefile.zip'\nresponse = urllib2.urlopen(url)\n\n# Extract the filename from the Content-Disposition header\nfilename = None\nif 'Content-Disposition' in response.info():\n    content_disposition = response.info()['Content-Disposition']\n    if 'filename=' in content_disposition:\n        filename = content_disposition.split('filename=')[1].strip('\\\"')\n\n# Fallback to extracting from the URL if no filename was found in headers\nif not filename:\n    filename = os.path.basename(url.split('?')[0])\n\nprint(\"Filename:\", filename)\n```\n\nThis approach first checks the `Content-Disposition` header for a filename. If it's not available, it falls back to extracting the filename from the URL. This method is generally more reliable because it accounts for the filename specified by the server, which might differ from the URL path.\n\nRemember, `urllib2` is available in Python 2. If you're using Python 3, you'd use `urllib.request` instead. Here's how you would do it in Python 3:\n\n```python\nimport urllib.request\nimport os\n\nurl = 'http://example.com/somefile.zip'\nresponse = urllib.request.urlopen(url)\n\n# Extract the filename from the Content-Disposition header\nfilename = None\nif 'Content-Disposition' in response.info():\n    content_disposition = response.info()['Content-Disposition']\n    if 'filename=' in content_disposition:\n        filename = content_disposition.split('filename=')[1].strip('\\\"')\n\n# Fallback to extracting from the URL if no filename was found in headers\nif not filename:\n    filename = os.path.basename(url.split('?')[0])\n\nprint(\"Filename:\", filename)\n```\n\nThis updated code checks for the `Content-Disposition` header and gracefully handles cases where it might not be provided by the server."
