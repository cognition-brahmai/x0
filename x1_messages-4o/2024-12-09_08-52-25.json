        "content": "Certainly! Below is a simple example of an HTML webpage containing a form that allows a user to input their name and email address:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>User Information Form</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Welcome to Our Website</h1>\n    <p>Please fill out the form below:</p>\n\n    <form action=\"/submit\" method=\"post\">\n        <label for=\"name\">Name:</label><br>\n        <input type=\"text\" id=\"name\" name=\"name\" required><br><br>\n\n        <label for=\"email\">Email:</label><br>\n        <input type=\"email\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\" required><br><br>\n\n        <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\">\n    </form>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **DOCTYPE and HTML Structure**: The document starts with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, which defines the document type as HTML5. The `<html>` element wraps the entire content.\n- **Head Section**: This contains metadata and the title of the webpage.\n- **Body Section**: This is where the main content is placed, including the form.\n- **Form Element**: The `<form>` element defines the form, with `action` specifying where to send the form data upon submission and `method` indicating the HTTP method to use.\n- **Labels and Inputs**: The `<label>` elements describe the form fields, and the `<input>` elements are used to accept user input. The `type` attributes specify the type of input expected, such as `text` for the name and `email` for the email address.\n- **Submit Button**: The `<input type=\"submit\">` creates a button to submit the form data.\n\nFeel free to modify the form's action URL or add additional styling and functionality as needed!"
