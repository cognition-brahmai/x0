        "content": "To detect palindrome words within a given sentence using Python, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Split the sentence into individual words.\n2. Check each word to see if it is a palindrome.\n3. A word is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\nHere's a simple Python code to accomplish this:\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(word):\n    # A word is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards\n    return word == word[::-1]\n\ndef find_palindrome_words(sentence):\n    # Split the sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n    \n    # List to hold palindrome words\n    palindrome_words = []\n    \n    # Check each word\n    for word in words:\n        # Normalize the word by removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting to lowercase\n        cleaned_word = ''.join(char.lower() for char in word if char.isalnum())\n        \n        # Check if the cleaned word is a palindrome\n        if is_palindrome(cleaned_word) and cleaned_word:\n            palindrome_words.append(word)\n    \n    return palindrome_words\n\n# Example usage\nsentence = \"A man a plan a canal Panama, Madam in Eden I'm Adam, and Radar are palindromes.\"\npalindromes = find_palindrome_words(sentence)\nprint(\"Palindrome words:\", palindromes)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **is_palindrome function:** This helper function checks if a given word is a palindrome by comparing the word with its reverse (`word[::-1]`).\n- **find_palindrome_words function:** This function splits the sentence into words, normalizes each word by removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting it to lowercase, and checks for palindromes.\n- **Example usage:** The code demonstrates how to use these functions to find palindrome words in a given sentence.\n\nThis code will correctly identify palindrome words, even handling punctuation and case sensitivity."
