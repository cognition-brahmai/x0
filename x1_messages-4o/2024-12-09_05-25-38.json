The class and its constructor are defined as follows:\n\n```python\nclass Person(object):\n'''A class with several methods that revolve around a person's Name and Age.'''\n\n    def __init__(self, name = 'Jane Doe', year = 2012):\n        '''The default constructor for the Person class.'''\n        self.n = name\n        self.y = year\n```\n\nI also have a subclass 'Instructor' that is derived from 'Person', and it overloads the constructor with a new parameter 'degree'. The subclass and its constructor are defined as follows:\n\n```python\nclass Instructor(Person):\n'''A subclass of the Person class, overloads the constructor with a new parameter.'''\n     def __init__(self, name, year, degree):\n         Person.__init__(self, name, year)\n```\n\nHowever, I am having trouble understanding how to get the subclass 'Instructor' to call and use the parent class 'Person' constructor for 'name' and 'year', while also adding the new parameter 'degree' in the subclass. What is the correct way to do this?"

        "content": "To properly extend the `Person` class and add the `degree` parameter in the `Instructor` subclass, you'll need to call the parent class's constructor using `super()`, which is a more modern and recommended approach than directly calling `Person.__init__()`. Additionally, you'll need to initialize the new attribute `degree` within the `Instructor` class. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nclass Person(object):\n    '''A class with several methods that revolve around a person's Name and Age.'''\n\n    def __init__(self, name='Jane Doe', year=2012):\n        '''The default constructor for the Person class.'''\n        self.n = name\n        self.y = year\n\nclass Instructor(Person):\n    '''A subclass of the Person class, overloads the constructor with a new parameter.'''\n\n    def __init__(self, name='Jane Doe', year=2012, degree='Unknown'):\n        super().__init__(name, year)  # Call the constructor of the Person class\n        self.degree = degree  # Initialize the degree attribute\n\n# Example usage:\ninstructor = Instructor(name='John Doe', year=2000, degree='PhD')\nprint(instructor.n)       # Output: John Doe\nprint(instructor.y)       # Output: 2000\nprint(instructor.degree)  # Output: PhD\n```\n\nIn this updated code:\n\n- The `super().__init__(name, year)` call is used to initialize the `name` and `year` attributes using the parent class `Person`'s constructor.\n- The `degree` attribute is then initialized separately in the `Instructor` class.\n- Default values can be provided for the parameters in case no arguments are passed when creating an `Instructor` instance."
