        "content": "Certainly! The discrepancy you're observing in `roc_auc_score` results arises from the difference between using predicted class labels versus predicted probabilities. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **`predict()` Method**:\n   - The `predict()` method provides the predicted class labels for your test data. It essentially gives you a discrete, binary outcome (e.g., 0 or 1).\n   - When you use `roc_auc_score(y_test, y_test_predicted)`, you are computing the AUC based on these hard classifications, which may lead to a less optimal ROC curve and typically a lower AUC score.\n\n2. **`predict_proba()` Method**:\n   - The `predict_proba()` method, on the other hand, provides the predicted probabilities for each class. For binary classification, this returns an array where each row contains the probabilities of the sample belonging to each class.\n   - When you use `roc_auc_score(y_test, p_pred[:, 1])`, you're using the predicted probabilities for the positive class (usually class 1). This approach takes into account the model's confidence in its predictions, which allows for a more nuanced and typically better assessment of performance, leading to a higher AUC score.\n\n### Interpretation of Results:\n\n- **AUC Score with `predict()`**:\n  - This is not generally the preferred method for calculating AUC, as it simplifies the model's output to just class labels, losing valuable information about the model's confidence.\n\n- **AUC Score with `predict_proba()`**:\n  - This is typically the preferred method because it considers the full spectrum of predicted probabilities, allowing the ROC curve to reflect the model's ability to distinguish between the classes across all possible thresholds.\n  - A higher AUC score here suggests that your model is better at ranking predictions in terms of their likelihood of belonging to the positive class.\n\n### Recommendation:\n\nFor a more realistic evaluation of your model's performance, you should use the predicted probabilities (`p_pred[:, 1]`) with `roc_auc_score`. This approach provides a more comprehensive measure of the model's ability to classify the positive class correctly across different threshold settings."
