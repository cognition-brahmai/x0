This flag allows the `^` anchor to match the start of each line within the string, rather than just the start of the entire string. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ntext = \"\"\"    This is a line with leading whitespace.\n    This is another line with leading whitespace.\n    Yet another line with leading whitespace.\"\"\"\n\n# Use re.MULTILINE to affect all lines\npattern = r'^\\s+'\nresult = re.sub(pattern, '', text, flags=re.MULTILINE)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `re.sub()` function is used to replace the leading whitespace (`^\\s+`) at the start of each line with an empty string (`''`). The `re.MULTILINE` flag ensures that the `^` anchor matches the start of each line in the string, so all lines have their leading whitespace removed."
