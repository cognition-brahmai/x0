Despite reading about `STATIC_URL`, `STATIC_ROOT`, the `ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX`, and setting an `Alias /media/ ...` in the Apache configuration, I haven't been able to find a solution that works. My server is running `CentOS`, `Apache 2.2.15`, `Python 2.6.6`, `Django 1.3.1`, and `mod_wsgi 3.2`. I'm also encountering an unusual case where any subdomain on my server serves my Django files. For instance, going to `satoshi.example.com` or `blahblahasdas.satoshi.example.com`, both are serving my Django files. My Apache server throws a `KeyError` every time I restart. Can you help me solve these issues?"

        "content": "Certainly! Let's tackle these issues one by one.\n\n### Issue 1: Django Admin Static Files\n\n1. **Check Django Settings:**\n   - Ensure that your `STATIC_URL` and `STATIC_ROOT` are correctly configured in your `settings.py` file. For example:\n     ```python\n     STATIC_URL = '/static/'\n     STATIC_ROOT = '/path/to/your/static/files/'\n     ```\n   - Make sure you have run `python manage.py collectstatic` to collect all static files into the `STATIC_ROOT`.\n\n2. **Apache Configuration:**\n   - You need to configure Apache to serve the static files. Here's an example configuration you can add to your Apache configuration file:\n     ```apache\n     Alias /static/ /path/to/your/static/files/\n     <Directory /path/to/your/static/files/>\n         Require all granted\n     </Directory>\n     ```\n   - If you have an older version of Apache, replace `Require all granted` with:\n     ```apache\n     Order allow,deny\n     Allow from all\n     ```\n\n3. **Check Permissions:**\n   - Ensure that Apache has permission to read the static files. You might need to adjust the ownership and permissions using `chown` and `chmod`.\n\n### Issue 2: Subdomain Serving\n\n1. **Apache Virtual Hosts:**\n   - It seems like your server may be using a wildcard `ServerAlias`. Check your Apache configuration for any `ServerAlias` directives that might be set to `*` or similar.\n   - Set up a specific `<VirtualHost>` for your main domain and subdomains. For example:\n     ```apache\n     <VirtualHost *:80>\n         ServerName example.com\n         ServerAlias www.example.com\n         DocumentRoot /path/to/your/project\n         ...\n     </VirtualHost>\n\n     <VirtualHost *:80>\n         ServerName satoshi.example.com\n         DocumentRoot /path/to/your/other/project\n         ...\n     </VirtualHost>\n     ```\n\n2. **DNS Configuration:**\n   - Ensure your DNS records match your intended subdomain setup.\n\n### Issue 3: Apache KeyError\n\n1. **Check Apache Logs:**\n   - Look into the Apache error logs (`/var/log/httpd/error_log`) to find more details about the `KeyError`. This might give you a clue about what might be going wrong.\n\n2. **Python Environment:**\n   - Ensure that the Python environment being used by `mod_wsgi` is correctly set up and has all necessary packages installed.\n   - Make sure all environment variables are correctly set for the Django application.\n\n3. **Update Software:**\n   - Consider upgrading Python, Django, and `mod_wsgi` to more recent versions, as those versions are quite old and might have compatibility issues.\n\n4. **Mod_wsgi Configuration:**\n   - Double-check your `mod_wsgi` configuration to ensure it is properly pointing to the correct WSGI application file.\n\nOnce you have made these changes, restart Apache and check if the issues persist. If they do, please provide any error messages or logs, and I can help you further!"
