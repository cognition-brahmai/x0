Below is the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nimport cPickle\n\nclass Foo:\n\n    Bar = namedtuple('Bar', ['x', 'y'])\n\n    def baz(self):\n        s = set()\n        s.add(Foo.Bar(x=2, y=3))\n        print cPickle.dumps(s)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    f = Foo()\n    f.baz()\n```\n\nThe output error I get is:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"scratch.py\", line 15, in <module>\n    f.baz()\n  File \"scratch.py\", line 11, in baz\n    print cPickle.dumps(s)\ncPickle.PicklingError: Can't pickle <class '__main__.Bar'>: attribute lookup __main__.Bar failed\n```\n\nCould the problem be that `Bar` is a member of `Foo`? I've noticed that moving the definition of `Bar` to the top level solves the problem, but I'm not sure why this is happening. Could you please explain this?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering stems from how Python's pickling mechanism works, especially with classes and objects defined within other classes. When you define a class within another class, like your `Bar` namedtuple within the `Foo` class, it becomes a class local to `Foo`. This local scope can cause problems for pickling because the pickle module relies on the ability to import the class globally by its module and name.\n\nWhen you attempt to pickle an object, Python tries to ensure that the object can be reconstructed by importing the class or function by name. Since `Bar` is defined within `Foo`, its fully qualified name is something like `__main__.Foo.Bar`. However, Python cannot import it directly in this way because nested class definitions are not accessible by a simple import statement.\n\nMoving `Bar` to the top level solves the problem because top-level classes and functions can be directly imported using their names, which is what the pickling process relies on.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to make it work:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nimport cPickle\n\nBar = namedtuple('Bar', ['x', 'y'])\n\nclass Foo:\n    def baz(self):\n        s = set()\n        s.add(Bar(x=2, y=3))\n        print(cPickle.dumps(s))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    f = Foo()\n    f.baz()\n```\n\nBy defining `Bar` at the top level, you ensure that it can be pickled without any issues, as it can be easily imported and recognized by the pickling process."
