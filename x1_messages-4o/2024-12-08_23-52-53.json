        "content": "The swiftest land animal living exclusively on the grasslands of Africa is the cheetah. Cheetahs are renowned for their incredible speed, capable of reaching up to 60-70 miles per hour in short bursts covering distances up to 500 meters. They are unique hunters, known for their strategy of sprinting to close the distance to their prey quickly, then using their claws to trip them, and finally suffocating their prey by biting its neck to deliver a precise killing bite.\n\n### Behavioral Patterns of Cheetahs:\n1. **Speed and Agility**: Cheetahs have a lightweight frame, long legs, and a flexible spine, which allow them to achieve high speeds. Their semi-retractable claws provide traction much like cleats on a running shoe, and their long tail helps with balance and steering during high-speed chases.\n\n2. **Stalking and Strategy**: Cheetahs rely on stealth and surprise to get within 20 to 30 meters of their prey before initiating a chase. They use their excellent eyesight to spot prey from a distance in the open savannahs.\n\n3. **Social Structure**: Unlike other big cats, cheetahs are not typically solitary. Males often form small groups called coalitions, usually consisting of brothers, which increases their success rate in hunts and provides protection against larger predators.\n\n4. **Energy Conservation**: Due to the high energy cost of sprinting, cheetahs rest frequently and avoid unnecessary exertion. They hunt during the cooler parts of the day to avoid overheating.\n\nNow, regarding implementing a Swift function to calculate the average speed of a cheetah:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\n// Function to calculate average speed\nfunc calculateAverageSpeed(distance: Double, time: Double) -> Double {\n    // Check if time is greater than zero to avoid division by zero\n    guard time > 0 else {\n        print(\"Time must be greater than zero.\")\n        return 0.0\n    }\n    // Calculate average speed\n    let averageSpeed = distance / time\n    return averageSpeed\n}\n\n// Example usage\nlet distanceTravelled = 300.0 // in meters\nlet timeTaken = 8.0 // in seconds\n\nlet averageSpeed = calculateAverageSpeed(distance: distanceTravelled, time: timeTaken)\nprint(\"The average speed of the cheetah is \\(averageSpeed) meters per second.\")\n```\n\nThis function takes the distance traveled and the time taken as inputs to calculate the average speed, ensuring that time is greater than zero to avoid division errors. Adjust the `distanceTravelled` and `timeTaken` variables as needed for different scenarios."
