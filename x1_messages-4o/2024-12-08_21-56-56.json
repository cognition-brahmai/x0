        "content": "In addition to the given prompt, please add a requirement to the prediction model that it must also take into account the daily humidity levels for the past 6 months. The humidity levels are also formatted in a list, with each item representing the daily percentage of humidity for one day. However, the length of the humidity list is only 150, with missing data points for some days. Your program must handle this missing data appropriately while still accurately predicting the temperature for the next month."

        "content": "To incorporate the daily humidity levels into your prediction model while addressing the missing data, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Data Preprocessing**:\n   - **Align Data**: Ensure that both temperature and humidity data are aligned by date. If any dates are missing from either dataset, you'll need to handle these gaps.\n   - **Handle Missing Data**: For the missing humidity data points, you can use imputation techniques to fill in the gaps. Common methods include:\n     - **Interpolation**: Use linear or spline interpolation to estimate the missing values based on surrounding data points.\n     - **Mean/Median Imputation**: Replace missing values with the mean or median humidity of the available data.\n     - **Forward/Backward Fill**: Use the last known value to fill in subsequent missing values (forward fill) or use the next known value for prior missing values (backward fill).\n\n2. **Feature Engineering**:\n   - **Combine Features**: Create a combined dataset that includes both temperature and humidity as features. This will allow the model to learn from both datasets.\n   - **Additional Features**: Consider adding other derived features, such as moving averages or humidity trends over specific periods, which might enhance the model's predictive power.\n\n3. **Model Selection**:\n   - Choose a suitable prediction model that can handle multivariate time series data. Some options include:\n     - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Especially Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), which are well-suited for sequential data.\n     - **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)** with exogenous variables (ARIMAX), which can incorporate multiple time series.\n     - **Gradient Boosting Models**: Such as XGBoost or LightGBM, which handle missing values well and can be effective for time series forecasting.\n\n4. **Training and Validation**:\n   - Split the data into training and validation sets, ensuring that the split respects the time series order (e.g., train on the first 5 months, validate on the last month).\n   - Train the model on the combined dataset, using both temperature and humidity data.\n   - Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).\n\n5. **Prediction**:\n   - Use the trained model to predict the temperature for the next month, considering the recent humidity trends and patterns as part of the input.\n\nBy incorporating daily humidity levels and handling missing data effectively, your prediction model should be better equipped to provide accurate temperature forecasts."
