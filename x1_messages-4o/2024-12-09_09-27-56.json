        "content": "Certainly! A common regular expression pattern for validating emails in Java is as follows:\n\n```java\nString emailRegex = \"^[\\\\w-\\\\.]+@([\\\\w-]+\\\\.)+[\\\\w-]{2,4}$\";\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the pattern:\n\n- `^` asserts the start of the string.\n- `[\\\\w-\\\\.]+` matches one or more word characters (letters, digits, or underscores), hyphens, or dots. This represents the local part of the email.\n- `@` matches the literal '@' character.\n- `([\\\\w-]+\\\\.)+` matches one or more groups of word characters or hyphens followed by a dot. This represents the domain.\n- `[\\\\w-]{2,4}` matches the top-level domain (TLD), which consists of 2 to 4 word characters or hyphens.\n- `$` asserts the end of the string.\n\nYou can use this pattern with Java's `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes to validate email addresses. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.regex.Pattern;\nimport java.util.regex.Matcher;\n\npublic class EmailValidator {\n    public static boolean isValidEmail(String email) {\n        String emailRegex = \"^[\\\\w-\\\\.]+@([\\\\w-]+\\\\.)+[\\\\w-]{2,4}$\";\n        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(emailRegex);\n        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(email);\n        return matcher.matches();\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String email = \"example@example.com\";\n        System.out.println(\"Is the email valid? \" + isValidEmail(email));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code will check if the provided email address is valid according to the specified pattern. Note that while this regex is suitable for many common cases, email validation can be complex due to the variety of valid email formats as per the official specifications."
