I found the library I want to use on Github, specifically at `https://github.com/praw-dev/praw`, and I want to be able to do a `git pull` in the future to pull the latest commits. Should I use `git clone <git url>` in the project directory and then delete everything except the `praw` directory, so that I can import praw in my python script? However, when I try to import praw in iPython, I get an error `ImportError: No module named praw`. My directory structure is as follows:\n\n```\n~\\myProject\\\n    praw\\\n    myNotebook.ipynb\n```"

        "content": "To use the `praw` library from the GitHub repository and be able to import it in your Python script, you should follow these steps:\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the entire repository to your project directory using:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/praw-dev/praw.git\n   ```\n\n   This will create a `praw` directory inside `myProject`.\n\n2. **Install the Library**: Instead of manually deleting files and trying to import directly from the directory, you should install the library. Navigate into the `praw` directory and install it using `pip`. This way, all dependencies and paths are correctly set up:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd praw\n   pip install -e .\n   ```\n\n   The `-e` flag installs the package in \"editable\" mode, allowing you to pull updates from the repository and have them immediately reflected in your Python environment.\n\n3. **Import the Library**: Now that `praw` is installed, you should be able to import it in your Python scripts or Jupyter notebook without any import errors:\n\n   ```python\n   import praw\n   ```\n\n4. **Updating the Library**: When you want to update to the latest commits, simply navigate to the `praw` directory and run:\n\n   ```bash\n   git pull\n   ```\n\n   Since you installed it in editable mode, any changes will automatically be available in your Python environment.\n\nFollowing these steps ensures that you have a clean installation and can easily update the library while avoiding import issues."
