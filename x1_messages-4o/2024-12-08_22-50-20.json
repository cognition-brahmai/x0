Can you provide me with the formula and the Python code to do this?\n[Formula]\nThe formula to generate all multiples of 5 between 0 and 50 is:\n5n, where n is an integer from 1 to 10.\nTo exclude the numbers 20 and 35 from the list, we can use the following formula:\n5n, where n is an integer from 1 to 10, and n is not equal to 4 or 7.\n[Formula Code]\nIn Python, the code to generate the list of multiples of 5 between 0 and 50, except for 20 and 35, would be:\nmultiples = [5*n for n in range(1,11) if n != 4 and n != 7]\nprint(multiples)\nThis will output:\n[5, 10, 15, 25, 30, 40, 45, 50]"

        "content": "Your explanation and formula are spot on! To generate a list of multiples of 5 between 0 and 50, excluding 20 and 35, you can indeed use the list comprehension approach in Python as you described. Here's the code:\n\n```python\n# Generate multiples of 5 between 0 and 50, except 20 and 35\nmultiples = [5*n for n in range(1, 11) if n != 4 and n != 7]\nprint(multiples)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\n[5, 10, 15, 25, 30, 40, 45, 50]\n```\n\nThis code works by iterating over the range of integers from 1 to 10, calculating the multiple of 5 for each integer, and excluding the cases where the integer is 4 or 7, which correspond to the multiples 20 and 35 respectively."
