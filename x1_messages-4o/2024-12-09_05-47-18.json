I am aware of PEP0435 and that Enum and IntEnum will become official in Python 3.4. I also know about the flufl.enum which was initially going to be the reference implementation but was dropped due to members not being instances of the type and allowing subclasses with additional members simultaneously. Are there any libraries out there that closely resemble what is being added to Python 3.4 and are compatible with Python 2.7?"

        "content": "For implementing enums in Python 2.7 in a way that closely resembles what was introduced in Python 3.4 with the `enum` module, you have a couple of options:\n\n1. **enum34 Backport**: This is a backport of the Python 3.4 `enum` module to Python 2.7. It provides the `Enum`, `IntEnum`, `unique`, and other features from the Python 3.4 `enum` module. You can install it via pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install enum34\n   ```\n\n   Once installed, you can use it similarly to how you would in Python 3.4:\n\n   ```python\n   from enum import Enum\n\n   class Color(Enum):\n       RED = 1\n       GREEN = 2\n       BLUE = 3\n   ```\n\n2. **Flufl.enum**: While you mentioned the limitations of `flufl.enum`, it is still a viable option if you don't require your enum members to be instances of the enum class itself. It offers a different approach to enums, which might be suitable depending on your application's needs. It can be installed via pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install flufl.enum\n   ```\n\n3. **Custom Implementation**: If neither of these libraries meets your needs, you can implement a custom solution. This might involve using a simple class or dictionary to simulate enum-like behavior. Here\u2019s a basic example using a class:\n\n   ```python\n   class Color:\n       RED = 1\n       GREEN = 2\n       BLUE = 3\n\n       @classmethod\n       def names(cls):\n           return {v: k for k, v in cls.__dict__.items() if not k.startswith('_')}\n   ```\n\nUsing the `enum34` backport is usually the most straightforward approach if you're looking for something that closely mimics the future Python 3.4 functionality while maintaining compatibility with Python 2.7."
