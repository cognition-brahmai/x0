Using a traditional balance scale, you can weigh only three sets of spheres. What is the minimum number of weighings required to determine the heaviest sphere, and which set of spheres should be weighed in each weighing to achieve this? Also, provide the reasoning behind your answer."

        "content": "To find the heaviest sphere among 12 identical-looking ones using a balance scale, you can determine the heaviest one in just three weighings. Here's how:\n\n1. **First Weighing:**\n   - Divide the 12 spheres into three groups of 4: Group A, Group B, and Group C.\n   - Weigh Group A against Group B.\n\n   **Outcome Analysis:**\n   - If Group A is heavier, then the heavy sphere is in Group A.\n   - If Group B is heavier, then the heavy sphere is in Group B.\n   - If both groups balance, then the heavy sphere is in Group C.\n\n2. **Second Weighing:**\n   - Take four spheres from the heavier group identified in the first weighing (or Group C if the first weighing was balanced) and divide them into three spheres and one leftover: Group D (3 spheres) and Group E (1 sphere, set aside).\n   - Weigh two spheres from Group D against the other two spheres from the same group.\n\n   **Outcome Analysis:**\n   - If one side is heavier, the heavy sphere is among the three being weighed.\n   - If both sides balance, then the leftover sphere (Group E) is the heavy one.\n\n3. **Third Weighing:**\n   - If the heavy sphere is among the three being weighed in the second weighing, take any two spheres from these three and weigh them against each other.\n\n   **Outcome Analysis:**\n   - If one side is heavier, that sphere is the heavy one.\n   - If both sides balance, the one not being weighed is the heavy sphere.\n\nThis method efficiently narrows down the possibilities by using the outcomes of each weighing to eliminate groups of spheres, ensuring that you identify the heavier sphere in just three weighings."
