I have stored the following JSON in an S3 bucket named 'test':\n\n```python\n{\n  'Details' : \"Something\" \n}\n```\n\nI am using the following code to read this JSON and print the key 'Details':\n\n```python\ns3 = boto3.resource('s3',\n                    aws_access_key_id=<access_key>,\n                    aws_secret_access_key=<secret_key>\n                    )\ncontent_object = s3.Object('test', 'sample_json.txt')\nfile_content = content_object.get()['Body'].read().decode('utf-8')\njson_content = json.loads(repr(file_content))\nprint(json_content['Details'])\n```\n\nHowever, I am receiving the following error: 'string indices must be integers'."

        "content": "The error you're encountering, `'string indices must be integers'`, typically occurs when you're trying to index a string like a dictionary. In this case, the issue likely arises from how you're loading and processing the JSON string.\n\nIn your code, you are using `repr(file_content)` before loading it with `json.loads()`. The `repr()` function returns a string representation of the object, which might not be necessary here and could be causing issues with JSON parsing.\n\nHere's a corrected version of your code without using `repr()`:\n\n```python\nimport boto3\nimport json\n\ns3 = boto3.resource('s3',\n                    aws_access_key_id=<access_key>,\n                    aws_secret_access_key=<secret_key>\n                    )\ncontent_object = s3.Object('test', 'sample_json.txt')\nfile_content = content_object.get()['Body'].read().decode('utf-8')\njson_content = json.loads(file_content)  # Remove repr() here\nprint(json_content['Details'])\n```\n\nMake sure you replace `<access_key>` and `<secret_key>` with your actual AWS credentials or configure them via environment variables or AWS configuration files for better security practices.\n\nThis approach reads the file contents directly from the S3 object and then decodes it from bytes to a string. The `json.loads()` function then correctly parses the string into a JSON object (a Python dictionary), allowing you to access the value associated with the key `'Details'`."
