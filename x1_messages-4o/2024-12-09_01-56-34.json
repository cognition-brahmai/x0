Each method returns a different subset of the model's objects based on a different object property. The code for the custom manager is given below:\n\n```python\nclass FeatureManager(models.Manager):\n\n    def without_test_cases(self):\n        return self.get_query_set().annotate(num_test_cases=models.Count('testcase_set')).filter(num_test_cases=0)\n\n    def standardised(self):\n        return self.get_query_set().annotate(standardised=Count('documentation_set__standard')).filter(standardised__gt=0)\n```\n\nHere, 'testcase_set' and 'documentation_set' refer to 'ManyToManyField's on other models. Is there a way to get a queryset or a list of objects that represents the intersection of the querysets returned by each manager method?"

        "content": "To obtain the intersection of two Django querysets, you can leverage the `intersection()` method that is provided by Django's QuerySet API. This method allows you to find common elements between two querysets that are based on the same model and use the same database.\n\nIn your case, you have a custom manager `FeatureManager` with two methods `without_test_cases()` and `standardised()`, both returning querysets for the same model. You can use the `intersection()` method to get the common objects between the two querysets.\n\nHere is an example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\n# Assuming your model is called Feature and uses FeatureManager as its manager\nclass Feature(models.Model):\n    # Your model fields go here\n\n    objects = FeatureManager()\n\n# Get the querysets from the custom manager methods\nqs_without_test_cases = Feature.objects.without_test_cases()\nqs_standardised = Feature.objects.standardised()\n\n# Find the intersection of the two querysets\nintersection_qs = qs_without_test_cases.intersection(qs_standardised)\n\n# Now you can work with `intersection_qs` as needed\nfor feature in intersection_qs:\n    print(feature)\n```\n\nMake sure both querysets are based on the same model and use the same database to ensure that the `intersection()` method functions correctly. This approach allows you to combine the querysets and get only the objects that are present in both."
