Some of my libraries are also dependent on third party libraries with transitive dependencies. I want a `pip install` on one of my libraries to download/install all of its upstream dependencies. I am not clear about whether requirements files alone can achieve this or if they are just a supplement to using `install_requires`. Should I use `install_requires` in all of my libraries to specify dependencies and version ranges and then only use a requirements file to resolve a conflict and/or freeze them for a production build? If my dependencies are straightforward and guaranteed to never conflict or break backward compatibility, would I still need to use a pip requirements file or just let pip/setuptools/distribute install everything based on `install_requires`?"

        "content": "When managing dependencies for your Python libraries, understanding the distinctions between `install_requires` and requirements files is crucial. Here\u2019s how you can approach this:\n\n1. **`install_requires` in `setup.py`:**\n   - Use `install_requires` to specify the dependencies your library needs to function. This is essential because when someone installs your library via `pip`, it will automatically install the packages listed in `install_requires` along with their dependencies.\n   - Specify version ranges in `install_requires` to ensure compatibility, such as `install_requires=['requests>=2.0,<3.0']`. This helps prevent issues with incompatible versions of dependencies.\n\n2. **Requirements Files (`requirements.txt`):**\n   - These files are typically used to specify an exact set of packages to be installed in a specific environment. They are commonly used in application deployments, not library development.\n   - Use requirements files to \"freeze\" the exact versions of all dependencies and transitive dependencies for a production environment. This ensures reproducibility.\n   - They are useful for resolving conflicts or pinning versions to prevent issues during deployment but are not a substitute for `install_requires`.\n\n3. **Best Practices:**\n   - Always use `install_requires` in your libraries to manage dependencies. This ensures that users installing your library get all the necessary dependencies automatically.\n   - Use a requirements file for your development and production environments to lock the versions of dependencies. This is particularly useful if you have a specific environment setup or need to ensure that all team members are using the same versions.\n   - If your dependencies are straightforward and unlikely to conflict, you might not need a requirements file during development, especially if you\u2019re focusing on library distribution rather than application deployment.\n\nIn summary, use `install_requires` to define dependencies for your library, and leverage requirements files to manage and freeze dependencies in specific environments or for application deployment. This approach balances flexibility during development with stability in production."
