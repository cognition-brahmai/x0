Here is what I have tried:\n\n```python\nlist=['hello','world']\nlist[:0]='foo'\n```\n\nThis gives the output as `['f', 'o', 'o', 'hello', 'world']`. However, I want the output to be `['foo', 'hello', 'world']`. I have searched both the Python documentation and the web, but I have not found a solution. How can I insert a string into a Python list without it being split into individual characters?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing occurs because when you use slicing to insert a string into a list, Python treats the string as an iterable of characters and inserts each character individually. To insert the entire string as a single element, you should use the `insert()` method or slicing with a list containing the string. Here are two ways to achieve what you want:\n\n1. Using the `insert()` method:\n```python\nmy_list = ['hello', 'world']\nmy_list.insert(0, 'foo')\nprint(my_list)  # Output: ['foo', 'hello', 'world']\n```\n\n2. Using slicing with a list:\n```python\nmy_list = ['hello', 'world']\nmy_list[:0] = ['foo']\nprint(my_list)  # Output: ['foo', 'hello', 'world']\n```\n\nBoth methods will insert `'foo'` as a single element at the beginning of the list."
