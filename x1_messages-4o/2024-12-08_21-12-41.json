The code should also avoid the use of any functions that would immediately yield a non-integer result."

Here's a simple R code snippet that uses the numbers 12, 25, and 7 with at least two mathematical operations to produce a non-integer result:\n\n```r\n# Define the numbers\nnum1 <- 12\nnum2 <- 25\nnum3 <- 7\n\n# Perform operations\nresult <- (num1 + num2) / num3\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nIn this code, we first add 12 and 25, resulting in 37. Then, we divide the sum by 7, which yields a non-integer result. The final output will be approximately 5.2857."
