I'm adding some custom layers to an inception resnet, saving the model, then loading and running it. However, I'm encountering an error: `KeyError: \"The name 'output/Softmax:0' refers to a Tensor which does not exist. The operation, 'output/Softmax', does not exist in the graph.\"` I don't understand why this error occurs because `predictions.name` is `'output/Softmax:0'`, but `graph.get_tensor_by_name('output/Softmax:0')` tells me it doesn't exist. I'm aware that I can save and load with TF2's `tf.keras.models.save` and `tf.keras.models.load_model` and then run the model with `model(x)`. However, in my application, I have multiple models in memory and found that the inference takes much longer than in my TF1 code using the `session` object. So, I would prefer to use the TF1 approach with the `session` object in compatibility mode. How can I control the names of input/output when saving the model and what might I be missing?"

        "content": "When migrating from TensorFlow 1 to TensorFlow 2, especially when dealing with saving and loading models in compatibility mode, there are several key points to consider to ensure that the transition is smooth and efficient. Here\u2019s how you can address the issue and control the names of input/output tensors:\n\n1. **Ensure Correct Compatibility Mode Usage**: TensorFlow 2 introduced `tf.compat.v1` to maintain compatibility with TensorFlow 1.x code. Make sure you're using `tf.compat.v1.Session()` and related functions if you're sticking with the session-based approach.\n\n2. **Check for Eager Execution**: TensorFlow 2 uses eager execution by default. If you're using sessions, ensure that eager execution is disabled at the beginning of your script:\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n   tf.compat.v1.disable_eager_execution()\n   ```\n\n3. **Define Explicit Input/Output Tensors**: When building your model and before saving it, explicitly define and name your input and output tensors. This helps avoid ambiguity and ensures consistency when reloading the model.\n\n4. **Save with Specific Signature**: When saving the model, define the input and output signature explicitly using `tf.compat.v1.saved_model.simple_save`. This allows you to specify the exact inputs and outputs:\n   ```python\n   tf.compat.v1.saved_model.simple_save(\n       session,\n       export_dir,\n       inputs={\"input\": input_tensor},\n       outputs={\"output\": output_tensor}\n   )\n   ```\n\n5. **Loading and Inspecting the Graph**: When you load the model, inspect the graph to ensure that all operations and tensors are named as expected. You can use:\n   ```python\n   for op in tf.compat.v1.get_default_graph().get_operations():\n       print(op.name)\n   ```\n\n6. **Debugging Tensor Names**: If you encounter issues with tensor names, double-check that the names are consistent across saving and loading. Consider using the `name` argument when defining layers and operations to enforce consistency.\n\n7. **Performance Considerations**: If performance with `tf.keras` is a concern in TF2, try profiling the model to identify bottlenecks. Sometimes, the performance drop can be due to differences in how models are executed and optimized between TF1 and TF2.\n\n8. **Use `tf.function` for Optimization**: In TF2, wrapping your inference code in a `tf.function` can sometimes improve performance as it allows TensorFlow to apply optimizations similar to graph mode in TF1:\n   ```python\n   @tf.function\n   def run_inference(model, inputs):\n       return model(inputs)\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to manage tensor names effectively and potentially improve the performance of your model inference in TensorFlow 2 while retaining session-based execution."
