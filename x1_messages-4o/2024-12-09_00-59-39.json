I've tried training it to understand that 1, 2, etc. are numbers, but it doesn't seem to recognize this. Am I doing something incorrectly?"

        "content": "When using wit.ai or any similar natural language processing tool, it's important to ensure that the model is properly trained to recognize entities correctly. Here are some steps you can take to improve the recognition of numbers in your wit.ai model:\n\n1. **Training Data**: Ensure that your training data is diverse and adequately represents the scenarios where numbers are used as numbers. Include a variety of examples where numbers are used in different contexts.\n\n2. **Entity Definition**: Make sure you have defined a specific entity for numbers. If wit.ai is confusing numbers with locations or dates, it might be due to overlapping patterns in your examples. Clearly define and differentiate your entities.\n\n3. **Entity Overlap**: Check if there are overlapping entity definitions that might be causing confusion. If you have entities for both locations and numbers, ensure they are distinctly trained with minimal overlap.\n\n4. **Use Built-in Entities**: Wit.ai has built-in entities like `wit/number` and `wit/datetime`. Make sure you're using these built-in entities when appropriate, as they are optimized for recognizing numbers and dates.\n\n5. **Example Utterances**: Provide more example utterances where numbers appear in different contexts, and annotate them correctly. This will help the model learn the context in which numbers appear.\n\n6. **Review Misclassifications**: Regularly review instances where numbers are misclassified and correct them. This feedback loop will help your model improve over time.\n\n7. **Adjust Confidence Thresholds**: Sometimes, adjusting the confidence thresholds for entity recognition might help in reducing misclassifications.\n\n8. **Test in Isolation**: Test the model with sentences that contain only numbers to see how it performs. This can help isolate the issue and determine if the problem is with the specific examples or with the model's understanding of numbers.\n\n9. **Consult Documentation and Support**: Wit.ai's documentation and community support can provide additional insights and specific guidance for your issue.\n\n10. **Iterative Training**: Continuously train the model with new examples and correct errors as they appear. Over time, the model should begin to perform better.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to improve wit.ai's ability to recognize numbers accurately."
