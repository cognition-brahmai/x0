I am able to render all categories from my Category model in my template as shown below:\n\nView:\n```python\ncategories = Category.objects.all()\nt = loader.get_template('index.html')\nv = Context({\n    'categories': categories\n})\nreturn HttpResponse(t.render(v))\n```\n\nTemplate:\n```html\n{% for category in categories %}\n    <h1>{{ category.name }}</h1>\n{% endfor %}\n```\n\nThis works fine. However, now I am trying to print each company in that category. My Company model has a foreign key to the Category model. I've tried using `category.company_set.all()` in the template but it seems like Django doesn't like parentheses in templates. I am currently using Django version 1.0.2 and I'm having difficulty finding relevant information on the Django site due to the different versions."

        "content": "To traverse foreign key related tables in Django templates, especially when working with an older version like Django 1.0.2, you can use Django's template syntax to access related objects without using parentheses. In Django, when you have a `ForeignKey` relationship, Django automatically creates a reverse relationship that you can access using the `_set` suffix.\n\nGiven your `Company` model has a `ForeignKey` to the `Category` model, you can access all companies related to a category using `category.company_set.all` (note the absence of parentheses). Here's how you can modify your template to display each company under its respective category:\n\n### Models:\nEnsure your `Company` model is something like this:\n\n```python\nclass Category(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n\nclass Company(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    category = models.ForeignKey(Category, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n```\n\n### Template:\nAdjust your template to loop through each company's related category:\n\n```html\n{% for category in categories %}\n    <h1>{{ category.name }}</h1>\n    <ul>\n        {% for company in category.company_set.all %}\n            <li>{{ company.name }}</li>\n        {% empty %}\n            <li>No companies in this category.</li>\n        {% endfor %}\n    </ul>\n{% endfor %}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`{% for company in category.company_set.all %}`**: This loops over each `Company` object related to the current `Category` object.\n- **`{% empty %}`**: This tag is used to handle the case where there are no related `Company` objects for a category, providing a default message.\n\n### Note:\n- Ensure that your models are correctly set up with the appropriate relationships.\n- If you're using Django 1.0.2, consider updating to a more recent version for security and improved features, as this version is quite outdated and lacks many enhancements present in later versions.\n\nThis should allow you to display each company under its respective category in your template without needing to call methods directly in the template, respecting Django's template philosophy."
