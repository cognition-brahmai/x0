        "content": "Your Python implementation is a good start for mimicking interfaces as seen in C#. However, Python does not have built-in support for interfaces in the same way C# does. Instead, Python uses abstract base classes (ABCs) to achieve a similar effect. Here's how you can implement your C# code using Python's abstract base classes:\n\n```python\nfrom abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n\nclass IInterface(ABC):\n    @abstractmethod\n    def show(self):\n        pass\n\n\nclass MyClass(IInterface):\n    def show(self):\n        print(\"Hello World!\")\n\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    obj = MyClass()\n    obj.show()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Abstract Base Class (ABC)**: In Python, the `abc` module provides infrastructure for defining abstract base classes. By using `ABC` as a base class and decorating methods with `@abstractmethod`, you prevent the instantiation of the interface directly and ensure that derived classes implement the abstract methods.\n\n2. **Method Decorators**: The `@abstractmethod` decorator is used to declare that a method must be implemented by any non-abstract derived class.\n\n3. **Implementation**: `MyClass` implements the `show` method, satisfying the contract specified by the `IInterface`.\n\n4. **No Direct Interface**: Unlike C#, Python doesn't have an `interface` keyword. Instead, it uses abstract classes to define interfaces.\n\nBy following this pattern, you can effectively simulate interfaces in Python, ensuring that any class implementing `IInterface` will provide its own implementation of the `show` method."
