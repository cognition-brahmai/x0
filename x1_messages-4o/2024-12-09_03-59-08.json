Assume I have two modules in 'path_b' and 'path_a' respectively, with 'path_b' included in the import path. For instance, if I start 'app.py' from 'path_a', I want the output to be \"I was imported from path_a/app.py\". Is this possible?\n\nHere is what my current code looks like:\n\nIn 'path_b/my_module.py':\n```python\nprint \"I was imported from ???\"\n```\n\nIn 'path_a/app.py':\n```python\nimport my_module\n```\n\nTo better understand my question, consider the following scenario:\n\nIn 'path_b/my_module.py':\n```python\ndef foo(file):\n    print \"I was imported from %s\" % file\n```\n\nIn 'path_a/app.py':\n```python\nimport my_module\nmy_module.foo(__file__)\n```\n\nThe output I'm expecting is:\n```shell\n$> python path_app.py\nI was imported from path_a/app.py\n```"

        "content": "To achieve the desired behavior, you can use the `inspect` module in Python, which provides several useful functions to get information about live objects. Specifically, you can use `inspect.getfile()` to retrieve the file from which a module was loaded.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to print the path from where `app.py` is executed:\n\nIn `path_b/my_module.py`:\n```python\nimport inspect\n\ndef foo():\n    # Get the current frame\n    current_frame = inspect.currentframe()\n    # Get the caller frame, which is the frame of the function that called foo()\n    caller_frame = current_frame.f_back\n    # Get the filename of the caller\n    caller_filename = caller_frame.f_globals[\"__file__\"]\n    print(\"I was imported from %s\" % caller_filename)\n```\n\nIn `path_a/app.py`:\n```python\nimport my_module\n\nmy_module.foo()\n```\n\nWhen you run `app.py` from `path_a`, the output will be:\n```shell\n$> python path_a/app.py\nI was imported from path_a/app.py\n```\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. When `my_module.foo()` is called, it inspects the current frame to get information about where the function was called.\n2. `inspect.currentframe()` retrieves the current stack frame.\n3. `current_frame.f_back` retrieves the frame of the caller, which in this case is the frame in which `foo()` was called.\n4. `caller_frame.f_globals[\"__file__\"]` gives you the filename of the script that called `foo()`, which is `app.py` in this case."
