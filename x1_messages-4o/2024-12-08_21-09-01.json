        "content": "Certainly! To create a program in Swift that summarizes an article on the Ebola virus, we can use natural language processing (NLP) techniques. For the machine learning part, we'll assess potential risks based on the article's content.\n\nSwift isn't typically used for NLP or machine learning directly, but you can leverage Python frameworks and integrate them with Swift using PythonKit. Here's a basic outline and code sample to get you started:\n\n1. **Summarization**: We'll use Python's `nltk` library for summarization. You can use Swift to call a Python script for this task.\n\n2. **Risk Assessment**: We'll use a simple machine learning model in Python, such as a logistic regression model, trained on a dataset of articles with labeled risk levels (hypothetical for this example).\n\n### Step 1: Summarization in Python\n\nFirst, create a Python script to handle summarization using `nltk`:\n\n```python\n# summarize.py\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize\n\ndef summarize(text):\n    nltk.download('punkt')\n    nltk.download('stopwords')\n    \n    stop_words = set(stopwords.words(\"english\"))\n    words = word_tokenize(text)\n    \n    freq_table = {}\n    for word in words:\n        word = word.lower()\n        if word not in stop_words:\n            if word in freq_table:\n                freq_table[word] += 1\n            else:\n                freq_table[word] = 1\n    \n    sentences = sent_tokenize(text)\n    sentence_value = {}\n    for sentence in sentences:\n        for word, freq in freq_table.items():\n            if word in sentence.lower():\n                if sentence in sentence_value:\n                    sentence_value[sentence] += freq\n                else:\n                    sentence_value[sentence] = freq\n    \n    average = int(sum(sentence_value.values()) / len(sentence_value))\n    \n    summary = ''\n    for sentence in sentences:\n        if sentence in sentence_value and sentence_value[sentence] > (1.2 * average):\n            summary += \" \" + sentence\n    \n    return summary\n\n# Example usage\narticle = \"Your article text here...\"\nprint(summarize(article))\n```\n\n### Step 2: Risk Assessment in Python\n\nCreate another Python script for risk assessment using a simple logistic regression model:\n\n```python\n# risk_assessment.py\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nimport pickle\n\n# Assume we have a trained model and vectorizer\ndef assess_risk(text):\n    # Load the model and vectorizer\n    with open('vectorizer.pkl', 'rb') as f:\n        vectorizer = pickle.load(f)\n    with open('model.pkl', 'rb') as f:\n        model = pickle.load(f)\n    \n    # Transform the input text\n    text_features = vectorizer.transform([text])\n    \n    # Predict the risk\n    risk_level = model.predict(text_features)\n    return risk_level\n\n# Example usage\narticle = \"Your article text here...\"\nprint(assess_risk(article))\n```\n\n### Step 3: Integrate with Swift using PythonKit\n\nUse PythonKit in Swift to call these Python scripts:\n\n```swift\nimport PythonKit\n\nlet summarize = Python.import(\"summarize\")\nlet riskAssessment = Python.import(\"risk_assessment\")\n\nlet article = \"Your article text here...\"\n\nlet summary = summarize.summarize(article)\nprint(\"Summary: \\(summary)\")\n\nlet riskLevel = riskAssessment.assess_risk(article)\nprint(\"Risk Level: \\(riskLevel)\")\n```\n\n### Summary\n\nThis approach combines Swift with Python for advanced NLP and machine learning tasks. Ensure you have Python and necessary libraries installed, and your model is trained and serialized properly for risk assessment. Adjust paths and data as needed for your specific use case."
