The warning appears when I run the following code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef not_regex(pattern):\n    return r\"((?!{}).)\".format(pattern)\n    \ntmp = pd.DataFrame(['No one has a European accent either @',\n                    'That the kid   reminds me of Kevin'])\n\ntmp[0].str.replace(not_regex('(\\\\b[-/]\\\\b|[a-zA-Z0-9])'), ' ') \n```\n\nAnd the warning message is:\n\n```python\n<ipython-input-8-ef8a43f91dbd>:9: FutureWarning: The default value of regex will change from True to False in a future version.\n  tmp[0].str.replace(not_regex('(\\\\b[-/]\\\\b|[a-zA-Z0-9])'), ' ')\n```"

        "content": "The `FutureWarning` you are encountering is related to the `str.replace()` method in pandas. In the current version, the default value for the `regex` parameter in `str.replace()` is `True`, meaning that it treats the pattern as a regular expression by default. However, in future versions of pandas, the default for this parameter will change to `False`. This change is intended to avoid unexpected behavior for users who are not aware that their pattern is being treated as a regular expression.\n\nIn your code, you're using the `str.replace()` method with a pattern generated by the `not_regex()` function. Since this pattern is intended to be a regular expression, you should explicitly specify `regex=True` to ensure that your code will continue to work as expected in future versions of pandas. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef not_regex(pattern):\n    return r\"((?!{}).)\".format(pattern)\n    \ntmp = pd.DataFrame(['No one has a European accent either @',\n                    'That the kid   reminds me of Kevin'])\n\n# Specify regex=True to indicate that the pattern is a regular expression\ntmp[0] = tmp[0].str.replace(not_regex('(\\\\b[-/]\\\\b|[a-zA-Z0-9])'), ' ', regex=True)\n```\n\nBy setting `regex=True`, you make it explicit that the pattern should be treated as a regular expression, thus avoiding any potential issues when the default changes in the future."
