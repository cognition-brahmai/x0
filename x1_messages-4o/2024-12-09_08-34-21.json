Specifically, I've noticed when using the command `xlwings.Book(<filename>)` the actual workbook opens up, which I believe is the result of using `pywin32`. On the other hand, using `openpyxl.load_workbook(<filename>)` does not open a workbook window, which I believe is because it doesn't use `pywin32`. Could someone explain further how the backends work for each library, and whether there are any benefits or costs to using xlwings and pywin32 for reading workbooks as opposed to openpyxl?"

        "content": "Certainly! Let's delve into the differences between `xlwings` and `openpyxl` when it comes to reading Excel workbooks:\n\n### xlwings\n\n1. **Backend and Architecture**:\n   - `xlwings` uses `pywin32` to interact with Excel, which means it relies on the COM (Component Object Model) interface provided by Microsoft Excel. This allows `xlwings` to control Excel as if you were interacting with it manually.\n   - As a result, when you use `xlwings.Book(<filename>)`, it opens the Excel workbook in the Excel application itself. This is because it essentially automates the Excel application, providing access to all its features.\n\n2. **Advantages**:\n   - Full Excel Functionality: You can use all Excel features, including macros, add-ins, and complex formulas.\n   - Real-Time Updates: You can see changes being made in real time as the Excel window is open.\n   - Excel Environment: Useful for users who want to utilize Excel's interactive environment.\n\n3. **Disadvantages**:\n   - Excel Dependency: Requires Excel to be installed on the system where the script runs.\n   - Performance: Can be slower for batch processing as it involves opening Excel.\n   - Platform Limitation: Primarily works on Windows due to the reliance on COM objects.\n\n### openpyxl\n\n1. **Backend and Architecture**:\n   - `openpyxl` is a pure Python library that interacts directly with Excel files by reading and writing the underlying XML. It does not require Excel to be installed because it does not use the Excel application.\n   - It does not open the Excel application as it works with the file structure directly.\n\n2. **Advantages**:\n   - No Excel Requirement: Can be used on systems without Excel installed, making it platform-independent.\n   - Lightweight: Suitable for reading and writing large numbers of Excel files programmatically without the overhead of launching Excel.\n   - Performance: Generally faster for batch processing as it handles files directly without opening Excel.\n\n3. **Disadvantages**:\n   - Limited Excel Features: Cannot execute VBA macros or access Excel-specific features that are not part of the file structure.\n   - No Real-Time View: Changes are not visible in real-time as no Excel window is opened.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe choice between `xlwings` and `openpyxl` depends largely on your specific needs:\n\n- Use `xlwings` if you need to interact with Excel in a way that involves the full feature set of Excel, especially if you require macros or need a real-time interaction with Excel.\n- Choose `openpyxl` for tasks that are focused on reading and writing Excel files efficiently without needing the Excel application itself, especially if you're working in an environment without Excel installed or on non-Windows platforms.\n\nBoth libraries have their unique strengths and are suited for different use cases depending on the requirements of your project."
