Is there a way to refactor this code without using loops or if/else statements? The same operation needs to be performed for multiple conditions as well. \n\nHere is the code I am starting with: \n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nx = np.random.randint(100, size=(10,5))\n\nfor i in range(x.shape[0]):\n    for j in range(x.shape[1]):\n        if x[i,j] > 50:\n            x[i,j] = 0\n        elif x[i,j] < 50:\n            x[i,j] = 1\n```\n\nAnd for multiple conditions:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(x.shape[0]):\n    for j in range(x.shape[1]):\n        if x[i,j] > 90:\n            x[i,j] = 9\n        elif x[i,j] > 80:\n            x[i,j] = 8\n        elif x[i,j] > 70:\n            x[i,j] = 7\n        elif x[i,j] > 60:\n            x[i,j] = 6\n        elif x[i,j] > 50:\n            x[i,j] = 5\n        elif x[i,j] > 40:\n            x[i,j] = 4\n        else:\n            x[i,j] = 0\n```\n\nI tried the following approach, but it doesn't work as expected because the changes on the array affect the subsequent conditions:\n\n```python\nx[x > 50] = 0\nx[x < 50] = 1\n```"

        "content": "To refactor your code without using explicit loops or if/else statements, you can leverage NumPy's powerful array operations and the `np.where` function, which allows you to apply conditional logic directly on arrays. This approach is more efficient and concise.\n\n### Single Condition Example\n\nFor your first example, where you want to set elements greater than 50 to 0 and less than 50 to 1, you can use `np.where` like this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nx = np.random.randint(100, size=(10, 5))\n\n# Use np.where to apply conditions\nx = np.where(x > 50, 0, 1)\n```\n\n### Multiple Conditions Example\n\nFor your second example with multiple conditions, you can chain `np.where` calls to handle the different conditions:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nx = np.random.randint(100, size=(10, 5))\n\n# Apply multiple conditions with np.where\nx = np.where(x > 90, 9,\n    np.where(x > 80, 8,\n    np.where(x > 70, 7,\n    np.where(x > 60, 6,\n    np.where(x > 50, 5,\n    np.where(x > 40, 4, 0))))))\n```\n\nThis approach nests `np.where` calls to handle each of the conditions, effectively replacing the if-elif-else structure. Each `np.where` takes three arguments: the condition, the value to use if the condition is true, and the value to use if the condition is false (which can be another `np.where` call for further conditions). This allows you to apply complex logic without explicit loops or if/else statements."
