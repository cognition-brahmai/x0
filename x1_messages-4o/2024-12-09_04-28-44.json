I understand that Qt Creator 2.8 and higher support Python but I haven't been able to figure out how to create a Python Qt application with it. The online documentation seems to be scarce. Can someone guide me on how to set up such a project in Qt Creator? Ideally, I'm looking for a simple \"Hello World\" project that I can open in Qt Creator and use that as a starting point to build something."

        "content": "To create a Python Qt application using Qt Creator, you can follow these steps to set up a basic \"Hello World\" project. Although Qt Creator is primarily designed for C++ development, you can integrate Python with the help of PyQt or PySide, which are the Python bindings for Qt.\n\n### Step 1: Install Required Tools\n\n1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n\n2. **Install PyQt or PySide**: You can use either PyQt or PySide as the Python bindings for Qt.\n   - To install PyQt5, use the command: `pip install PyQt5`\n   - To install PySide2, use the command: `pip install PySide2`\n\n3. **Install Qt Creator**: Download and install Qt Creator from the [official Qt website](https://www.qt.io/download).\n\n### Step 2: Set Up a New Project in Qt Creator\n\n1. **Open Qt Creator**: Launch Qt Creator on your system.\n\n2. **Create a New Project**:\n   - Go to `File` -> `New File or Project`.\n   - Select `Non-Qt Project` -> `Plain Python`.\n   - Give your project a name and choose a location to save it. Click `Next`.\n\n3. **Configure Kit**: Choose a kit to configure the project. You can select `Desktop` if it\u2019s available. Click `Next` and then `Finish`.\n\n### Step 3: Create a Simple \"Hello World\" Application\n\n1. **Create a Python File**:\n   - In your new project, right-click on the project folder in the `Projects` pane and select `Add New`.\n   - Choose `Python File` and name it (e.g., `main.py`).\n\n2. **Write the Code**: Open the `main.py` file and add the following code for a simple PyQt5 \"Hello World\" application:\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QLabel, QWidget\n\n   def main():\n       app = QApplication(sys.argv)\n       window = QWidget()\n       window.setWindowTitle('Hello World')\n       label = QLabel('Hello, World!', window)\n       window.setGeometry(100, 100, 280, 80)\n       label.move(60, 30)\n       window.show()\n       sys.exit(app.exec_())\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       main()\n   ```\n\n   Or for a PySide2 application, the code is similar:\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   from PySide2.QtWidgets import QApplication, QLabel, QWidget\n\n   def main():\n       app = QApplication(sys.argv)\n       window = QWidget()\n       window.setWindowTitle('Hello World')\n       label = QLabel('Hello, World!', window)\n       window.setGeometry(100, 100, 280, 80)\n       label.move(60, 30)\n       window.show()\n       sys.exit(app.exec_())\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       main()\n   ```\n\n### Step 4: Run the Application\n\n1. **Run the Script**: To run your Python script, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory, and execute:\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\n   Alternatively, you can configure an external tool in Qt Creator to run Python scripts directly from the IDE.\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- **Integration in Qt Creator**: Qt Creator might not natively support running Python scripts, so using an external terminal or configuring an external tool is often necessary.\n- **UI Design with Qt Designer**: You can use Qt Designer (comes with PyQt or PySide) to create `.ui` files and then convert them to Python code using `pyuic5` for PyQt or `pyside2-uic` for PySide.\n- **Explore Examples**: Look for PyQt or PySide example projects online to further understand how to structure larger applications.\n\nThis setup will give you a basic framework to start developing Python applications using Qt and Qt Creator."
