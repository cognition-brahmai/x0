I'm having some trouble with my current approach and need help. Here's what I have so far:\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\n\ninputFile = raw_input(\"Enter the name of the file:\")\nopenedFile = open(inputFile)\nreadFile = openedFile.read()\n\nmd5Hash = hashlib.md5(readFile)\nmd5Hashed = md5Hash.hexdigest()\n\nsha1Hash = hashlib.sha1(readFile)\nsha1Hashed = sha1Hash.hexdigest()\n\nprint \"File Name: %s\" % inputFile\nprint \"MD5: %r\" % md5Hashed\nprint \"SHA1: %r\" % sha1Hashed\n```"

        "content": "Your current approach is almost correct, but it contains a few issues that need to be addressed:\n\n1. **File Reading:** You should open the file in binary mode to ensure all bytes are read correctly, especially for non-text files.\n2. **Encoding:** The `hashlib` functions require binary data, so ensure that the data passed to them is in the correct format.\n3. **Python 3 Compatibility:** Since you're using `raw_input()`, it seems like you're working with Python 2. If you're considering updating for Python 3, `raw_input()` should be replaced with `input()`.\n\nHere's how you can modify your script:\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\n\n# Get the file name from the user\ninputFile = raw_input(\"Enter the name of the file:\")\n\n# Open the file in binary mode\nwith open(inputFile, 'rb') as openedFile:\n    # Read the entire file\n    readFile = openedFile.read()\n\n# Calculate MD5 hash\nmd5Hash = hashlib.md5(readFile)\nmd5Hashed = md5Hash.hexdigest()\n\n# Calculate SHA1 hash\nsha1Hash = hashlib.sha1(readFile)\nsha1Hashed = sha1Hash.hexdigest()\n\n# Print the results\nprint \"File Name: %s\" % inputFile\nprint \"MD5: %s\" % md5Hashed\nprint \"SHA1: %s\" % sha1Hashed\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n\n- **`open(inputFile, 'rb'):`** This opens the file in binary mode, which is crucial for hashing binary data correctly.\n- **Use of `with` statement:** This ensures the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised.\n- **Print Formatting:** Changed `%r` to `%s` to print the hash values as strings.\n\nThis should resolve the issues you're facing and correctly calculate the MD5 and SHA1 hashes of the file."
