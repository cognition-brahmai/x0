        "content": "In Python, as well as in many other programming environments, complex numbers are denoted with 'j' instead of 'i'. This convention stems from the field of electrical engineering, where 'i' is commonly used to represent current, so 'j' is used to avoid confusion. When Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, implemented complex numbers in the language, he followed this convention to maintain consistency with the practices in electrical engineering and related fields.\n\nAs for programming languages that use 'i' for complex numbers, there aren't many mainstream ones that do. Most programming languages that support complex numbers tend to follow the 'j' convention. However, in mathematical contexts or specialized mathematical software like MATLAB, 'i' is often used to represent the imaginary unit. In such environments, the context makes it clear that 'i' refers to the imaginary unit rather than electrical current, so the potential for confusion is minimized.\n\nUltimately, the choice of 'j' in Python is a matter of convention and consistency with established practices in certain technical fields."
