Below is a Python function that prints all the prime numbers between 0 and a given number \\( N \\):\n\n```python\ndef print_primes_up_to_n(N):\n    if N < 2:\n        print(\"There are no prime numbers less than 2.\")\n        return\n    \n    primes = []\n    for num in range(2, N + 1):\n        is_prime = True\n        for divisor in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):\n            if num % divisor == 0:\n                is_prime = False\n                break\n        if is_prime:\n            primes.append(num)\n    \n    print(f\"Prime numbers between 0 and {N}:\")\n    print(primes)\n\n# Example usage:\nN = 20\nprint_primes_up_to_n(N)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function `print_primes_up_to_n` takes an integer \\( N \\) as input.\n- It checks if \\( N \\) is less than 2, in which case there are no prime numbers to display.\n- It iterates through all numbers from 2 to \\( N \\) and checks if each number is prime.\n- A number is considered prime if it is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.\n- For efficiency, it only checks divisors up to the square root of the number.\n- Prime numbers are collected in a list and printed at the end. \n\nYou can call this function with any value of \\( N \\) to get the prime numbers up to that value."
