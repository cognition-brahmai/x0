The `count()` method in Pandas is typically used to count non-NA/null entries for each column. Here's how you can get the total number of rows:\n\n1. Using `len()` function:\n   ```python\n   cnt = len(df)\n   print(cnt)\n   ```\n\n2. Using the `shape` attribute:\n   ```python\n   cnt = df.shape[0]\n   print(cnt)\n   ```\n\nBoth of these methods will give you the total number of rows in the DataFrame."
