Specifically, I want to be able to run Python 2.7 when I type 'python2' and Python 3.3 when I type 'python3'. I am already familiar with configuring environment variables for one version but how can I do it for multiple versions? I am aiming for a setup similar to a Linux terminal."

        "content": "To achieve a setup on Windows where you can run different versions of Python using commands like `python2` and `python3`, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install Multiple Versions of Python:**\n   - First, ensure that you have installed both Python 2.7 and Python 3.3 on your system. You can download these versions from the official Python website or other trusted sources.\n\n2. **Locate the Installation Directories:**\n   - Find the installation directories for both versions of Python. Typically, they might be located in `C:\\Python27` for Python 2.7 and `C:\\Python33` for Python 3.3, but this can vary depending on your installation choices.\n\n3. **Rename the Executables:**\n   - Navigate to the installation directory of Python 2.7 and rename the `python.exe` file to `python2.exe`.\n   - Similarly, go to the installation directory of Python 3.3 and rename the `python.exe` file to `python3.exe`.\n\n4. **Update System Environment Variables:**\n   - Open the System Properties window by right-clicking on 'This PC' or 'My Computer' on the desktop or in File Explorer, then select 'Properties'. From there, click on 'Advanced system settings', and then click on 'Environment Variables'.\n   \n5. **Modify the PATH Variable:**\n   - In the 'System variables' section, find the `Path` variable and click 'Edit'.\n   - Add the paths to the directories containing the renamed `python2.exe` and `python3.exe` to the PATH environment variable. For example:\n     ```\n     C:\\Python27;\n     C:\\Python33;\n     ```\n   - Ensure these paths are added at the beginning of the list to prioritize them over other Python installations.\n\n6. **Test the Configuration:**\n   - Open a new Command Prompt window to ensure the changes take effect.\n   - Type `python2 --version` to check if it correctly points to Python 2.7.\n   - Type `python3 --version` to check if it correctly points to Python 3.3.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to switch between Python 2.7 and Python 3.3 easily using the `python2` and `python3` commands, similar to a typical Linux setup."
