I had previously installed the release candidates of both programs, which I then uninstalled and replaced with the production releases, including the CUDA toolkit, Parallel Nsight, and the GPU computing SDK. However, when I go to Project->Build Customizations and select CUDA 4.0, I'm unable to set the .cu file as a CUDA C/C++ file. Trying to reload the project results in an error message stating \"The result \"\" of evaluating the value \"$(CudaBuildTasksPath)\" of the \"AssemblyFile\" attribute in element <UsingTask> is not valid.  C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MSBuild\\Microsoft.Cpp\\v4.0\\BuildCustomizations\\CUDA 4.0.targets\". What could be causing this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering seems to be related to the build customization paths that might not have been correctly set during the transition from the release candidate to the production release of CUDA Toolkit 4.0 and Nsight 2.0. This kind of problem often arises from residual or incorrect settings from previous installations. Here are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Uninstall Residual Components**: Make sure that all components from both the release candidates and the production installations have been completely uninstalled. This includes CUDA Toolkit, Nsight, and any associated components.\n\n2. **Clean Up Environment Variables**: Check your system's environment variables to ensure there are no lingering paths related to the old CUDA or Nsight installations. Specifically, look for any entries related to CUDA or Nsight in the `PATH`, `CUDA_PATH`, and `CUDA_PATH_V4_0` environment variables, and remove or update them as necessary.\n\n3. **Reinstall the Production Releases**: After cleaning up, reinstall the production versions of CUDA Toolkit 4.0, Nsight 2.0, and the GPU computing SDK. Ensure that the installation paths are correct and consistent. Sometimes, installing the software in a custom directory can lead to path issues.\n\n4. **Update Visual Studio Project Settings**: After reinstalling, open Visual Studio and revisit the Project -> Build Customizations menu. Ensure that the CUDA 4.0 build customization is enabled. Additionally, verify that the `.cu` files are correctly associated with CUDA C/C++ compilation.\n\n5. **Check MSBuild Customization Files**: Navigate to `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MSBuild\\Microsoft.Cpp\\v4.0\\BuildCustomizations\\` and ensure that the `CUDA 4.0.targets` file exists and is correctly configured. This file should contain valid paths to the CUDA build tasks.\n\n6. **Repair or Update Visual Studio**: If the issue persists, consider repairing your Visual Studio installation or updating it to the latest version. Sometimes, integration issues can arise from outdated Visual Studio components.\n\n7. **Verify CUDA Installation**: Use the `nvcc --version` command in the command prompt to verify that the CUDA toolkit is installed and configured correctly.\n\n8. **Check for Known Issues**: Visit NVIDIA's developer forums or the CUDA toolkit release notes for any known issues or patches that might address your specific problem.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with the build customization path and successfully set your `.cu` files as CUDA C/C++ files in Visual Studio."
