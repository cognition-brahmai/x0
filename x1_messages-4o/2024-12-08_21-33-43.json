        "content": "Can you create a poem using the following six elements: umbrella, rail, water, sky, grass, and leaf? The catch is that each line of the poem must follow a specific pattern based on the element it represents. Line one should use XML tags to describe a way in which the element protects, line two should describe a way in which the element guides, line three should describe a way in which the element nourishes, line four should describe a way in which the element represents possibility, line five should describe a way in which the element provides sensation, and line six should describe a way in which the element displays resilience. The remaining four lines should use any combination of XML tags and descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the emotions and sensations associated with each element. Can you rise to the challenge and create a 10-line poetic masterpiece that both captures the essence of existence and leaves the reader feeling enriched and enlightened?"
