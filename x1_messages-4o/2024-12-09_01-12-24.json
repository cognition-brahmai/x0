I am trying to divide each value in the dictionary by the total value of all dictionary values and update the dictionary to reflect this. So the result I am looking for is `a = {'foo': 0.2, 'bar': 0.3, 'baz': 0.5 }`. Is there a way to achieve this in one line of code?"

Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\na = {'foo': 2, 'bar': 3, 'baz': 5}\ntotal = sum(a.values())\na = {k: v / total for k, v in a.items()}\n```\n\nThis single line of code will update the dictionary `a` so that each value is divided by the total sum of all values in the dictionary."
