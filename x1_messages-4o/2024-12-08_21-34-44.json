        "content": "Biometric authentication technology has seen widespread adoption across various industries beyond just facial recognition. Here are three industries actively using other forms of biometric authentication:\n\n1. **Banking and Finance**: \n   - The banking sector uses fingerprint recognition, voice recognition, and iris scanning to enhance security for transactions, customer identification, and access to banking apps. These methods help in preventing fraud and ensuring secure transactions.\n\n2. **Healthcare**: \n   - In healthcare, biometric technologies like fingerprint scanning and palm vein recognition are used for patient identification, access control to medical records, and ensuring secure access to healthcare facilities. This helps in reducing fraud and improving patient safety.\n\n3. **Airports and Aviation**: \n   - Airports are increasingly using iris and fingerprint scanning for passenger identification and streamlining the boarding process. These biometric systems help in expediting security checks and improving overall airport security and efficiency.\n\nThese industries benefit from the enhanced security, convenience, and speed that biometric authentication technologies provide."
