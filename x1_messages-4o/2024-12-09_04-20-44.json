However, I'm getting a syntax error. I want to log all kinds of exceptions in a file. Could you please advise on the correct way of doing this?\n\n```python\nimport ftplib\nimport urllib2\nimport os\nimport logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger('ftpuploader')\nhdlr = logging.FileHandler('ftplog.log')\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s')\nhdlr.setFormatter(formatter)\nlogger.addHandler(hdlr)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.INFO)\nFTPADDR = \"some ftp address\"\n\ndef upload_to_ftp(con, filepath):\n    try:\n        f = open(filepath,'rb')                # file to send\n        con.storbinary('STOR '+ filepath, f)         # Send the file\n        f.close()                                # Close file and FTP\n        logger.info('File successfully uploaded to '+ FTPADDR)\n    except, e:\n        logger.error('Failed to upload to ftp: '+ str(e))\n```"

        "content": "The syntax error in your code is due to the incorrect use of the `except` clause. In Python, the correct syntax for catching exceptions is `except ExceptionType as e:` rather than using a comma. Additionally, `urllib2` is not used in your code and is not available in Python 3, so you should remove it if you're using Python 3.\n\nHere's the corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport ftplib\nimport os\nimport logging\n\n# Set up logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger('ftpuploader')\nhdlr = logging.FileHandler('ftplog.log')\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s')\nhdlr.setFormatter(formatter)\nlogger.addHandler(hdlr)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.INFO)\n\nFTPADDR = \"some ftp address\"\n\ndef upload_to_ftp(con, filepath):\n    try:\n        with open(filepath, 'rb') as f:  # Using 'with' to ensure file closure\n            con.storbinary('STOR ' + os.path.basename(filepath), f)  # Send the file\n        logger.info('File successfully uploaded to ' + FTPADDR)\n    except ftplib.all_errors as e:  # Catching all FTP-related errors\n        logger.error('Failed to upload to ftp: ' + str(e))\n    except Exception as e:  # Catching any other exceptions\n        logger.error('An unexpected error occurred: ' + str(e))\n\n# Example usage (ensure you have a valid FTP connection and filepath):\n# ftp_con = ftplib.FTP(FTPADDR)\n# ftp_con.login('username', 'password')\n# upload_to_ftp(ftp_con, 'path/to/your/file.txt')\n# ftp_con.quit()\n```\n\n**Key Changes:**\n\n1. **Exception Handling**: Use `except ExceptionType as e:` instead of `except, e:`. In this case, I used `ftplib.all_errors` to catch all exceptions related to FTP operations.\n\n2. **File Handling**: Use a `with` statement for file operations to ensure that the file is properly closed even if an error occurs.\n\n3. **Path Handling**: Use `os.path.basename(filepath)` to ensure the file is uploaded with just its name, not the entire path.\n\n4. **Removed Unused Import**: Removed `import urllib2` as it was not used and is not compatible with Python 3."
