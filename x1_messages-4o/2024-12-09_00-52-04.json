        "content": "To rename the extension of multiple files in a directory from `.html` to `.txt`, you can use a simple loop in a bash shell. Here's a step-by-step method to achieve this:\n\n1. Open your terminal.\n2. Navigate to the directory containing the files you want to rename.\n3. Use the following bash script to rename all `.html` files to `.txt`:\n\n```bash\nfor file in *.html; do\n    mv -- \"$file\" \"${file%.html}.txt\"\ndone\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `for file in *.html; do`: This loop iterates over each file in the current directory that matches the pattern `*.html`.\n- `mv -- \"$file\" \"${file%.html}.txt\"`: This command renames the file. `${file%.html}` removes the `.html` extension from the filename, and `.txt` is appended to it.\n- `done`: This signifies the end of the loop.\n\n### Important Notes:\n- Make sure to execute this script in the directory where your `.html` files are located.\n- It's a good practice to back up your files before running scripts that modify them, just in case something goes wrong.\n- If you want to perform this operation in subdirectories as well, you might need a more complex script using `find` or `shopt -s globstar`."
