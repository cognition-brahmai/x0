First, ensure you have `pymongo` installed. You can install it using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pymongo\n   ```\n\n2. Then, you can use the following code snippet to connect to a MongoDB database:\n\n   ```python\n   from pymongo import MongoClient\n\n   # Replace the following with your MongoDB connection string\n   uri = \"mongodb://username:password@host:port/database_name\"\n\n   # Create a client\n   client = MongoClient(uri)\n\n   # Access the database\n   db = client['database_name']\n\n   # Access a collection\n   collection = db['collection_name']\n\n   # Example operation: Find one document in the collection\n   document = collection.find_one()\n   print(document)\n   ```\n\nReplace `username`, `password`, `host`, `port`, `database_name`, and `collection_name` with your actual MongoDB credentials and details.\n\nMake sure to handle exceptions and errors appropriately in a production environment, such as invalid connections or authentication issues."
