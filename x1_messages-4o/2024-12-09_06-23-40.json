However, I'm not sure if a similar approach would work for sets. Would using `new_set = set(old_set)` result in a set of a set?"

        "content": "In Python, you can clone or copy a set using a similar approach to how you copy dictionaries. When you use `new_set = set(old_set)`, it creates a new set that contains all the elements of `old_set`. It does not result in a set of a set; instead, it simply creates a shallow copy of the original set.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\nold_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nnew_set = set(old_set)\n\nprint(new_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the `copy()` method, which is available for set objects:\n\n```python\nold_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nnew_set = old_set.copy()\n\nprint(new_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n```\n\nBoth methods will give you a shallow copy of the set, which is sufficient for immutable elements like numbers, strings, and tuples. If the set contains mutable elements, changes to those elements will be reflected in both the original and the copied set, as they both reference the same objects."
