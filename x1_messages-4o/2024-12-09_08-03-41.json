However, the normalization doesn't seem to be working as I expected. I thought that the sum of the bins would be 1, but instead, one of the bins is larger than 1. What is this normalization doing exactly? And how can I normalize this histogram such that the integral of the histogram equals 1?\n\n```python\nimport pylab\n\ndata = ([1,1,2,3,3,3,3,3,4,5.1])    \npylab.hist(data, normed=1)\npylab.show()\n```\nHere is the image of the histogram I am getting:\n<img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mwj7z.png\" alt=\"Histogram image\">"

        "content": "The `normed` parameter in the `pylab.hist` function has been deprecated in favor of the `density` parameter. When you set `density=True`, the histogram is normalized such that the area under the histogram is 1, not necessarily that the sum of the bin heights equals 1. \n\nThe density is computed as the number of data points divided by the total number of points times the bin width. This means that the integral (area) of the histogram will be 1, which is suitable for representing a probability density function.\n\nTo achieve the desired normalization where the integral of the histogram equals 1, you should use the `density=True` parameter instead. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport pylab\n\ndata = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5.1]\npylab.hist(data, density=True)  # Use density instead of normed\npylab.show()\n```\n\nThis should give you a histogram where the area under the histogram is equal to 1, aligning with the concept of a probability density function. The bin heights will represent the probability density of the data within each bin."
