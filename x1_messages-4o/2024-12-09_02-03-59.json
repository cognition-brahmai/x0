        "content": "To change the default download path for NLTK packages and avoid the `[Errno 122] Disk quota exceeded` error, you can configure NLTK to use a different directory that has more available space. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Set a Custom NLTK Data Directory:**\n   You can specify a custom directory where NLTK should download its data. You need to set the `NLTK_DATA` environment variable or specify the directory path when downloading data. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n   **Option 1: Set Environment Variable**\n   - On Windows:\n     1. Right-click on `This PC` or `My Computer` and select `Properties`.\n     2. Click on `Advanced system settings`.\n     3. Click on `Environment Variables`.\n     4. Under `User variables` or `System variables`, click `New` and add a variable:\n        - Variable name: `NLTK_DATA`\n        - Variable value: The path to your desired directory (e.g., `C:\\nltk_data`).\n\n   - On macOS/Linux:\n     - Add the following line to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, or `~/.zshrc` file:\n       ```bash\n       export NLTK_DATA=/path/to/your/custom/directory\n       ```\n     - Then, run `source ~/.bashrc`, `source ~/.bash_profile`, or `source ~/.zshrc` to apply the changes.\n\n   **Option 2: Specify Directory in Code**\n   - You can specify the directory directly in your Python code:\n     ```python\n     import nltk\n     nltk.data.path.append('/path/to/your/custom/directory')\n     ```\n\n2. **Download NLTK Data to Custom Directory:**\n   Once you've set up the directory, you can download NLTK data to it:\n   ```python\n   import nltk\n   nltk.download('all', download_dir='/path/to/your/custom/directory')\n   ```\n\n3. **Ensure Permissions and Space:**\n   - Make sure the directory you are using has sufficient disk space and you have write permissions to it.\n\n4. **Verify Installation:**\n   After downloading, you can verify the installation by listing the contents of the directory to check that the necessary NLTK data files are present.\n\n5. **Handling Other Errors:**\n   - If you encounter any other errors, ensure that your Python and NLTK installations are up to date.\n   - Use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to configure NLTK to use a different directory, which should help in avoiding the disk quota exceeded error and ensure that NLTK loads without issues."
