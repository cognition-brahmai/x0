I have provided the features and labels in numpy arrays and set the parameters for my model. Although the model works for other relationships like x and 2x, it is not providing correct results for x and x squared. I have attempted different numbers of units, additional layers, and even used the 'relu' activation function, but the results continue to be incorrect. What could be the source of this problem?\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# TensorFlow only log error messages.\ntf.logging.set_verbosity(tf.logging.ERROR)\n\nfeatures = np.array([-10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,\n                    9, 10], dtype = float)\nlabels = np.array([100, 81, 64, 49, 36, 25, 16, 9, 4, 1, 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64,\n                    81, 100], dtype = float)\n\nmodel = tf.keras.Sequential([\n    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units = 1, input_shape = [1])\n])\n\nmodel.compile(loss = \"mean_squared_error\", optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(0.0001))\nmodel.fit(features, labels, epochs = 50000, verbose = False)\nprint(model.predict([4, 11, 20]))\n```"

        "content": "It looks like you're trying to model a non-linear relationship using a linear model. The relationship between \\( x \\) and \\( x^2 \\) is inherently non-linear, and a single dense layer with one unit will only be able to learn linear relationships. Here are some suggestions that could help you model this non-linear relationship:\n\n1. **Add More Units and Layers**: Increase the number of units in your layer or add more layers to capture non-linear relationships. For instance, using multiple units and layers can help the model learn more complex patterns.\n\n2. **Use Non-linear Activation Functions**: You already mentioned trying 'relu', but it might help to experiment with other activation functions like 'sigmoid' or 'tanh' in hidden layers to introduce non-linearity.\n\n3. **Change the Model Architecture**: Consider adding additional layers to your model. For example:\n   ```python\n   model = tf.keras.Sequential([\n       tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='relu', input_shape=[1]),\n       tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='relu'),\n       tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1)\n   ])\n   ```\n\n4. **Learning Rate**: Adjust the learning rate of the optimizer. Sometimes a smaller or larger learning rate can make a big difference in convergence.\n\n5. **Normalization**: Normalize your input features to have zero mean and unit variance. This can sometimes help the model learn better.\n\n6. **More Epochs**: Although you have already set a large number of epochs, sometimes monitoring the loss over time can help identify if the model is overfitting or underfitting.\n\nHere is an example of how you might modify the code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# TensorFlow only log error messages.\ntf.logging.set_verbosity(tf.logging.ERROR)\n\nfeatures = np.array([-10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,\n                    9, 10], dtype=float)\nlabels = np.array([100, 81, 64, 49, 36, 25, 16, 9, 4, 1, 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64,\n                    81, 100], dtype=float)\n\nmodel = tf.keras.Sequential([\n    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='relu', input_shape=[1]),\n    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation='relu'),\n    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1)\n])\n\nmodel.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(0.001))\nmodel.fit(features, labels, epochs=1000, verbose=False)\nprint(model.predict([4, 11, 20]))\n```\n\nBy introducing additional layers with non-linear activation functions, the model should be better equipped to capture the quadratic relationship between \\( x \\) and \\( x^2 \\)."
