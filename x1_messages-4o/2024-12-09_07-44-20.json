When I try to import a submodule using __import__('module_name.submodule'), it does not work as expected and simply returns 'module_name'. However, when I use __import__('module_name.submodule', fromlist=['arbitrary_value']), it works correctly even though the actual value of 'fromlist' does not seem to matter as long as it is non-empty. Why is this argument required and why does it ignore its values?"

        "content": "The behavior you're encountering with Python's `__import__` function is rooted in how the function is designed to work, particularly with regard to module and submodule imports.\n\nWhen you use the `__import__` function, the intent is to mimic the behavior of the `import` statement in Python. The `__import__` function is primarily used internally by the `import` statement, and it has a specific way of handling imports based on the `fromlist` argument.\n\nHere's what's happening:\n\n1. **Top-Level Module Import**: When you call `__import__('module_name.submodule')`, Python imports the top-level module `module_name` and returns it. This is because `__import__` by default only returns the top-level package unless you specify otherwise using `fromlist`.\n\n2. **Fromlist Argument**: The `fromlist` argument is used to control what is returned by the `__import__` function. If you provide a non-empty `fromlist`, Python will ensure that the specified submodules are loaded and return the module you actually want (in this case, `module_name.submodule`).\n\n3. **Ignoring `fromlist` Values**: The actual values within `fromlist` are not significant in determining what gets imported. What matters is whether `fromlist` is non-empty. When you provide any non-empty list, it signals to Python that it should not just return the top-level module but should also process and return the specified submodules.\n\nIn summary, the `fromlist` argument is necessary to differentiate between simply loading a module and retrieving a specific submodule. It's designed this way to provide flexibility in how modules are imported and to mimic the behavior of `from module_name import submodule` syntax. While the individual values in `fromlist` might not seem important in your use case, they play a role in more complex import scenarios where specific submodules or attributes might be targeted."
