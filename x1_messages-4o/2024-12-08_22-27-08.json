Additionally, I would like to add a filtering feature that allows users to search for specific keywords or political parties using a logical algorithm. For example, if the user enters a mathematical equation such as \"Party = 'BJP' AND TermDuration > 5\", the page should display only the Prime Ministers who belong to the BJP party with a term duration greater than 5 years.\nTo accomplish this task, I have written the following PHP code:\n<?php\n// Define an array of Prime Ministers and their respective details\n$primeMinisters = array(\n    array(\"name\" => \"Jawaharlal Nehru\", \"party\" => \"Indian National Congress\", \"termDuration\" => \"1947-1964\", \"notableAchievements\" => \"First Prime Minister of India, played a key role in the country's independence movement.\"),\n    array(\"name\" => \"Lal Bahadur Shastri\", \"party\" => \"Indian National Congress\", \"termDuration\" => \"1964-1966\", \"notableAchievements\" => \"Played a key role in the country's struggle for independence, introduced the famous slogan 'Jai Jawan Jai Kisan'.\"),\n    array(\"name\" => \"Indira Gandhi\", \"party\" => \"Indian National Congress\", \"termDuration\" => \"1966-1977\", \"notableAchievements\" => \"First female Prime Minister of India, played a key role in India's victory in the Bangladesh Liberation War.\"),\n    array(\"name\" => \"Morarji Desai\", \"party\" => \"Janata Party\", \"termDuration\" => \"1977-1979\", \"notableAchievements\" => \"Played a key role in India's independence movement, served as Chief Minister of Bombay State.\"),\n    array(\"name\" => \"Charan Singh\", \"party\" => \"Janata Party\", \"termDuration\" => \"1979-1980\", \"notableAchievements\" => \"Served as Deputy Prime Minister of India, played a key role in the formation of the Janata Party.\"),\n    array(\"name\" => \"Indira Gandhi\", \"party\" => \"Indian National Congress\", \"termDuration\" => \"1980-1984\", \"notableAchievements\" => \"Played a key role in India's victory in the Sri Lanka and the Operation Blue Star.\"),\n    array(\"name\" => \"Rajiv Gandhi\", \"party\" => \"Indian National Congress\", \"termDuration\" => \"1984-1989\", \"notableAchievements\" => \"Introduced computerization in India, played a key role in ending insurgency in Mizoram.\"),\n    array(\"name\" => \"V.P.

        "content": "Your PHP code is a good start, but there are a few improvements and optimizations you could consider:\n\n1. **Optimize Filtering Logic**: Your current filtering logic splits the equation by spaces and processes each part independently. This can be problematic for more complex expressions. Consider using a parser library or regular expressions to parse and evaluate the logical expressions more reliably.\n\n2. **Date Handling**: The `termDuration` field is a string representing a range. To perform numeric comparisons (like `TermDuration > 5`), you'll need to calculate the duration from the start and end years. This requires converting the term duration strings into a numeric value representing the number of years.\n\n3. **Security and Flexibility**: Allowing users to input raw SQL-like expressions poses a security risk. It might be safer to provide a structured form with dropdowns and inputs for each filterable attribute.\n\n4. **Use of Associative Arrays**: Instead of exploding strings for the filter, use associative arrays to clearly map attribute-value relationships.\n\n5. **Database Storage**: For scalability and performance, consider storing the data in a database and using SQL queries for filtering. This way, you can leverage the database's indexing and query optimization capabilities.\n\nHere's a more structured approach, assuming you convert `termDuration` to a numeric value:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Function to calculate term duration in years\nfunction calculateTermYears($termDuration) {\n    $years = explode(\"-\", $termDuration);\n    if (count($years) == 2) {\n        return intval($years[1]) - intval($years[0]);\n    }\n    return 0; // Handle current ongoing terms if needed\n}\n\n// Define an array of Prime Ministers with calculated term duration\n$primeMinisters = array(\n    array(\"name\" => \"Jawaharlal Nehru\", \"party\" => \"Indian National Congress\", \"termDuration\" => \"1947-1964\", \"notableAchievements\" => \"First Prime Minister of India, played a key role in the country's independence movement.\", \"years\" => calculateTermYears(\"1947-1964\")),\n    // Add other Prime Ministers similarly...\n    array(\"name\" => \"Narendra Modi\", \"party\" => \"Bharatiya Janata Party\", \"termDuration\" => \"2014-Present\", \"notableAchievements\" => \"Launched the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and Make in India initiatives, played a key role in India's COVID-19 vaccination drive.\", \"years\" => calculateTermYears(\"2014-2023\")), // Use current year as end\n);\n\n// Example filter\n$filter = array(\n    'party' => 'BJP',\n    'termDuration' => 5\n);\n\n// Filtering Logic\n$filteredResults = array_filter($primeMinisters, function($pm) use ($filter) {\n    $matches = true;\n    if (isset($filter['party'])) {\n        $matches = $matches && ($pm['party'] === $filter['party']);\n    }\n    if (isset($filter['termDuration'])) {\n        $matches = $matches && ($pm['years'] > $filter['termDuration']);\n    }\n    return $matches;\n});\n\n// Display the filtered results in an HTML table\necho \"<table>\";\necho \"<tr><th>Name</th><th>Party</th><th>Term Duration</th><th>Notable Achievements</th></tr>\";\nforeach ($filteredResults as $filteredResult) {\n    echo \"<tr>\";\n    echo \"<td>\".$filteredResult['name'].\"</td>\";\n    echo \"<td>\".$filteredResult['party'].\"</td>\";\n    echo \"<td>\".$filteredResult['termDuration'].\"</td>\";\n    echo \"<td>\".$filteredResult['notableAchievements'].\"</td>\";\n    echo \"</tr>\";\n}\necho \"</table>\";\n?>\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n- **Calculate Term Duration**: Added a function to calculate the number of years served based on term duration.\n- **Structured Filter**: Changed the filter to a structured array.\n- **Array Filter**: Used `array_filter` to apply the filtering logic, making it more readable and efficient.\n\nRemember, for a real-world application, especially with more data, consider using a database to manage and query this data efficiently."
