        "content": "To disable or silence the log messages from the Requests library in Python, you can adjust the logging level for the `urllib3` library, which is used by Requests to handle HTTP connections. By setting the logging level to `WARNING` or higher, you can suppress the informational messages like connection starts and HTTP responses. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Import the `logging` module**: You'll need this to configure logging levels.\n\n2. **Set the logging level for `urllib3`**: By setting it to `WARNING`, `ERROR`, or `CRITICAL`, you can reduce the verbosity.\n\nHere's a code snippet to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\n# Set the logging level for urllib3\nlogging.getLogger(\"urllib3\").setLevel(logging.WARNING)\n\n# Optionally, you can also disable logging for requests if needed\nlogging.getLogger(\"requests\").setLevel(logging.WARNING)\n\n# Example usage of the requests library\nimport requests\n\nresponse = requests.get(\"http://example.com\")\nprint(response.status_code)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We adjust the logging level for `urllib3` to `WARNING`, which suppresses `INFO` and `DEBUG` messages.\n- Optionally, you can also set the logging level for `requests` itself, though typically it's the `urllib3` messages that are verbose.\n- After setting the logging level, you can proceed to use the Requests library as usual, and the console will no longer display those detailed log messages."
