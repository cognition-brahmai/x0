I can filter the DataFrame for each feature separately using `DF1 = DF[DF['a'] == 0]` and `DF2 = DF[DF['b'] == 0]`. However, when I try to combine these two conditions in a single line of code using the OR operand: `DF3 = DF[DF['a'] == 0 |  DF['b'] == 0]`, I receive a TypeError: `TypeError: cannot compare a dtyped [float64] array with a scalar of type [bool]`. How can I combine these conditions and avoid this error?"

        "content": "When you want to filter a Pandas DataFrame using multiple conditions, you need to ensure that each condition is enclosed in parentheses and that you use the bitwise OR operator `|` instead of the logical OR operator `or`. Additionally, you need to use parentheses around each condition to ensure proper order of operations. This is because the `|` operator has a lower precedence than comparison operators like `==`. \n\nHere's how you can combine the conditions to filter rows where either 'a' or 'b' is equal to 0:\n\n```python\nDF3 = DF[(DF['a'] == 0) | (DF['b'] == 0)]\n```\n\nThis line of code will correctly filter the DataFrame to include rows where either the value in column 'a' or the value in column 'b' is equal to 0. Make sure to always enclose each condition in parentheses when combining them with `|` or `&` for OR and AND operations, respectively."
