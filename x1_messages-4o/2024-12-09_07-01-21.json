        "content": "To group your data by date using the `Date_Time` column in a Pandas DataFrame, you need to ensure that `Date_Time` is of a datetime type and then use the `dt.date` accessor to extract the date part. You can use the `groupby` method to group by the date. Here is how you can do it correctly:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Ensure your Date_Time column is of datetime type\ndf['Date_Time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date_Time'])\n\n# Group by the date part of the Date_Time column\ngrouped_df = df.groupby(df['Date_Time'].dt.date)\n\n# To see the result of the grouping, you can iterate over the groups\nfor date, group in grouped_df:\n    print(f\"Date: {date}\")\n    print(group)\n```\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Convert the `Date_Time` column to a datetime type using `pd.to_datetime()` if it's not already.\n2. Use the `dt.date` accessor to extract the date part from the `Date_Time` column.\n3. Use this date part in the `groupby` method to group the DataFrame by date.\n\nThis approach allows you to group your data by the date directly from the `Date_Time` column without creating a new column."
