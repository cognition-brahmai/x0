        "content": "The error message you're encountering, \"error while loading shared libraries: libpython3.4m.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory,\" suggests that there's an issue with the shared library for Python not being found or not being correctly linked in your virtual environment.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Python Version**: Ensure that your virtual environment is set up with the correct Python version. It seems like you're trying to use Python 3.4, but the system Python is 2.6 based on the `whereis` output. You might need to specify the correct Python binary when setting up the virtual environment.\n\n   ```bash\n   virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.4 /data/virtualenv-test\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Required Libraries**: Make sure that the required Python version and its shared libraries are installed on your system. For Python 3.4, you might need to install it if it's not available:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo yum install python34\n   sudo yum install python34-devel\n   ```\n\n3. **LD_LIBRARY_PATH**: Ensure that the directory containing `libpython3.4m.so.1.0` is in your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. You can set this environment variable in your shell:\n\n   ```bash\n   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n   ```\n\n   Replace `/path/to/lib` with the path where `libpython3.4m.so.1.0` is located.\n\n4. **Rebuild the Virtual Environment**: If the above steps don't work, try removing and recreating your virtual environment. Sometimes starting fresh can resolve configuration issues:\n\n   ```bash\n   rm -rf /data/virtualenv-test\n   virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.4 /data/virtualenv-test\n   source /data/virtualenv-test/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n5. **Check for Broken Links**: Verify there are no broken symbolic links in your virtual environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   find /data/virtualenv-test -type l -exec ls -l {} \\;\n   ```\n\n   Ensure that all links point to valid locations.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the shared library error and get your Python virtual environment up and running. If problems persist, double-check the installation paths and ensure that the Python version and libraries match your virtual environment's requirements."
