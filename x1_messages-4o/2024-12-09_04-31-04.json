I have data like this:\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'date': ['2013-04-01','2013-04-01','2013-04-01','2013-04-02', '2013-04-02'],\n    'user_id': ['0001', '0001', '0002', '0002', '0002'],\n    'duration': [30, 15, 20, 15, 30]})\n```\nAggregating duration is straightforward with this:\n```\ngroup = df.groupby('date')\nagg = group.aggregate({'duration': np.sum})\nagg\n            duration\ndate\n2013-04-01        65\n2013-04-02        45\n```\nBut I want to sum the duration and count distincts at the same time. I tried the following code but it doesn't seem to work:\n```\nagg = group.aggregate({ 'duration': np.sum, 'user_id': count_distinct})\n```\nI also tried this, which works, but I think there should be a better way:\n```\ngroup = df.groupby('date')\nagg = group.aggregate({'duration': np.sum})\nagg['uv'] = df.groupby('date').user_id.nunique()\nagg\n            duration  uv\ndate\n2013-04-01        65   2\n2013-04-02        45   1\n```\nI think I just need to provide a function that returns the count of distinct items of a Series object to the aggregate function, but I am not sure. Is there a more efficient way to do this without duplicating the effort?"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this efficiently by using the `agg` function with a dictionary that specifies the aggregation functions for each column. The `agg` function can apply multiple aggregation functions to different columns simultaneously. For counting unique users, you can use the `nunique` method directly within `agg`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    'date': ['2013-04-01', '2013-04-01', '2013-04-01', '2013-04-02', '2013-04-02'],\n    'user_id': ['0001', '0001', '0002', '0002', '0002'],\n    'duration': [30, 15, 20, 15, 30]\n})\n\n# Group by date and aggregate\nagg = df.groupby('date').agg({\n    'duration': 'sum',\n    'user_id': 'nunique'\n})\n\n# Rename columns for clarity\nagg.rename(columns={'user_id': 'uv'}, inplace=True)\n\n# Display the resulting DataFrame\nprint(agg)\n```\n\nThis will give you the desired output with both the total duration and the number of unique users per day in a single operation:\n\n```\n            duration  uv\ndate                     \n2013-04-01        65   2\n2013-04-02        45   1\n```\n\nBy using `agg` with a dictionary, you specify `'sum'` for the `duration` column and `'nunique'` for the `user_id` column, thus allowing you to perform both operations in one go without additional grouping. This is efficient and concise, making it a better approach for your needs."
