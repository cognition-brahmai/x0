        "content": "Yes, you can definitely streamline your workflow in Vim to save and run Python scripts with a single command. You can achieve this by adding a custom command to your Vim configuration file, typically `~/.vimrc`. Here\u2019s how you can set it up:\n\n1. **Open your Vim configuration file**:\n   You can open your `.vimrc` file using Vim itself:\n   ```bash\n   vim ~/.vimrc\n   ```\n\n2. **Add a custom command**:\n   Add the following lines to your `.vimrc` file:\n\n   ```vim\n   \" Save and run Python script\n   nnoremap <F5> :w<CR>:!python3 %<CR>\n   ```\n\n   Here's what this does:\n   - `nnoremap <F5>`: Maps the F5 key to a sequence of commands in normal mode.\n   - `:w<CR>`: Saves the current file.\n   - `:!python3 %<CR>`: Runs the current file with Python 3. `%` is a placeholder for the current file name.\n\n3. **Reload your `.vimrc` or restart Vim**:\n   After updating your `.vimrc`, either restart Vim or source the file to apply the changes:\n   ```vim\n   :source ~/.vimrc\n   ```\n\n4. **Usage**:\n   - Open your Python script in Vim.\n   - Press `F5` to save and run the script.\n\nThis setup assumes you have Python 3 installed and accessible via the `python3` command. You can adjust the key mapping and command as necessary to fit your specific needs or Python version."
