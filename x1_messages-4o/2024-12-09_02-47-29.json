I tried using a 'return' statement to exit, but I encountered a `SyntaxError: 'return' outside function` error. Here is the code snippet:\n\n```python\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n  try:\n    if condition:\n    #I want to exit here \n    do something\n  finally:\n    do something\n```\nCan anyone provide guidance on how to correctly exit the main function in Python?"

        "content": "In Python, if you encounter a `SyntaxError: 'return' outside function`, it's because the `return` statement is being used outside of a function scope. In your case, since you are trying to exit the main block of your script, you should use `sys.exit()` or `break` if you're within a loop, instead of `return`.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use `sys.exit()`:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    try:\n        if condition:\n            # Exit the script\n            sys.exit()\n        # Do something\n    finally:\n        # Do something in the finally block\n```\n\nMake sure to import the `sys` module at the beginning of your script to use `sys.exit()`. This will terminate the script execution when the condition is met. If you're within a loop and want to exit it, you can use `break` instead."
