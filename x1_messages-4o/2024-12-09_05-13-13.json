For instance, consider testing a CSV-reader. I want the sub-tests to only run if their parent test succeeds, as running these tests is time-consuming and numerous failure reports due to the same reason are not informative. Is there a structured way to achieve this?"

        "content": "To effectively conduct unit testing when there are dependencies between tests, you can employ several strategies to ensure that tests are executed in a structured manner. Here\u2019s a step-by-step approach to handle this situation, particularly in the context of testing a CSV-reader:\n\n1. **Test Organization and Naming Conventions**:\n   - Organize your tests into a hierarchy where basic tests are clearly separated from more complex edge case tests.\n   - Use naming conventions to indicate dependencies, like prefixing or suffixing complex tests with the basic test they depend on.\n\n2. **Use Test Framework Capabilities**:\n   - Many testing frameworks support test dependencies or conditional test execution. For example, in Python\u2019s `unittest`, you can use `@unittest.skipUnless` to conditionally skip tests based on the success of other tests.\n   - In `pytest`, you can use fixtures and marker functions to control test execution flow.\n\n3. **Custom Test Runner or Decorators**:\n   - Implement custom decorators or test runners that check the outcome of parent tests before executing dependent ones.\n   - For instance, you can create a decorator that checks a shared state or log to determine if a parent test passed before running the dependent test.\n\n4. **Shared State or Results Logging**:\n   - Use a shared state or results log file to keep track of test results. Before executing a dependent test, check this state to ensure the parent test succeeded.\n   - This can be a simple dictionary or a more sophisticated logging mechanism depending on your needs.\n\n5. **Test Suites**:\n   - Group tests into suites where complex tests are executed only if the suite of basic tests passes. This can often be controlled via command-line options or configuration files.\n\n6. **Fail Fast Approach**:\n   - Configure your test environment to stop executing tests as soon as a failure is encountered. This is useful when running large test suites where early failures make subsequent tests redundant.\n\n7. **Mocking and Stubbing**:\n   - Use mocking or stubbing to isolate tests from each other. This is particularly useful if you want to simulate the success of a basic test to proceed with more complex tests without actually re-running the basic test.\n\n8. **Parallel Execution with Dependencies**:\n   - Some testing frameworks support parallel execution with dependency handling, ensuring that dependent tests are only run if their prerequisites are met.\n\nBy structuring your tests in this way, you can minimize redundant test execution, reduce noise from failure reports, and ensure a more efficient and informative testing process. Always keep in mind that while dependencies can be managed, it's generally good practice to aim for tests that are as independent as possible to maximize test reliability and maintainability."
