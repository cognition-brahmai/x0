        "content": "I am working with a numpy array and need to create a new array which is the average of every consecutive triplet of elements. This means that the new array will be a third of the size of the original one. For example, if I have a numpy array like `np.array([1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3])`, I would like to get a return array like `np.array([2,2,2])`. Could you suggest an efficient way to achieve this?"

        "content": "Certainly! To achieve the desired result, you can use NumPy's array slicing and reshaping features to compute the average of every consecutive triplet of elements efficiently. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original array\noriginal_array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3])\n\n# Reshape the array into a shape where each row is a triplet\nreshaped_array = original_array.reshape(-1, 3)\n\n# Compute the mean of each triplet along the row axis\naveraged_array = reshaped_array.mean(axis=1)\n\nprint(averaged_array)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- First, you reshape the original array into a shape where each row consists of three elements using `reshape(-1, 3)`. The `-1` tells NumPy to automatically calculate the number of rows based on the length of the array and the specified number of columns (3 in this case).\n- Then, you compute the mean of each row using `mean(axis=1)`, which calculates the mean along the rows (i.e., for each triplet).\n\nThis method is efficient and takes full advantage of NumPy's vectorized operations. The output for the given example will be `np.array([2., 2., 2.])`."
