Solar thermal plants concentrate sunlight to heat a fluid, producing steam that drives turbines.\n\n3. **Environmental Impact**:\n   - **Nuclear**: Low operational greenhouse gas emissions. However, it poses risks of radioactive waste, nuclear accidents, and long-term waste storage challenges.\n   - **Solar**: Virtually no emissions during operation, but requires significant land area and is dependent on sunlight availability. Manufacturing and disposal of solar panels can have environmental impacts.\n\nThis HTML page provides an overview of the two power generation methods, highlighting their key technical aspects and potential environmental impacts. For a more interactive and visual presentation, diagrams and charts can be added as images."
