The error message shows that `Migration admin.0001_initial is applied before its dependency account.0001_initial on database 'default'`. I have a user model that looks like this:\n\n```python\nclass User(AbstractUser):\n    place = models.CharField(max_length=64, null=True, blank=True)\n    address = models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, blank=True)\n```\nHow can I solve this issue?"

        "content": "The `InconsistentMigrationHistory` error you're encountering typically occurs when the migration history of your database is not in sync with the expected migration order defined in your Django application. This can sometimes happen if migrations are applied or rolled back in an unexpected order, or if the migration dependencies are not correctly set up.\n\nHere are steps to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Dependencies in Migrations:**\n   - Open the migration files involved (e.g., `admin/0001_initial.py` and `account/0001_initial.py`) and check for the `dependencies` attribute.\n   - Ensure that the dependencies are correctly defined. If your `User` model is in the `account` app, ensure that `admin/0001_initial` lists `account/0001_initial` as a dependency if it relies on it.\n\n2. **Fake Migrations:**\n   - If you're sure the database schema is correct and you just need to align the migration history, you can fake the migrations.\n   - Run: \n     ```bash\n     python manage.py migrate --fake admin zero\n     python manage.py migrate --fake account zero\n     python manage.py migrate --fake-initial\n     ```\n   - This will reset the migration history for the `admin` and `account` apps and reapply them without actually running the SQL commands.\n\n3. **Reset Migrations:**\n   - If faking migrations doesn't resolve the issue, you might need to reset them completely.\n   - Delete the migration files for the affected apps (ensure you have a backup).\n   - Run:\n     ```bash\n     python manage.py makemigrations\n     python manage.py migrate\n     ```\n   - This will recreate the migration history from scratch.\n\n4. **Inspect the Database:**\n   - Check the `django_migrations` table in your database to see the applied migrations.\n   - Ensure that the entries in this table match the expected migration order.\n\n5. **Use Backup and Restore:**\n   - As a last resort, if the above steps don't resolve the issue, take a backup of your data.\n   - Drop the database, recreate it, and rerun migrations.\n   - Restore your data if necessary.\n\n6. **Collaboration Issue:**\n   - If you're working with a team, ensure everyone is on the same migration history. Conflicts can occur if team members are working on different branches with different migration histories.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the inconsistency in your migration history. Always ensure you have backups before making significant changes, especially when dealing with database migrations."
