However, I want the page to stay in cache until a user comments on a post. My current solution involves keeping a list of all cache keys used for the blog view and then expiring the \"blog\" cache space. Is there a more efficient way to accomplish this?\n  \nCode for my current solution:\n```\n@cache_page( 60 * 15, \"blog\" );\ndef blog( request ) ...\n```"

        "content": "To achieve the functionality of expiring the cache when a user comments on a post in Django, you can use Django's caching framework along with cache invalidation techniques. Instead of manually tracking cache keys, you can use Django's signals to automatically invalidate the cache when a new comment is added.\n\nHere's a more efficient way to implement this:\n\n1. **Use Django Signals**: Connect to the `post_save` signal of the Comment model to clear the cache when a new comment is added.\n\n2. **Cache Invalidation**: Use a specific cache key for each blog post and invalidate that key when a comment is made.\n\nHere's a possible implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom django.core.cache import cache\nfrom django.views.decorators.cache import cache_page\nfrom django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404\nfrom django.db.models.signals import post_save\nfrom django.dispatch import receiver\nfrom .models import BlogPost, Comment\n\n# Cache duration in seconds\nCACHE_TIMEOUT = 60 * 15\n\n@cache_page(CACHE_TIMEOUT, key_prefix='blog')\ndef blog(request, post_id):\n    post = get_object_or_404(BlogPost, id=post_id)\n    # Render your blog post\n    # ...\n\n# Signal handler to clear cache when a comment is added\n@receiver(post_save, sender=Comment)\ndef clear_cache_on_comment(sender, instance, **kwargs):\n    # Assuming the Comment model has a ForeignKey to the BlogPost model\n    post_id = instance.blog_post.id\n    cache_key = f'blog:{post_id}'\n    cache.delete(cache_key)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Cache Key Prefix**: The `@cache_page` decorator uses a `key_prefix` parameter to differentiate cache entries. You can use this feature to generate specific keys for each blog post.\n  \n- **Signal Handling**: The `post_save` signal for the `Comment` model is connected to a signal handler (`clear_cache_on_comment`). This handler is triggered whenever a comment is saved, and it deletes the corresponding cache entry for the related blog post.\n\n- **Cache Key Management**: By forming the cache key using `key_prefix` and the blog post ID, you ensure that each post has a unique cache entry, making it easier to invalidate specific caches without affecting others.\n\nThis approach leverages Django's built-in mechanisms to efficiently manage cache invalidation without needing to manually track cache keys."
