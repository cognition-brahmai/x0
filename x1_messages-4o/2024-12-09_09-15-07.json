        "content": "To create a MySQL database for a bookstore and define three different tables, you can use the following SQL code. This example will create a database named `Bookstore` and three tables: `Books`, `Authors`, and `Customers`.\n\n```sql\n-- Create the database\nCREATE DATABASE Bookstore;\n\n-- Use the database\nUSE Bookstore;\n\n-- Create the Authors table\nCREATE TABLE Authors (\n    AuthorID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    FirstName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n    LastName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n    Bio TEXT\n);\n\n-- Create the Books table\nCREATE TABLE Books (\n    BookID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    Title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n    AuthorID INT,\n    ISBN VARCHAR(13),\n    Price DECIMAL(10, 2),\n    PublishedYear YEAR,\n    Genre VARCHAR(50),\n    FOREIGN KEY (AuthorID) REFERENCES Authors(AuthorID)\n);\n\n-- Create the Customers table\nCREATE TABLE Customers (\n    CustomerID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    FirstName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n    LastName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,\n    Phone VARCHAR(15),\n    Address TEXT\n);\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Database Creation**: The `CREATE DATABASE Bookstore;` statement creates a new database named `Bookstore`.\n\n2. **Authors Table**: \n   - `AuthorID` is the primary key and is auto-incremented.\n   - `FirstName` and `LastName` are required fields for the author's name.\n   - `Bio` allows for a text description of the author.\n\n3. **Books Table**:\n   - `BookID` is the primary key and is auto-incremented.\n   - `Title` is a required field for the book's title.\n   - `AuthorID` is a foreign key linking to the `Authors` table.\n   - `ISBN` stores the book's International Standard Book Number.\n   - `Price` is the cost of the book.\n   - `PublishedYear` is the year the book was published.\n   - `Genre` indicates the category of the book.\n\n4. **Customers Table**:\n   - `CustomerID` is the primary key and is auto-incremented.\n   - `FirstName` and `LastName` are required fields for the customer's name.\n   - `Email` is a unique field to store the customer's email address.\n   - `Phone` stores the customer's phone number.\n   - `Address` stores the customer's physical address.\n\nThis setup provides a basic structure for a bookstore database, allowing you to expand upon it with additional tables or fields as needed."
