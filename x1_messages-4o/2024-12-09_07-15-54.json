Here's how you can split the string `myvar = \"Rajasekar SP\"` using a space as the delimiter:\n\n```python\nmyvar = \"Rajasekar SP\"\nresult = myvar.split(\" \")\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n['Rajasekar', 'SP']\n```\n\nThe `split` method breaks the string at each occurrence of the specified delimiter (in this case, a space) and returns a list of the resulting substrings. If you don't provide any arguments to `split()`, it will split the string by any whitespace by default."
