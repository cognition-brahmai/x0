Here is an example:\n\n```python\ndef multiply_by_two(numbers):\n    # Using a list comprehension to create a new list with each element multiplied by two\n    return [number * 2 for number in numbers]\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = multiply_by_two(numbers)\nprint(result)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n```\n\nIn this example, the `multiply_by_two` function takes a list of numbers as its parameter. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number, multiply it by two, and create a new list with the resulting values. The function then returns this new list."
