        "content": "Prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells are the two primary types of cells that make up organisms, each with distinct features:\n\n1. **Nucleus**:\n   - **Prokaryotic Cells**: Lack a true nucleus. The genetic material is located in a region called the nucleoid, which is not membrane-bound.\n   - **Eukaryotic Cells**: Have a well-defined, membrane-bound nucleus that contains the cell\u2019s genetic material.\n\n2. **Size**:\n   - **Prokaryotic Cells**: Generally smaller, typically ranging from 0.1 to 5 micrometers in diameter.\n   - **Eukaryotic Cells**: Larger, usually between 10 to 100 micrometers in diameter.\n\n3. **Complexity**:\n   - **Prokaryotic Cells**: Simpler structure, lacking membrane-bound organelles.\n   - **Eukaryotic Cells**: More complex, with numerous membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and, in plant cells, chloroplasts.\n\n4. **Cell Wall**:\n   - **Prokaryotic Cells**: Most have a rigid cell wall composed of peptidoglycan (in bacteria) or other substances (in archaea).\n   - **Eukaryotic Cells**: In plants and fungi, there is a cell wall made of cellulose and chitin, respectively. Animal cells lack a cell wall.\n\n5. **Reproduction**:\n   - **Prokaryotic Cells**: Reproduce asexually through binary fission, a simple cell division process.\n   - **Eukaryotic Cells**: Reproduce through mitosis (for somatic cells) and meiosis (for gametes).\n\n6. **Genetic Material**:\n   - **Prokaryotic Cells**: Usually have a single, circular DNA molecule and may contain plasmids.\n   - **Eukaryotic Cells**: Have multiple linear chromosomes stored within the nucleus.\n\n7. **Ribosomes**:\n   - **Prokaryotic Cells**: Have smaller ribosomes (70S).\n   - **Eukaryotic Cells**: Contain larger ribosomes (80S).\n\n8. **Flagella**:\n   - **Prokaryotic Cells**: Simple structure, composed of a single type of protein.\n   - **Eukaryotic Cells**: Complex structure, composed of multiple proteins with a 9+2 arrangement of microtubules.\n\n9. **Examples**:\n   - **Prokaryotic Cells**: Bacteria and Archaea.\n   - **Eukaryotic Cells**: Animals, plants, fungi, and protists.\n\nThese differences reflect the evolutionary divergence between prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms and contribute to their unique biological roles and capabilities."
