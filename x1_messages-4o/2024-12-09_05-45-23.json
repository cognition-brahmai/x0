I have a container that loads a Pytorch model and when I try to start it, I get an error stating \"Found no NVIDIA driver on your system\". I'm sure that nvidia-docker2 is working as I can see the output of NVIDIA-SMI. I've attempted setting \"default-runtime\": nvidia in /etc/docker/daemon.json, using docker run --runtime=nvidia <IMAGE_ID>, and adding certain variables to my Dockerfile, but I'm still encountering the error. How can I resolve this?"

        "content": "To resolve the issue where Docker does not recognize NVIDIA drivers, even though `nvidia-docker2` is installed and `nvidia-smi` works, follow these steps to ensure proper setup and configuration:\n\n1. **Verify NVIDIA Container Toolkit Installation**:\n   Ensure that the NVIDIA Container Toolkit is correctly installed and that Docker is using the NVIDIA runtime. Here's how to check:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-docker2\n   sudo systemctl restart docker\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Daemon Configuration**:\n   Make sure your Docker daemon is configured to use the NVIDIA runtime by default. Open `/etc/docker/daemon.json` and verify that it includes:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"runtimes\": {\n       \"nvidia\": {\n         \"path\": \"nvidia-container-runtime\",\n         \"runtimeArgs\": []\n       }\n     },\n     \"default-runtime\": \"nvidia\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n   After editing, restart Docker:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo systemctl restart docker\n   ```\n\n3. **Use NVIDIA Runtime in Docker Run Command**:\n   Ensure you're using the `--gpus` flag with Docker, which is the preferred way as of more recent Docker versions:\n\n   ```bash\n   docker run --gpus all <IMAGE_ID>\n   ```\n\n   This flag enables Docker to use the NVIDIA runtime.\n\n4. **Verify CUDA and Driver Versions**:\n   Make sure your host machine has compatible versions of the NVIDIA drivers and CUDA toolkit. The container should be compatible with these versions. You can check the driver version using:\n\n   ```bash\n   nvidia-smi\n   ```\n\n   Inside the container, verify CUDA installation:\n\n   ```bash\n   nvcc --version\n   ```\n\n5. **Dockerfile Adjustments**:\n   Ensure your Dockerfile includes the necessary environment variables and libraries to access the GPU. For example:\n\n   ```dockerfile\n   FROM nvidia/cuda:11.0-base\n\n   # Install necessary packages\n   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \\\n       python3-pip \\\n       && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\n   # Set environment variables for CUDA and cuDNN\n   ENV CUDA_VERSION=11.0\n   ENV CUDNN_VERSION=8\n\n   # Additional setup if needed\n   ```\n\n6. **Test with NVIDIA Samples**:\n   Test your setup with a simple CUDA sample to ensure the GPU is accessible:\n\n   ```bash\n   docker run --gpus all nvidia/cuda:11.0-base nvidia-smi\n   ```\n\n   If this works, the issue may be specific to your application or container configuration.\n\n7. **Debugging**:\n   If the problem persists, check the logs for more detailed error messages and consider updating Docker, the NVIDIA drivers, and the NVIDIA Container Toolkit to the latest versions.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to configure Docker to recognize and utilize NVIDIA drivers correctly."
