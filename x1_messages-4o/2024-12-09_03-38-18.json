        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"EOFError: EOF when reading a line,\" typically occurs when the `input()` function is expecting user input, but it doesn't receive any, often because the program is executed in an environment where interactive input isn't supported or available.\n\nAdditionally, there are a couple of issues in your code that need fixing:\n\n1. **Input Conversion:** The inputs `width` and `height` are being read as strings. You need to convert them to integers or floats to perform arithmetic operations.\n\n2. **Environment Constraints:** If you're running this script in an environment that doesn't support interactive input (like some online coding platforms), you'll need to provide the input differently.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to handle these issues:\n\n```python\ndef rectanglePerimeter(width, height):\n    return (width + height) * 2\n\n# Instead of using input(), directly assign values for testing\n# width = int(input(\"Enter the width: \"))\n# height = int(input(\"Enter the height: \"))\n\n# Example: Testing with predefined values\nwidth = 5  # or any integer value\nheight = 10  # or any integer value\n\nprint(rectanglePerimeter(width, height))\n```\n\n### Steps to Fix:\n\n1. **Convert Input to Numbers:**\n   - Use `int()` or `float()` to convert the inputs to numbers.\n   \n2. **Testing Without Interactive Input:**\n   - Assign values directly to `width` and `height` for testing purposes if you can't use interactive input.\n\n3. **Run in an Interactive Environment:**\n   - If you need to use `input()`, make sure you're running the script in a terminal or an IDE that supports interactive input.\n\nThis should resolve your `EOFError` and allow you to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle correctly."
