For example, in C we can do something like this:\n```c\nwhile( (i=a) != b ) { }\n```\nBut when I try to do the same in Python:\n```python\nwhile (i = sys.stdin.read(1)) != \"\\n\":\n```\nI am getting a syntax error:\n```python\nwhile (i = sys.stdin.read(1)) != \"\\n\":\n     ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n```\nIt appears the error is pointing at the '=' sign. Is there a workaround in Python to assign a value in the loop condition?"

        "content": "In Python, assignment within expressions like you can do in C is not allowed. However, starting from Python 3.8, you can use the \"walrus operator\" (`:=`), which allows assignment expressions. This operator enables you to assign a value to a variable as part of an expression. So, you can achieve similar functionality in your `while` loop condition. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nwhile (i := sys.stdin.read(1)) != \"\\n\":\n    # Your code here\n    print(f\"Read character: {i}\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `:=` operator assigns the result of `sys.stdin.read(1)` to `i` and then evaluates the expression, allowing you to use the assigned value within the condition of the `while` loop. This should resolve the syntax error you're encountering and provide the functionality you're looking for."
