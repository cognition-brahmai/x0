        "content": "Creating a C# program to simulate a vending machine is a great way to practice your programming skills. Below is a simple example to get you started. This program will cover basic functionality such as displaying items, taking input from the user, processing payments, and dispensing items.\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\n\nclass VendingMachine\n{\n    public static void Main()\n    {\n        Dictionary<string, (string Name, double Price)> items = new Dictionary<string, (string, double)>\n        {\n            {\"A1\", (\"Soda\", 1.25)},\n            {\"A2\", (\"Chips\", 1.00)},\n            {\"A3\", (\"Candy\", 0.75)}\n        };\n\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Welcome to the Vending Machine!\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Available items:\");\n\n        foreach (var item in items)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine($\"{item.Key}: {item.Value.Name} - ${item.Value.Price}\");\n        }\n\n        Console.Write(\"Please select an item code: \");\n        string selection = Console.ReadLine();\n\n        if (items.ContainsKey(selection))\n        {\n            var selectedItem = items[selection];\n            Console.WriteLine($\"You selected {selectedItem.Name}, which costs ${selectedItem.Price}\");\n            \n            Console.Write(\"Please insert money: $\");\n            double moneyInserted = Convert.ToDouble(Console.ReadLine());\n\n            if (moneyInserted >= selectedItem.Price)\n            {\n                double change = moneyInserted - selectedItem.Price;\n                Console.WriteLine($\"Dispensing {selectedItem.Name}. Your change is ${change:F2}\");\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(\"Insufficient funds. Please insert more money.\");\n            }\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Invalid selection. Please try again.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Dictionary to Store Items**: \n   - A dictionary is used to store item codes, names, and prices. This allows easy lookup of items based on the code entered by the user.\n\n2. **Displaying Items**: \n   - The program iterates over the dictionary and displays the available items along with their prices.\n\n3. **User Input**: \n   - The user is prompted to enter an item code. The input is checked against the keys in the dictionary to ensure a valid selection.\n\n4. **Processing Payment**: \n   - If the selection is valid, the program asks the user to insert money. It checks whether the money inserted is sufficient to cover the cost of the selected item.\n\n5. **Dispensing Item and Change**:\n   - If enough money is inserted, the item is \"dispensed\" and any change is calculated and displayed. Otherwise, the user is informed that they need to insert more money.\n\nThis basic program can be expanded with more features such as handling different types of coins and notes, restocking items, or keeping track of sales."
