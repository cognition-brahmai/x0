        "content": "Optimizing JavaScript code for performance involves several best practices, such as minimizing memory usage, reducing the complexity of algorithms, and leveraging efficient coding patterns. In the case of the Fibonacci sequence, the recursive method you've provided has exponential time complexity, which is inefficient for larger values of `n`. We can optimize this using a technique called memoization, which stores previously computed results to avoid redundant calculations.\n\nHere's how you can refactor the Fibonacci function using memoization:\n\n```javascript\nfunction fibonacci(n, memo = {}) {\n  if (n < 2) {\n    return n;\n  }\n  if (memo[n]) {\n    return memo[n];\n  }\n  memo[n] = fibonacci(n - 1, memo) + fibonacci(n - 2, memo);\n  return memo[n];\n}\n\nconsole.log(fibonacci(10)); // Output: 55\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Memoization**: We introduce a `memo` object to store the results of Fibonacci calculations. This way, if a Fibonacci calculation has already been computed, it can be retrieved from the `memo` object, significantly reducing the number of recursive calls.\n- **Base Case**: The base case remains the same, returning the number itself if `n` is less than 2.\n- **Recursive Case**: Before making the recursive call, we check if the result for `n` is already stored in `memo`. If so, we return it directly. If not, we compute it, store it in `memo`, and then return it.\n\n### Benefits:\n\n- **Time Complexity**: The optimized version reduces the time complexity from exponential \\(O(2^n)\\) to linear \\(O(n)\\), making it significantly faster for larger values of `n`.\n- **Space Complexity**: The trade-off is a slight increase in space complexity due to the storage of results in the `memo` object, but this is generally acceptable for the performance gains achieved.\n\nThis approach provides a substantial performance improvement, especially for larger values of `n`, by avoiding redundant calculations."
