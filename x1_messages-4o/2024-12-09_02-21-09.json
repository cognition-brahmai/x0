For instance, I want to convert the numbers 1, 10, 100 to \"001\", \"010\", \"100\" respectively. I'm aware that this can be achieved using `zfill` and `%`-based formatting (like `'%03d' % 5`), but I want to use `str.format` to keep my code consistent and also to enhance my understanding of the Format Specification Mini-Language."

        "content": "To achieve leading zeroes in an integer using the `str.format` method in Python, you can use the format specification within the curly braces. The format specification allows you to define how you want the value to be presented, including width and zero-padding. \n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\nnumbers = [1, 10, 100]\n\n# Use str.format to display with leading zeroes\nformatted_numbers = [\"{:03}\".format(num) for num in numbers]\n\n# Print the formatted numbers\nfor num in formatted_numbers:\n    print(num)\n```\n\nIn this example, `\"{:03}\"` is the format specification:\n\n- `:` indicates the start of the format specification.\n- `0` is the fill character, which specifies that zeroes should be used for padding.\n- `3` is the width, which indicates the total number of characters the output should have. If the number has fewer digits, it will be padded with leading zeroes.\n\nSo, for the numbers 1, 10, and 100, the output will be \"001\", \"010\", and \"100\", respectively. This method is part of the Format Specification Mini-Language in Python and provides a flexible way to format strings."
