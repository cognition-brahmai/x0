        "content": "In the provided code, the class `MyRequestHandler` is being passed as an argument to the `TCP` (which is actually `TCPServer`) constructor. This might seem a bit unusual at first, but it's actually a common pattern in Python, especially in network programming and frameworks that involve handling requests.\n\nHere's why and how it works:\n\n1. **Class as First-Class Object**: In Python, classes are first-class objects. This means that classes can be passed around and used as arguments, just like any other object (such as integers, strings, or functions). When you pass `MyRequestHandler` as an argument, you are passing the class itself, not an instance of it.\n\n2. **Request Handler**: The `TCPServer` class expects a request handler class as its second argument. It uses this handler class to create an instance whenever a new connection is made. Essentially, `TCPServer` is saying, \"Whenever a new connection comes in, I'll create an instance of this handler class to process the connection.\"\n\n3. **Dynamic Instantiation**: When a client connects to the server, the server creates an instance of `MyRequestHandler` to handle the request. The `handle` method of this instance is called to process the incoming data and respond to the client. By passing the class itself, the server can dynamically instantiate it as needed, without knowing anything about the internals of the class in advance.\n\n4. **Using `StreamRequestHandler`**: `MyRequestHandler` inherits from `StreamRequestHandler`, which provides a framework for handling each client connection in a separate thread. It provides convenient attributes like `self.rfile` and `self.wfile` for reading from and writing to the socket.\n\nOverall, this pattern allows for a flexible design where different kinds of request handlers can be used with the same server code, simply by passing different classes to the server. This makes it easy to extend and customize server behavior."
