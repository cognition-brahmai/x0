I know that I can use `a.append(some_value)` to add an element at the end of the list, and `a.insert(exact_position, some_value)` to insert an element at any other position in the list. However, when I try to add an element at the end with `a.insert(-1, 5)`, it inserts the element before the last element, resulting in `[1,2,3,5,4]`. What is the correct way to use list.insert() to add an element at the end of the list?"

        "content": "To add an element at the end of a list using the `list.insert()` method, you need to specify the index position that is equal to the current length of the list. Since list indices in Python are zero-based, the position just after the last element is equal to the length of the list.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\na = [1, 2, 3, 4]\na.insert(len(a), 5)\nprint(a)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\nBy using `len(a)` as the index, you effectively insert the element at the very end of the list, achieving the same result as `a.append(5)`."
