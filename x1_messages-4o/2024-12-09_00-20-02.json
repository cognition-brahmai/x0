I am trying to have multiple instances of PyPlot windows open at the same time, but it seems like the second window only opens once the first has been closed, or it causes my program to freeze. Is there a way to work around this, or is PyPlot limited to one window?"

        "content": "Yes, you can open multiple windows using PyPlot in Python by creating multiple figures. Each figure can be displayed in its own window. The key is to use `matplotlib.pyplot.figure()` to create a new figure for each window you want to open. Here's a basic example of how you can do this:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# First window\nx = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)\ny1 = np.sin(x)\n\nplt.figure()  # Create a new figure\nplt.plot(x, y1)\nplt.title('Sine Wave')\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('sin(x)')\nplt.show(block=False)  # Display the figure without blocking\n\n# Second window\ny2 = np.cos(x)\n\nplt.figure()  # Create another new figure\nplt.plot(x, y2)\nplt.title('Cosine Wave')\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('cos(x)')\nplt.show(block=False)  # Display the figure without blocking\n\n# Optionally, keep the script running to keep the windows open\ninput(\"Press Enter to exit...\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `plt.figure()` is used to create a new figure object. Each call to this function creates a separate window.\n- `plt.show(block=False)` is used to display the plot in a non-blocking way. This allows the script to continue running and open multiple windows simultaneously. If you omit `block=False`, the script will pause at each `plt.show()` until the corresponding window is closed.\n- You can use `input(\"Press Enter to exit...\")` or a similar method to keep the script running if needed, so the windows remain open.\n\nRemember, the method to keep the script running might differ depending on your environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook might handle it differently)."
