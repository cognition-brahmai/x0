The error messages suggest that the directory `/Users/janghyunsoo/Library/Caches/pip/http` or its parent directory is not owned by the current user and the cache has been disabled. I was advised to check the permissions and owner of that directory, and if I'm executing pip with sudo, to use sudo's -H flag. I also received an error while trying to build the '_mssql' extension. How can I resolve these issues and successfully install pymssql?"

        "content": "To resolve the issues you're facing while trying to install the `pymssql` module on your Mac with OS X 10.11.5, you'll need to address both the permission issues and the build dependencies for `pymssql`. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you:\n\n1. **Check and Fix Permissions**:\n    - You can change the ownership of the `pip` cache directory to your current user. Run the following command in Terminal to change ownership:\n      ```bash\n      sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/Library/Caches/pip\n      ```\n\n2. **Ensure Xcode Command Line Tools are Installed**:\n    - You need the Xcode command line tools to build certain Python packages. Install or update them using:\n      ```bash\n      xcode-select --install\n      ```\n\n3. **Install Homebrew** (if not already installed):\n    - Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that makes it easy to install software. If you don't have it, you can install it with:\n      ```bash\n      /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n      ```\n\n4. **Install Required Dependencies**:\n    - `pymssql` requires `freetds` to be installed. You can install it using Homebrew:\n      ```bash\n      brew install freetds\n      ```\n    - Ensure you have the necessary development tools and libraries, particularly `openssl`:\n      ```bash\n      brew install openssl\n      ```\n\n5. **Set Environment Variables**:\n    - Inform the compiler where to find `freetds` and `openssl` by setting environment variables:\n      ```bash\n      export LDFLAGS=\"-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib\"\n      export CPPFLAGS=\"-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include\"\n      export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/pkgconfig\"\n      ```\n\n6. **Install pymssql using pip**:\n    - Now, try installing `pymssql` again:\n      ```bash\n      pip install pymssql\n      ```\n\n7. **Use Virtual Environments** (optional but recommended):\n    - It's often a good idea to use Python virtual environments to avoid dependency conflicts. You can create a virtual environment and install `pymssql` within it:\n      ```bash\n      python3 -m venv myenv\n      source myenv/bin/activate\n      pip install pymssql\n      ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the permission issues and successfully build and install the `pymssql` module on your Mac. If you encounter further errors during the installation, please share the specific error messages for additional guidance."
