        "content": "Why does comparing matching strings in Python seem to be faster than comparing non-matching strings of the same length? I've observed this phenomenon during two measurements using the timeit module as seen in the code snippet below:\n\n```python\ntimeit.timeit('\"toto\"==\"1234\"', number=100000000)\n1.8320042459999968\ntimeit.timeit('\"toto\"==\"toto\"', number=100000000)\n1.4517491540000265\n```\n\nFrom my understanding, Python should compare strings character by character. Thus, comparing \"toto\" to \"toto\" should take longer than comparing \"toto\" to \"1234\" because it would require four tests as opposed to just one. Could this be because the comparison is hash-based? If so, why aren't the timings the same for both comparisons?"

        "content": "The observation you've made is indeed interesting, and it can be attributed to the way string comparison works in Python, along with some optimizations that Python employs.\n\n### String Comparison in Python\n\n1. **Character by Character Comparison**: When Python compares strings, it initially compares them character by character. If the first characters are different, the comparison can terminate early, which is why non-matching strings might seem faster in certain cases.\n\n2. **Short-circuiting**: For non-matching strings, as soon as a mismatch is found, the comparison stops. In your example, `\"toto\" == \"1234\"`, Python determines the strings are not equal after the first character comparison (`'t' != '1'`).\n\n3. **Full Comparison**: For matching strings, Python has to check every character to confirm equality, which might seem like it should take longer.\n\n### Why Matching Strings Can Be Faster\n\n1. **Caching and Optimizations**: Python implements certain optimizations, such as interning of strings. When strings are interned, Python can quickly determine if they are identical by checking their memory addresses, which can make the comparison for identical strings faster.\n\n2. **Hashing**: While string comparison itself is not hash-based, Python does use hashing internally for objects like dictionary keys. However, hashing is not used directly in basic string equality checks.\n\n3. **CPU Cache and Branch Prediction**: Modern CPUs have sophisticated caching and branch prediction mechanisms. The sequence of operations for comparing two identical strings may benefit more from these optimizations, leading to quicker execution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe difference in timing likely results from a combination of Python's optimizations and how modern CPUs execute instructions. While non-matching strings can terminate early, the optimizations applied to identical strings can result in faster comparisons overall. This kind of behavior highlights the complexity of performance considerations in high-level languages like Python."
