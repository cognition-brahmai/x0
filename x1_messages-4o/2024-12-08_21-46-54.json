        "content": "You can use a combination of shell commands to generate a password that adheres to your specified rules. Here's a bash command that should fulfill your requirements:\n\n```bash\nshuf -e {a..m} -n1 | tr -d '\\n' && shuf -e {n..z} -n1 | tr -d '\\n' && shuf -e {a..z} -n2 | tr -d '\\n' && num1=$(shuf -i 1-9 -n1) && echo -n $num1 && shuf -i 1-9 -n3 | grep -v $num1 | tr -d '\\n' && echo -n $num1 && shuf -e {a..z} -n1 | tr -d '\\n' && echo\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `shuf -e {a..m} -n1` picks one random letter from a to m.\n- `shuf -e {n..z} -n1` picks one random letter from n to z.\n- `shuf -e {a..z} -n2` picks two additional random, non-repeating lowercase letters.\n- `num1=$(shuf -i 1-9 -n1)` picks a random number from 1 to 9 and stores it in `num1`.\n- `echo -n $num1` outputs the stored number without a newline.\n- `shuf -i 1-9 -n3 | grep -v $num1` picks three additional unique numbers, excluding `num1`.\n- `echo -n $num1` outputs the first special character (same as the first number).\n- `shuf -e {a..z} -n1` picks a random letter for the last special character.\n- `echo` completes the command by outputting the final newline.\n\nPlease note that the command assumes each character set is properly shuffled and selected without repetition. Also, the part where it matches special characters to numbers and letters is simplified for this example. You may need to adjust the logic to meet some specific conditions or if the output needs further refinement."
