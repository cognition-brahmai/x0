I pickled my Neural Network model in a Python program and then tried to load the model in another Python file for the Flask application. However, I am encountering an error with the pickler, `AttributeError: module '__main__' has no attribute 'NeuralNetwork'`. Why is the main module of the program getting involved with my NeuralNetwork model and how can I fix this error?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering typically occurs when using the `pickle` module to serialize and deserialize objects, especially when the class definitions of the objects being pickled are not available in the scope where you're trying to unpickle them. In your case, it seems like the `NeuralNetwork` class is not being recognized when you attempt to load the pickled model in your Flask application.\n\nHere are some steps and tips to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Class Definition is Available:**\n   Ensure that the `NeuralNetwork` class is defined in the same module or imported properly in the script where you're trying to load the pickled model. The class must be available in the namespace at the time of unpickling.\n\n2. **Import the Class:**\n   If your `NeuralNetwork` class is defined in a separate module, make sure to import it in your Flask application script before you unpickle the model.\n\n   ```python\n   from your_module import NeuralNetwork\n   ```\n\n3. **Use `__name__ == '__main__'`:**\n   When you define your class and save your model, make sure that the code is protected with `if __name__ == '__main__':`. This ensures that your script can be imported without executing the script-level code, which is useful for separating your model training and deployment logic.\n\n4. **Use `joblib` Instead of `pickle`:**\n   Sometimes, using `joblib` for saving and loading models can be more reliable, especially for scikit-learn models and larger objects. You can install `joblib` using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install joblib\n   ```\n\n   Example usage:\n\n   ```python\n   import joblib\n\n   # Save the model\n   joblib.dump(model, 'model.pkl')\n\n   # Load the model\n   model = joblib.load('model.pkl')\n   ```\n\n5. **Check Relative Imports:**\n   If your project is organized as a package, ensure that any relative imports are correctly handled, and that your Flask app is correctly set up to recognize these.\n\n6. **Test in a Minimal Environment:**\n   Create a minimal script to test pickling and unpickling to isolate the problem. Once it works in the minimal setup, integrate it into your Flask app.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `AttributeError` and successfully load your pickled model in your Flask application."
