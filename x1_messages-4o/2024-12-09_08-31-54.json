My usual way to \"exercise\" it is with existing pytest tests. However, when I run these tests, I don't seem to able to see any standard output, at least from within PyCharm, my IDE. Is there a simple way to see standard output during a pytest run?"

        "content": "Yes, you can see the print output during a pytest run by using a few different approaches. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using the `-s` option**: The simplest way to see the print output is to run your pytest with the `-s` option. This option tells pytest not to capture output, allowing you to see the print statements in the console.\n\n   ```bash\n   pytest -s\n   ```\n\n   If you are using PyCharm, you can add `-s` to the additional arguments in the run configuration for your test.\n\n2. **Using `capsys` fixture**: If you want to capture the output in your tests, you can use the `capsys` fixture provided by pytest. This method allows you to capture and then print or assert the output.\n\n   ```python\n   def test_example(capsys):\n       print(\"Hello, World!\")\n       captured = capsys.readouterr()\n       assert \"Hello, World!\" in captured.out\n   ```\n\n3. **Configuring PyCharm**: If you're using PyCharm, ensure that the \"Redirect output to console\" option is enabled in your run configuration. This will help you see the output without any additional arguments.\n\n4. **Using Logging**: Instead of using print statements, consider using Python's `logging` module. pytest can be configured to show log output by using the `--log-cli-level` option.\n\n   ```bash\n   pytest --log-cli-level=INFO\n   ```\n\n   This way, you can control the verbosity of the output and integrate it better with existing logging configurations.\n\nBy using these methods, you should be able to see the print output during your pytest runs."
