        "content": "I am working on a task in Python where I need to get the date of the previous month. The code I currently have is `str( time.strftime('%Y') ) + str( int(time.strftime('%m'))-1 )`. However, this solution has two issues: it returns 20122 for February of 2012 instead of 201202 and it returns 0 instead of 12 for January. I was able to find a solution in bash using `echo $(date -d\"3 month ago\" \"+%G%m%d\")`. I am hoping to find a more elegant solution in Python without having to write my own script. Here's another solution I thought of, but haven't tested and would prefer not to use:\n\n```\nif int(time.strftime('%m')) == 1:\n    return '12'\nelse:\n    if int(time.strftime('%m')) < 10:\n        return '0'+str(time.strftime('%m')-1)\n    else:\n        return str(time.strftime('%m') -1)\n```\nIs there a better way to solve this problem in Python?"

        "content": "Yes, there is a more elegant way to solve this problem in Python using the `datetime` module. You can calculate the previous month by subtracting a month using `relativedelta` from the `dateutil` package, which handles the edge cases for you (like moving from January to December of the previous year). Here's how you can do it:\n\nFirst, you'll need to install the `python-dateutil` package if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\npip install python-dateutil\n```\n\nThen, you can use the following Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta\n\n# Get the current date\ncurrent_date = datetime.now()\n\n# Subtract one month\nprevious_month_date = current_date - relativedelta(months=1)\n\n# Format the previous month date\nprevious_month_str = previous_month_date.strftime('%Y%m')\n\nprint(previous_month_str)\n```\n\nThis code snippet will give you the year and month of the previous month in the format `YYYYMM`, and it will handle the transition from January to December properly."
