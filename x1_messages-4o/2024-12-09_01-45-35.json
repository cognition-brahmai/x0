Despite having my tests discoverable from tests.py, having tests.py in the same folder as models.py, and my test class subclassing TestCase, when I run `manage.py test <myapp>`, it doesn't find any tests. I've tried subclassing the Django TestCase class as well but to no avail. I'm using Django 1.1.1, Python 2.6 and Snow Leopard. I have also tried having all my tests in their own package but have simplified it down to all tests just being in my tests.py file. Here's the current tests.py file:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\nfrom pyDietTracker.models import Weight\nfrom pyDietTracker.weight.DisplayDataAdapters import DisplayWeight\n\nclass TestDisplayWeight(unittest.TestCase):\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        pass\n\n    def tearDown(self):\n        pass\n\n    def testGetWeightInStone_KG_Correctly_Converted(self):\n        weight = Weight()\n        weight.weight = 99.8\n\n        testAdapter = DisplayWeight(weight)\n        self.assertEquals(testAdapter.GetWeightInStone(), '15 st 10 lb')   \n```\n\nAlso, here is my installed apps configuration:\n\n```python\nINSTALLED_APPS = (\n'django.contrib.auth',\n'django.contrib.contenttypes',\n'django.contrib.sessions',\n'django.contrib.sites',\n'django.contrib.admin',\n'pyDietTracker',\n )\n```\n\nI run the tests with the command `manage.py test pyDietTracker`. What am I missing here?"

        "content": "It seems like you're encountering an issue with your tests not being discovered by Django's test runner. Here are a few things you can consider to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Use Django's TestCase**: Since you're using Django, it's better to use `django.test.TestCase` instead of `unittest.TestCase`. This ensures that you have access to all of Django's test features, including database setup and teardown. Change your import and class definition to:\n\n    ```python\n    from django.test import TestCase\n    from pyDietTracker.models import Weight\n    from pyDietTracker.weight.DisplayDataAdapters import DisplayWeight\n\n    class TestDisplayWeight(TestCase):\n        # your tests\n    ```\n\n2. **Ensure Test Discovery**: Make sure your test methods are prefixed with `test_`. Django's test runner looks for methods that start with `test`.\n\n3. **Correct Django Version**: You're using Django 1.1.1, which is quite old. However, even in older versions, the discovery should work if the naming conventions are followed. Consider upgrading to a newer version if possible, as it will have better support and features.\n\n4. **Check Python Path**: Ensure that your app is correctly added to the Python path. The directory containing `manage.py` should be in the Python path when you run the tests.\n\n5. **Verify `tests.py` Location**: Make sure your `tests.py` file is in the correct directory, typically inside your app directory (`pyDietTracker` in your case).\n\n6. **Review Errors or Output**: Sometimes, there are hints in the command-line output that can indicate what might be going wrong. Double-check any warnings or errors printed when you run `manage.py test`.\n\n7. **Debugging with Verbose Mode**: Try running the tests with more verbosity to see if there are any additional helpful messages:\n\n    ```bash\n    python manage.py test pyDietTracker --verbosity=2\n    ```\n\n8. **Check for Other Issues**: Ensure that there are no syntax errors or import issues in your `tests.py` file or other parts of your application that might be hindering the test discovery.\n\nBy ensuring these points, you should be able to get your tests discovered and executed. If issues persist, further investigate any discrepancies in how the project is set up regarding naming and structure."
