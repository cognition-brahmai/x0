I've installed Jupyter Notebook using pip3 and can execute the 'jupyter notebook' command successfully. The notebook opens and displays a list of the current path directories. However, when I try to create a new notebook (Python3), it throws an error. The error message is as follows: \"Unexpected error while saving file: Deep Learning/NN/Untitled.ipynb [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/home/ubuntu/.local/share/jupyter/notebook_secret'\". How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering suggests that Jupyter Notebook is facing a permission issue when trying to save the notebook file. This is often related to the permissions of the directories or files involved. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Permissions:**\n   - Use the terminal to navigate to the directory where you're trying to save the notebook. For example:\n     ```bash\n     cd /home/ubuntu/.local/share/jupyter\n     ```\n   - Check the permissions of the directory and files using:\n     ```bash\n     ls -la\n     ```\n   - Ensure that the user running Jupyter Notebook has write permissions. You can change the permissions if needed:\n     ```bash\n     sudo chmod -R u+w /home/ubuntu/.local/share/jupyter\n     ```\n\n2. **Change Ownership:**\n   - If the directory or files are owned by another user, you can change the ownership to the current user:\n     ```bash\n     sudo chown -R $(whoami) /home/ubuntu/.local/share/jupyter\n     ```\n\n3. **Check Disk Space:**\n   - Ensure that there is enough disk space available, as sometimes lack of space can cause such issues:\n     ```bash\n     df -h\n     ```\n\n4. **Recreate the Directory:**\n   - If the issue persists, you can try deleting and recreating the problematic directory:\n     ```bash\n     rm -rf /home/ubuntu/.local/share/jupyter/notebook_secret\n     mkdir -p /home/ubuntu/.local/share/jupyter/notebook_secret\n     ```\n\n5. **Run Jupyter with Elevated Permissions:**\n   - Although not recommended for security reasons, you can run Jupyter Notebook with sudo to see if it resolves the issue temporarily:\n     ```bash\n     sudo jupyter notebook\n     ```\n   - If this works, it indicates a permissions issue that needs to be addressed as described above.\n\n6. **Update Jupyter Notebook:**\n   - Make sure you are using the latest version of Jupyter Notebook:\n     ```bash\n     pip3 install --upgrade jupyter\n     ```\n\n7. **Check for Running Instances:**\n   - Sometimes, leftover instances of Jupyter Notebook may cause issues. Check for any running instances and terminate them:\n     ```bash\n     jupyter notebook list\n     ```\n   - Then, stop any running server using:\n     ```bash\n     jupyter notebook stop <port_number>\n     ```\n\nAfter trying these steps, attempt to create a new notebook again. If the issue persists, it may be helpful to look for additional details in the Jupyter logs or consider reinstalling Jupyter Notebook in a clean environment."
