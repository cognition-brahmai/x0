For example, I want the following conversions:\n\n```\n# 0.04  ->  0.1\n# 0.7   ->  1\n# 1.1   ->  10  \n# 90    ->  100  \n# ...\n```\n\nCurrently, I'm using a hardcoded dictionary to check the range of the input number, but I'm looking for a simpler, preferably one-line, solution. Is there a simple mathematical trick or a specific numpy function that I could use?"

        "content": "To round a number up to the next highest power of 10 in Python, you can use a combination of `math` functions such as `math.ceil` and `math.log10`. Here's a concise and effective way to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef round_up_to_power_of_10(x):\n    if x <= 0:\n        return 0\n    exponent = math.ceil(math.log10(x))\n    return 10 ** exponent\n\n# Test cases\nprint(round_up_to_power_of_10(0.04))  # Output: 0.1\nprint(round_up_to_power_of_10(0.7))   # Output: 1\nprint(round_up_to_power_of_10(1.1))   # Output: 10\nprint(round_up_to_power_of_10(90))    # Output: 100\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Logarithm Base 10**: `math.log10(x)` computes the logarithm of `x` in base 10. This gives you a sense of the order of magnitude of `x`.\n\n2. **Ceiling Function**: `math.ceil` rounds up to the nearest integer. By applying it to the result of `math.log10(x)`, you determine the smallest integer `n` such that `10^n` is greater than or equal to `x`.\n\n3. **Exponentiation**: `10 ** exponent` calculates the power of 10 that is the smallest yet larger than or equal to `x`.\n\nThis approach works effectively for positive numbers and handles floating-point inputs to round them up to the next highest power of ten."
