        "content": "The error you're encountering, `[Errno 61] Connection refused`, typically means that your script is trying to connect to an SMTP server that is not running or is not accessible at the specified address and port. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check the SMTP Server:**\n   - Ensure that there is an SMTP server running on `localhost`. By default, your script is trying to connect to `localhost` on port 25, which is the default SMTP port. If you don't have a mail server running locally, you'll need to specify a different SMTP server.\n\n2. **Using an External SMTP Server:**\n   - If you don't have a local SMTP server, you can use an external one such as Gmail's SMTP server. You would need to update the `SERVER` variable and possibly add authentication:\n     ```python\n     SERVER = \"smtp.gmail.com\"\n     PORT = 587\n     USERNAME = \"your-email@gmail.com\"\n     PASSWORD = \"your-email-password\"\n\n     server = smtplib.SMTP(SERVER, PORT)\n     server.starttls()\n     server.login(USERNAME, PASSWORD)\n     server.sendmail(FROM, TO, message)\n     server.quit()\n     ```\n\n3. **Check Firewall and Security Settings:**\n   - Ensure that no firewall or security settings are blocking the connection to the specified SMTP server.\n\n4. **Python Version:**\n   - Consider upgrading your Python version as Python 2.6 is quite old and might not support some of the features or security protocols required by modern SMTP servers.\n\n5. **Debugging:**\n   - Add debugging to your SMTP connection to get more information:\n     ```python\n     server.set_debuglevel(1)\n     ```\n\n6. **Handling Authentication:**\n   - If your SMTP server requires authentication, make sure you are providing the correct credentials.\n\nHere is an example of how you might modify your script to use Gmail's SMTP server:\n\n```python\nimport smtplib\nimport sys\nimport os\n\nSERVER = \"smtp.gmail.com\"\nPORT = 587\nUSERNAME = \"your-email@gmail.com\"\nPASSWORD = \"your-email-password\"\n\nFROM = USERNAME\nTO = [raw_input(\"To : \")]\n\nSUBJECT = \"Message From \" + os.getlogin()\n\nprint \"Message : (End with ^D)\"\nTEXT = ''\nwhile 1:\n    line = sys.stdin.readline()\n    if not line:\n        break\n    TEXT = TEXT + line\n\n# Prepare actual message\nmessage = \"\"\"\\\nFrom: %s\nTo: %s\nSubject: %s\n\n%s\n\"\"\" % (FROM, \", \".join(TO), SUBJECT, TEXT)\n\n# Send the mail\ntry:\n    server = smtplib.SMTP(SERVER, PORT)\n    server.set_debuglevel(1)  # Enable debug output\n    server.starttls()  # Secure the connection\n    server.login(USERNAME, PASSWORD)\n    server.sendmail(FROM, TO, message)\n    print(\"Email sent successfully\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Failed to send email: {e}\")\nfinally:\n    server.quit()\n```\n\nRemember to replace `\"your-email@gmail.com\"` and `\"your-email-password\"` with your actual email credentials. Make sure you handle your credentials securely and consider using environment variables or a secure vault for storing sensitive information like passwords."
