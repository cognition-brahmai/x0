You notice that the data being returned by the code is not matching what is expected based on the input data. After analyzing the code, you suspect that there is a mistake in the ordering process that is causing the discrepancy.\nTo verify your suspicion, you decide to create a program that generates two different sets of JSON data: one representing the order that the customer received and another representing the description that promised the item. Your program will then compare the two data sets and output any differences found.\nHowever, to make the task more challenging, you decide to encode the JSON data using a secret code that involves substituting certain letters and numbers for others. The code is as follows:\n- A -> %\n- B -> $\n- C -> #\n- D -> @\n- E -> !\n- F -> &\n- G -> *\n- H -> ^\n- I -> <\n- J -> >\n- K -> (\n- L -> )\n- M -> _\n- N -> +\n- O -> -\n- P -> =\n- Q -> {\n- R -> }\n- S -> [\n- T -> ]\n- U -> :\n- V -> ;\n- W -> '\n- X -> \"\n- Y -> \\\n- Z -> ~\n- 0 -> ?\n- 1 -> /\n- 2 -> .\n- 3 -> ,\n- 4 -> ;\n- 5 -> :\n- 6 -> '\n- 7 -> \"\n- 8 -> \\\n- 9 -> -\nYou must decode the JSON data before comparing the two data sets. Good luck!"

Encode these JSON objects using the provided substitution code.\n\n2. **Decode the JSON Data**: Write a function to decode the JSON data back to its original form using the given substitution rules.\n\n3. **Compare the JSON Objects**: Compare the decoded JSON objects to identify any discrepancies between what was promised and what was delivered.\n\nLet's break down each step with some Python code:\n\n### Step 1: Generate and Encode JSON Data\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Sample JSON data\norder_received = {\n    \"item\": \"Laptop\",\n    \"quantity\": 1,\n    \"price\": 1500\n}\n\ndescription_promised = {\n    \"item\": \"Laptop\",\n    \"quantity\": 1,\n    \"price\": 1500\n}\n\n# Encoding function based on the given substitution code\ndef encode_data(data):\n    substitution_code = {\n        'A': '%', 'B': '$', 'C': '#', 'D': '@', 'E': '!', 'F': '&', 'G': '*', 'H': '^',\n        'I': '<', 'J': '>', 'K': '(', 'L': ')', 'M': '_', 'N': '+', 'O': '-', 'P': '=',\n        'Q': '{', 'R': '}', 'S': '[', 'T': ']', 'U': ':', 'V': ';', 'W': \"'\", 'X': '\"',\n        'Y': '\\\\', 'Z': '~', '0': '?', '1': '/', '2': '.', '3': ',', '4': ';', '5': ':',\n        '6': \"'\", '7': '\"', '8': '\\\\', '9': '-'\n    }\n    json_str = json.dumps(data)\n    encoded_str = ''.join(substitution_code.get(char, char) for char in json_str)\n    return encoded_str\n\nencoded_order_received = encode_data(order_received)\nencoded_description_promised = encode_data(description_promised)\n\nprint(\"Encoded Order Received:\", encoded_order_received)\nprint(\"Encoded Description Promised:\", encoded_description_promised)\n```\n\n### Step 2: Decode the JSON Data\n\n```python\n# Decoding function based on the given substitution code\ndef decode_data(encoded_data):\n    reverse_substitution_code = {v: k for k, v in substitution_code.items()}\n    decoded_str = ''.join(reverse_substitution_code.get(char, char) for char in encoded_data)\n    return json.loads(decoded_str)\n\ndecoded_order_received = decode_data(encoded_order_received)\ndecoded_description_promised = decode_data(encoded_description_promised)\n\nprint(\"Decoded Order Received:\", decoded_order_received)\nprint(\"Decoded Description Promised:\", decoded_description_promised)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Compare the JSON Objects\n\n```python\ndef compare_json(obj1, obj2):\n    differences = {}\n    for key in obj1.keys():\n        if key in obj2:\n            if obj1[key] != obj2[key]:\n                differences[key] = {\"received\": obj1[key], \"promised\": obj2[key]}\n        else:\n            differences[key] = {\"received\": obj1[key], \"promised\": None}\n\n    for key in obj2.keys():\n        if key not in obj1:\n            differences[key] = {\"received\": None, \"promised\": obj2[key]}\n    \n    return differences\n\ndifferences = compare_json(decoded_order_received, decoded_description_promised)\nprint(\"Differences:\", differences)\n```\n\nThis code will generate, encode, decode, and compare the JSON data, outputting any discrepancies found between the two data sets. You can modify the sample data to test different scenarios as needed."
