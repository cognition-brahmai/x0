Under 'common' there is a python file named 'foo.py' and under 'src' there is another python file named 'bar.py'. How can I use Python's relative imports to import 'foo' from 'bar'? I've successfully added it to the path but I'm looking for a cleaner solution that involves a single 'import' in Python 2.7."

        "content": "To use relative imports in Python, especially in a structured project as you described, it's important to ensure that your directories are treated as packages. This means you need to have an `__init__.py` file in each directory (i.e., `main`, `common`, `A`, and `src`). The `__init__.py` files can be empty, but their presence allows Python to recognize the directories as packages.\n\nGiven your directory structure:\n\n```\nmain/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 common/\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 foo.py\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 A/\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 src/\n            \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n            \u2514\u2500\u2500 bar.py\n```\n\nTo import `foo` from `bar.py` using relative imports in Python 2.7, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Ensure there are `__init__.py` files in `main`, `common`, `A`, and `src` directories.\n\n2. Inside `bar.py`, you can use relative imports like this:\n\n```python\n# bar.py\nfrom ...common import foo\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of how this works:\n\n- The `...` in `from ...common` indicates that Python should look three levels up from `bar.py` and then look for the `common` package at that level.\n- This approach assumes that you are running your script from the `main` directory or that `main` is in your Python path.\n\nNote that relative imports require that your modules be part of a package structure, and the script is executed in a way that the package hierarchy is respected (e.g., using the `-m` option or setting the appropriate working directory).\n\nPython 2.7 has some limitations with regard to relative imports, and if possible, consider upgrading to Python 3 for better support and features."
