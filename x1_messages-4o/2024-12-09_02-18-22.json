However, I noticed that the cross entropy for binary cases is formulated differently. When I write code according to this formula, I get different results. I am wondering which method is better or more accurate? Does TensorFlow offer a function to compute the cross entropy according to the binary case formula as well?"

        "content": "In TensorFlow, the function `tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits_v2` is designed for multi-class classification problems where there are more than two classes. It computes the cross-entropy loss by first applying the softmax function to the logits to obtain probabilities and then computing the cross-entropy loss between these probabilities and the true labels.\n\nFor binary classification problems, the formulation is slightly different. Instead of using softmax, the sigmoid activation function is typically used, and the corresponding loss function is binary cross-entropy. In TensorFlow, you can use the function `tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits` for binary classification tasks. This function directly computes the binary cross-entropy loss from logits, applying the sigmoid function internally.\n\nHere's a brief comparison:\n\n- `tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits_v2`: Suitable for multi-class classification. It applies softmax to the logits and computes the cross-entropy loss.\n\n- `tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits`: Suitable for binary classification. It applies sigmoid to the logits and computes the binary cross-entropy loss.\n\nIf you're working with a binary classification problem, it would be more accurate and efficient to use `tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits`. This function is tailored specifically for binary cases and avoids the unnecessary computation of the softmax function, which is designed for multi-class scenarios.\n\nIn summary, for binary classification, use `tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits`. For multi-class classification, use `tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits_v2`. This approach not only ensures accuracy but also aligns with the mathematical formulations typically used for each type of problem."
