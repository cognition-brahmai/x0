        "content": "In Python, I'm using a lot of N dimensional arrays and often find myself writing indented code. I'm aware that some codes can be replaced with list comprehensions and inline statements and I'm trying to do the same. I want to replace the action of printing with adding the numbers instead. For example, I want to replace this code:\n\n<pre><code>\nfor x in (0,1,2,3):\n    for y in (0,1,2,3):\n        if x &lt; y:\n            print (x, y, x*y)\n</code></pre>\n\nwith something like this:\n\n<pre><code>\n[(total+=x+y) for x in (0,1,2,3) for y in (0,1,2,3) if x &lt; y]\n</code></pre>\n\nHowever, this doesn't work. Is there a smarter way to achieve this?"

        "content": "In Python, list comprehensions are great for generating lists, but they aren't suitable for statements or operations that don't directly result in a list, such as accumulating a sum. Instead, you can use the `sum()` function with a generator expression to achieve your goal. Here's how you can modify your code to sum `x + y` whenever `x < y`:\n\n```python\ntotal = sum(x + y for x in (0, 1, 2, 3) for y in (0, 1, 2, 3) if x < y)\n```\n\nThis approach uses a generator expression inside the `sum()` function, which iterates over the same range of values and adds `x + y` to the total whenever `x < y`. This way, you obtain the sum without explicitly writing a loop."
