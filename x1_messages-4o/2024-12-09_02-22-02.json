        "content": "The error message you're encountering indicates that the Python installation is missing the SSL module, which is essential for secure connections required by `pip` to download packages. This often happens when Python is compiled from source without the necessary SSL libraries. Here\u2019s how to resolve this issue:\n\n### Solution Steps:\n\n1. **Install SSL Development Libraries:**\n   Ensure that the OpenSSL development libraries are installed on your system. You need these libraries during the compilation of Python to enable SSL support. You can install them using a package manager.\n\n   For Ubuntu/Debian:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install libssl-dev\n   sudo apt-get install libffi-dev\n   sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev\n   ```\n\n   For CentOS/RHEL:\n   ```bash\n   sudo yum install openssl-devel\n   sudo yum install libffi-devel\n   sudo yum install zlib-devel\n   ```\n\n2. **Recompile Python with SSL:**\n   If you installed Python from source, you need to recompile it. Make sure the SSL libraries are available during this process.\n\n   ```bash\n   cd /path/to/Python-3.x.x\n   make clean  # Clean previous builds\n   ./configure --enable-optimizations\n   make -j 4  # Adjust the number to the number of cores you have\n   sudo make altinstall\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify SSL Module:**\n   After recompiling, verify that the SSL module is available in Python.\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.x -c \"import ssl; print(ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION)\"\n   ```\n\n   If the SSL module imports without errors and prints the OpenSSL version, SSL is correctly configured.\n\n4. **Use the Correct Python and pip Versions:**\n   Ensure you are using the correct version of `pip` associated with your desired Python installation. You can specify the version explicitly.\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.6 -m pip install <package>\n   ```\n\n5. **Check Environment Variables:**\n   Sometimes, environment variables can affect the Python and pip being used. Check your `PATH` and `PYTHONPATH` to ensure they point to the correct installation directories.\n\n6. **Reinstall Python Using Package Manager (Optional):**\n   If recompiling is not an option or is too complex, consider reinstalling Python using a package manager that typically handles these dependencies automatically.\n\n   For Ubuntu/Debian:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install python3.x\n   sudo apt-get install python3.x-dev\n   ```\n\n7. **Check for a Virtual Environment:**\n   If you are working within a virtual environment, ensure it is set up correctly to use the system packages.\n\nBy ensuring the SSL development libraries are available and recompiling Python, you should be able to resolve this issue and successfully install packages using `pip`."
