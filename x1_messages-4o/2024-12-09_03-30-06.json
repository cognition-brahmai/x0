        "content": "I am encountering a 'SyntaxError: invalid token' issue when I attempt to assign a date value to a variable in Python. I've tried to store the date as both a tuple and a list in the format (year, month, day), but both attempts are unsuccessful. The code I have used is as follows:\n\n```python\na = (2016,04,03)  # Assigning date to variable 'a' as a tuple.\n```\nThis results in a SyntaxError: invalid token. Similarly, when I try to store the date as a list:\n\n```python\na = [2016,04,03]  # Assigning date to variable 'a' as a list.\n```\nI receive the same SyntaxError. I am not sure why this is happening, how to fix it or what the term 'token' means in Python. Can you provide some insight?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to how Python interprets numbers with leading zeros. In Python, numbers that start with a zero are treated as octal (base 8) numbers, which was allowed in Python 2 but is not valid in Python 3. As of Python 3, using a leading zero in a number without specifying it as a different base (like binary, octal, or hexadecimal) results in a `SyntaxError`.\n\nIn your case, `04` is being interpreted as an invalid octal number, leading to the `SyntaxError: invalid token`.\n\nTo fix this issue, simply remove the leading zeros from the numbers. Here's how you can correct your code:\n\nFor the tuple:\n\n```python\na = (2016, 4, 3)  # Assigning date to variable 'a' as a tuple.\n```\n\nFor the list:\n\n```python\na = [2016, 4, 3]  # Assigning date to variable 'a' as a list.\n```\n\nRegarding the term \"token,\" in Python (and programming in general), a token is a basic element of the syntax, like keywords, identifiers, literals, and operators. A `SyntaxError` usually means there's a problem with how these tokens are arranged in your code, making it invalid according to the language's grammar rules. In this case, the invalid token was the number with a leading zero."
