I tried to implement it by directly copying the code from the documentation, which is as follows:\n\n```python\nPoint = namedtuple('Point', 'x,y')\n\np = Point(x=11, y=22)\n\np._replace(x=33)\n\nprint p\n```\n\nHowever, when I ran the code, the output I received was `Point(x=11, y=22)`. I was expecting to see `Point(x=33, y=22)` as per the documentation. Can anyone explain why this is happening?"

        "content": "The behavior you're encountering is due to how the `_replace()` function works with `namedtuple` in Python. The `_replace()` method does not modify the original instance in place. Instead, it returns a new instance of the named tuple with the specified fields replaced.\n\nHere's how you can achieve the expected outcome:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import namedtuple\n\nPoint = namedtuple('Point', 'x,y')\n\np = Point(x=11, y=22)\n\n# Use the _replace method and assign the result to a new variable\np_replaced = p._replace(x=33)\n\nprint p_replaced  # Output should be Point(x=33, y=22)\n```\n\nIn this modified code, the `p_replaced` variable holds the new `Point` instance with the `x` field replaced by `33`. The original `p` remains unchanged. If you want to update `p` itself, you can simply assign the result back to `p`:\n\n```python\np = p._replace(x=33)\n\nprint p  # Output: Point(x=33, y=22)\n```\n\nThis way, you achieve the desired modification of the instance."
