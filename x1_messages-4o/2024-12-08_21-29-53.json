        "content": "To determine the maximum speed the rocket would need to achieve to avoid being sucked into the event horizon of a black hole with a mass of 100 solar masses, located 1 light year away, we need to consider several aspects of gravitational physics and rocket dynamics.\n\n### Step 1: Gravitational Pull of the Black Hole\n\n1. **Mass of the Black Hole (M):**  \n   \\( M = 100 \\) solar masses  \n   \\( 1 \\text{ solar mass} = 1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\text{ kg} \\)  \n   \\( M_{\\text{black hole}} = 100 \\times 1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\text{ kg} = 1.989 \\times 10^{32} \\text{ kg} \\)\n\n2. **Gravitational Constant (G):**  \n   \\( G = 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ Nm}^2/\\text{kg}^2 \\)\n\n3. **Distance (r):**  \n   1 light year = \\( 9.461 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ m} \\)\n\n4. **Schwarzschild Radius (r_s):**  \n   \\( r_s = \\frac{2GM}{c^2} \\)  \n   Where \\( c = 3 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m/s} \\) (speed of light)\n\n   \\[\n   r_s = \\frac{2 \\times 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\times 1.989 \\times 10^{32}}{(3 \\times 10^8)^2} \\approx 2.95 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 2: Escape Velocity from the Black Hole's Gravitational Influence\n\nTo escape the gravitational pull, the rocket's speed \\( v \\) should satisfy:\n\n\\[\nv = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nv = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\times 1.989 \\times 10^{32}}{9.461 \\times 10^{15}}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nv \\approx 1.42 \\times 10^4 \\text{ m/s}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Rocket Dynamics\n\nTo achieve this velocity, we use the thrust equation:\n\n\\[\nF = ma \\Rightarrow a = \\frac{F}{m} = \\frac{10,000 \\times 10^3}{5,000} = 2,000 \\text{ m/s}^2\n\\]\n\nUsing the kinematic equation \\( v = u + at \\) (where initial velocity \\( u = 0 \\)):\n\n\\[\n1.42 \\times 10^4 = 0 + 2000t \\Rightarrow t \\approx 7.1 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Effects of Time Dilation and Gravitational Lensing\n\n- **Time Dilation:** Time for the rocket would appear to slow down as it approaches the black hole due to relativistic effects. The closer it gets to the event horizon, the more significant the time dilation effect.\n\n- **Gravitational Lensing:** As the rocket approaches, the trajectory could be bent due to the intense gravitational field. This would require constant adjustment of the rocket's trajectory to maintain a safe path.\n\nThe rocket must maintain constant thrust to counteract the gravitational pull while making necessary adjustments to its trajectory to compensate for gravitational lensing effects. The calculated escape velocity ensures that the rocket can break free from the gravitational influence, but practical navigation through the complex gravitational field would require sophisticated onboard guidance systems."
