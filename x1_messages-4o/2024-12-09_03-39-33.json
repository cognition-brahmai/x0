I've tried using both the IPython.display and matplotlib libraries with the following code, but in both cases, nothing is displayed and no error messages are generated. What am I doing wrong?\n\nFor IPython.display, I tried:\n\n```python\nfrom IPython.display import display, Image\ndisplay(Image(filename='MyImage.png'))\n```\n\nAnd for matplotlib:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.image as mpimg\nplt.imshow(mpimg.imread('MyImage.png'))\n```"

        "content": "Let's go through both methods you've tried and ensure everything is set up correctly.\n\n### Using `IPython.display`\n\n1. **Ensure the File Path is Correct**: Double-check that `'MyImage.png'` is located in the current working directory or provide the full path to the image file.\n\n2. **Use `display()` Correctly**: The code you've written should work in an environment like Jupyter Notebook. Make sure you are running this in a Jupyter Notebook or a compatible environment like JupyterLab.\n\nIf you're running it in a script or a different environment, you might not see the output.\n\n### Using `matplotlib`\n\n1. **Ensure the File Path is Correct**: Like before, ensure the file path to `'MyImage.png'` is correct.\n\n2. **Display the Image**: You need to call `plt.show()` after `plt.imshow()` to display the image.\n\nHere's the corrected code for `matplotlib`:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.image as mpimg\n\nimg = mpimg.imread('MyImage.png')\nplt.imshow(img)\nplt.axis('off')  # Optional: to hide axis\nplt.show()       # This is needed to display the image\n```\n\n### Additional Troubleshooting\n\n- **Check Environment**: Make sure you're running the code in an environment that supports image display, like Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or a Python IDE that supports graphical output.\n\n- **Check Image Format**: Ensure that `'MyImage.png'` is indeed a valid image file and not corrupted.\n\n- **Output Messages**: If there are no error messages, you might want to see if there are warnings or logs that provide clues. You can enable logging or check the console for any subtle hints.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to display the image using either method. If you still encounter issues, try with a different image file to rule out file-specific problems."
