Assume the freelancer charges $500 for each web page design, $250 for each logo design, and $100 for each graphic design. \nHere's a Swift code that calculates the estimated cost based on the given specifications:\nlet webPageDesignCost = 500\nlet logoDesignCost = 250\nlet graphicDesignCost = 100\nlet totalWebPageDesignCost = webPageDesignCost * 3\nlet totalLogoDesignCost = logoDesignCost * 2\nlet totalGraphicDesignCost = graphicDesignCost * 5\nlet totalCost = totalWebPageDesignCost + totalLogoDesignCost + totalGraphicDesignCost\nprint(\"The estimated cost for the freelance project is $\\(totalCost)\")"

Here's a breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1. **Web Page Design Cost:**\n   - Cost per web page design: $500\n   - Number of web page designs: 3\n   - Total web page design cost: \\(500 \\times 3 = 1500\\)\n\n2. **Logo Design Cost:**\n   - Cost per logo design: $250\n   - Number of logo designs: 2\n   - Total logo design cost: \\(250 \\times 2 = 500\\)\n\n3. **Graphic Design Cost:**\n   - Cost per graphic design: $100\n   - Number of graphic designs: 5\n   - Total graphic design cost: \\(100 \\times 5 = 500\\)\n\n4. **Total Estimated Cost:**\n   - Total cost: \\(1500 + 500 + 500 = 2500\\)\n\nTherefore, the estimated cost for the freelance project is $2,500."
