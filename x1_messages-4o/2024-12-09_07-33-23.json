For instance, I want to achieve:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `foo` (`bar`) VALUES (1), (2), (3)\n```\n\nInstead of:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO `foo` (`bar`) VALUES (1)\nINSERT INTO `foo` (`bar`) VALUES (2)\nINSERT INTO `foo` (`bar`) VALUES (3)\n```\n\nAfter transitioning some of my code to use SQLAlchemy instead of raw SQL, I've noticed that the performance has decreased by up to a factor of 10 and I'm trying to ascertain if this is due to the way I'm inserting data. I currently have `autoCommit=False` and do a `session.commit()` after adding some data. However, I've noticed that this approach seems to cause the data to become stale if the database is modified elsewhere. Even when I execute a new query, I still get old results. Could I possibly improve this situation by using sessions more efficiently?"

        "content": "Yes, you can implement bulk inserts in SQLAlchemy ORM to improve performance significantly compared to inserting each individual object separately. Here are a few methods you can use:\n\n### Method 1: `session.bulk_save_objects`\n\nSQLAlchemy provides the `bulk_save_objects` method, which can be used to insert multiple objects in a more efficient way than adding them one by one:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\nfrom your_model import YourModel, engine\n\nSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\nsession = Session()\n\n# Assuming `data` is a list of dictionaries with your data\nobjects = [YourModel(**item) for item in data]\n\nsession.bulk_save_objects(objects)\nsession.commit()\n```\n\n### Method 2: `session.bulk_insert_mappings`\n\nAnother efficient method is to use `bulk_insert_mappings`, which requires you to provide the data as mappings (dictionaries):\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\nfrom your_model import YourModel, engine\n\nSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\nsession = Session()\n\n# Assuming `data` is a list of dictionaries with your data\nsession.bulk_insert_mappings(YourModel, data)\nsession.commit()\n```\n\n### Method 3: Using Core Insert with Executemany\n\nIf you're comfortable using the core SQLAlchemy, you can execute a bulk insert using the `executemany` parameter:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import insert\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\nfrom your_model import YourModel, engine\n\nSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\nsession = Session()\n\n# Assuming `data` is a list of dictionaries with your data\nstmt = insert(YourModel).values(data)\nsession.execute(stmt)\nsession.commit()\n```\n\n### Handling Stale Data\n\nRegarding stale data, SQLAlchemy sessions are designed to provide a unit of work pattern, which means that they cache data to minimize database hits. If you want to ensure your session always fetches the latest data from the database, you can:\n\n- Use `session.expire_all()` to expire all instances in the session, forcing a reload from the database the next time they are accessed.\n- Use `session.refresh(instance)` to refresh a specific instance.\n\n### Efficient Use of Sessions\n\nEnsure you are using sessions efficiently by:\n\n- Keeping sessions short-lived and scoped to a single atomic operation.\n- Using a session per request in web applications.\n- Closing sessions with `session.close()` when done to free up resources.\n\nBy utilizing the above methods and practices, you should be able to improve the performance of your bulk insert operations and handle data consistency more effectively."
