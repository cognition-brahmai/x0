        "content": "The issue you're encountering is because you're trying to serialize a `QuerySet` directly using a single-instance serializer. In Django Rest Framework (DRF), when you're dealing with a collection of objects (like a `QuerySet`), you need to tell the serializer to handle multiple objects. This can be done by passing the `many=True` argument to the serializer.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to properly serialize the `QuerySet`:\n\n1. Update the serializer instantiation to handle a list of objects.\n2. Ensure you are using the right response utility to return serialized data.\n\nHere's the corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nfrom django.http import JsonResponse\nfrom django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt\nfrom rest_framework import status\nfrom .serializers import VenueSerializer  # Ensure you import your serializer\n\n@csrf_exempt\ndef venue_list(request, user_id):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check that the user is requesting his own venues.\n    \"\"\"\n    profile = get_profile_for_user_if_match(request.user, user_id)\n\n    if profile is None:\n        return JsonResponse({'detail': 'Unauthorized'}, status=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED)\n\n    venues = profile.venue_set.all()\n    serializer = VenueSerializer(venues, many=True)  # Add many=True here\n\n    return JsonResponse(serializer.data, safe=False)  # Use safe=False for serializing lists\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`many=True` Argument**: When you pass `many=True` to the serializer, it tells the serializer that it should handle multiple objects (a list or queryset) instead of a single object.\n- **`JsonResponse` with `safe=False`**: By default, `JsonResponse` expects the data to be a dictionary (to be safe). When you serialize a list of objects, you should set `safe=False` to allow non-dict objects to be serialized.\n\nEnsure that your `VenueSerializer` is properly defined to handle the fields you need from the `Venue` model. If you continue to face issues, double-check the serializer's field definitions and ensure they match the model's attributes."
