        "content": "To determine the total number of frames in an AVI file using the OpenCV library in Python, you can use the `cv2.VideoCapture` class. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to retrieve various pieces of information from a video file:\n\n1. **Total Number of Frames**: You can use the `cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_COUNT` property to get the total number of frames in the video.\n\n2. **Resolution (Width and Height)**: You can use the `cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH` and `cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT` properties to get the width and height of the frames.\n\n3. **Frames Per Second (FPS)**: The `cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS` property gives you the frames per second of the video.\n\n4. **Duration**: You can calculate the duration of the video by dividing the total number of frames by the FPS.\n\nHere's a sample code that demonstrates how to extract this information:\n\n```python\nimport cv2\n\n# Replace 'your_video.avi' with the path to your video file\nvideo_path = 'your_video.avi'\ncap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)\n\nif not cap.isOpened():\n    print(\"Error: Could not open video.\")\nelse:\n    # Get total number of frames\n    total_frames = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_COUNT))\n    \n    # Get width and height of frames\n    width = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH))\n    height = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT))\n    \n    # Get frames per second (fps)\n    fps = cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)\n    \n    # Calculate duration in seconds\n    duration = total_frames / fps if fps > 0 else 0\n\n    # Print the retrieved information\n    print(f\"Total Frames: {total_frames}\")\n    print(f\"Resolution: {width} x {height}\")\n    print(f\"Frames per Second (FPS): {fps}\")\n    print(f\"Duration (seconds): {duration:.2f}\")\n\n# Release the video capture object\ncap.release()\n```\n\nThis script will print out the total number of frames, the resolution, the frames per second, and the duration of the video. Make sure to replace `'your_video.avi'` with the actual path to your video file. Keep in mind that the FPS value can sometimes be unreliable, especially if the video file is corrupted or encoded in an unusual way."
