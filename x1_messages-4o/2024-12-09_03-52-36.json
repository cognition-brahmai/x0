However, when I try to calculate the profit using a for loop, I encounter an `AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'cost'`. Why is it referring to a list when everything seems to be defined? Here's my code:\n\n```python\nclass Bike(object):\n    def __init__(self, name, weight, cost):\n        self.name = name\n        self.weight = weight\n        self.cost = cost\n\nbikes = {\n    # Bike designed for children\"\n    \"Trike\": [\"Trike\", 20, 100],\n    # Bike designed for everyone\"\n    \"Kruzer\": [\"Kruzer\", 50, 165]\n    }\n    \n# Markup of 20% on all sales\nmargin = .2\n# Revenue minus cost after sale\nfor bike in bikes.values():\n    profit = bike.cost * margin\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the way you've structured your dictionary of bikes. The values in the dictionary are lists, and you're trying to access them as if they were objects with attributes. In your code, `bikes` is a dictionary where each key maps to a list containing the bike's name, weight, and cost. However, you need to create instances of the `Bike` class for each entry instead of using lists.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can fix your code by using instances of the `Bike` class:\n\n```python\nclass Bike(object):\n    def __init__(self, name, weight, cost):\n        self.name = name\n        self.weight = weight\n        self.cost = cost\n\n# Create instances of the Bike class and store them in the dictionary\nbikes = {\n    \"Trike\": Bike(\"Trike\", 20, 100),  # Bike designed for children\n    \"Kruzer\": Bike(\"Kruzer\", 50, 165)  # Bike designed for everyone\n}\n\n# Markup of 20% on all sales\nmargin = 0.2\n\n# Calculate profit for each bike\nfor bike in bikes.values():\n    profit = bike.cost * margin\n    print(f\"Profit for {bike.name}: {profit}\")\n```\n\nIn this corrected version:\n\n- Each bike in the `bikes` dictionary is an instance of the `Bike` class, so you can access the `cost` attribute directly.\n- The loop correctly calculates the profit for each bike using `bike.cost`.\n- The `print` statement outputs the profit for each bike, making it easy to see the results.\n\nThis should resolve the `AttributeError` you experienced, and your profit calculation should work as expected."
