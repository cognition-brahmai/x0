However, I am facing an issue where the HTML fetched through Python requests is different from the one viewed through my browser for the same page. Notably, the HTML obtained through Python requests lacks the last six <img> tags and doesn't include navigation and footer sections. I have already checked if request headers or JavaScript loading could be causing this discrepancy but with no success. Could you explain why this is happening and suggest a way to fix it?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is common when scraping websites that heavily rely on JavaScript for rendering content. Many modern websites, including Wikia, dynamically load content using JavaScript, which is executed in the browser. When you use the `requests` library in Python, it only retrieves the static HTML that is initially sent by the server, without executing any JavaScript. This can result in missing content such as images, navigation, and footer sections.\n\nHere are a few approaches you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Use a Headless Browser**:\n   - One effective solution is to use a headless browser that can execute JavaScript, such as Selenium with a browser driver (e.g., ChromeDriver or GeckoDriver).\n   - Selenium allows you to automate a real browser, which will render the page fully, including executing JavaScript and loading dynamic content.\n\n   Here's a basic example using Selenium with Chrome:\n\n   ```python\n   from selenium import webdriver\n   from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service\n   from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager\n\n   # Set up the WebDriver\n   service = Service(ChromeDriverManager().install())\n   options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()\n   options.add_argument('--headless')  # Run in headless mode\n   driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=service, options=options)\n\n   # Navigate to the page\n   driver.get('https://your-wikia-page-url')\n\n   # Get the complete HTML\n   html = driver.page_source\n\n   # Don't forget to close the driver\n   driver.quit()\n\n   print(html)\n   ```\n\n2. **API Access**:\n   - Check if Wikia provides any API that you can use to fetch the content programmatically. APIs often provide structured data and can be more reliable than web scraping.\n\n3. **Use a Different Library**:\n   - Consider using libraries like `pyppeteer` (a Python port of Puppeteer) that can render JavaScript-heavy pages.\n\n4. **Check for AJAX Calls**:\n   - Inspect the network activity in your browser's developer tools to see if additional AJAX calls are made to load the missing content. You might replicate these requests using `requests`.\n\n5. **Headers and Cookies**:\n   - Ensure that your `requests` headers are set to mimic a real browser as closely as possible. Sometimes missing headers (like `User-Agent`) or cookies can lead to different content being served.\n\nBy using a headless browser or similar tools, you should be able to capture the fully rendered HTML as seen in your browser."
