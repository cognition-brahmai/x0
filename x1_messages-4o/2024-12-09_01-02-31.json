        "content": "The error message you're encountering is due to the fact that you're trying to use a namespace in your `include()` function without specifying an `app_name`. Since Django 1.9, if you want to use a namespace, you must provide an `app_name` in your app's `urls.py`.\n\nTo fix this, you need to define an `app_name` in your app's `urls.py` file. Here's how you can modify your `app/urls.py`:\n\n```python\n# app/urls.py\n\nfrom django.conf.urls import url\nfrom . import views\n\napp_name = 'reviews'  # Add this line to define the app_name\n\nurlpatterns = [\n    # ex: /\n    url(r'^$', views.review_list, name='review_list'),\n    # ex: /review/5/\n    url(r'^review/(?P<review_id>[0-9]+)/$', views.review_detail, name='review_detail'),\n    # ex: /wine/\n    url(r'^wine$', views.wine_list, name='wine_list'),\n    # ex: /wine/5/\n    url(r'^wine/(?P<wine_id>[0-9]+)/$', views.wine_detail, name='wine_detail'),\n]\n```\n\nBy adding `app_name = 'reviews'`, you tell Django that the namespace `'reviews'` should be associated with the URL patterns defined in this module.\n\nWith this change, your `project/urls.py` can remain as it is:\n\n```python\n# project/urls.py\n\nfrom django.conf.urls import include, url\nfrom django.contrib import admin\n\nurlpatterns = [\n    url(r'^reviews/', include('reviews.urls', namespace='reviews')),\n    url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),\n]\n```\n\nNow, when you run the server, Django should correctly recognize the namespace and not raise the `ImproperlyConfiguredError`."
