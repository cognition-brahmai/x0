        "content": "The sky appears blue on a sunny day due to a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it collides with molecules and small particles in the air. Sunlight is made up of different colors, each with different wavelengths. Blue light has a shorter wavelength and is scattered in all directions by the gases and particles in the atmosphere more than other colors, like red or yellow, which have longer wavelengths.\n\nAs a result, when you look up at the sky, you see more blue light scattered across the sky, making it appear blue. During sunrise and sunset, the sun is lower in the sky, and its light has to pass through more atmosphere, which scatters away the shorter blue wavelengths and allows the longer red wavelengths to reach your eyes, making the sky appear reddish-orange."
