This is affecting my productivity significantly. I tried considering Watchdog to monitor file changes and then restart the server, but the `bottle.run` function is blocking. Setting up an external script to watch for file changes and then run the server seems to be a lot of work. How can I get Bottle to restart on file change?"

        "content": "To address the issue of having to manually restart the Bottle server each time you make changes to your code, you can use the `reloader` feature that comes built-in with Bottle. The `reloader` will automatically restart the server whenever it detects a change in your code files. Here's how you can enable it:\n\nWhen you run your Bottle application, you can set the `reloader` parameter to `True` in the `bottle.run()` function. This way, the server will automatically restart whenever a change is detected in your code.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom bottle import Bottle, run\n\napp = Bottle()\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef index():\n    return \"Hello, World!\"\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    run(app, host='localhost', port=8080, reloader=True)\n```\n\nBy setting `reloader=True`, Bottle uses a simple file-watching mechanism to track changes in the files and automatically reload the server whenever changes are detected. This should help you improve your workflow and productivity by eliminating the need for manual restarts.\n\nAdditionally, if you are working in a development environment, make sure to set `debug=True` as well to get more detailed error messages:\n\n```python\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    run(app, host='localhost', port=8080, reloader=True, debug=True)\n```\n\nThis setup should significantly enhance your development experience with Bottle by providing automatic server restarts and detailed debugging information."

For example, `%5d` would format an integer to a width of 5 characters, padding it with spaces if necessary.\n\nBy using these methods, you can format strings in Java in a way that is quite similar to Python's `str.format()` functionality."
