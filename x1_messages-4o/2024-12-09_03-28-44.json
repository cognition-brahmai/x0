        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that you're trying to register two different URL rules with the same endpoint name `'main'`. In Flask, each URL rule must have a unique endpoint name, which is used to generate URLs with `url_for()` and to distinguish between different routes. When you use the same endpoint name for multiple routes, Flask raises an `AssertionError`.\n\nTo resolve this, you need to give each rule a unique endpoint name. You can do this by using a different string for each `as_view()` call. Here is how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\napp.add_url_rule('/',\n                 view_func=Main.as_view('main_index'),\n                 methods=[\"GET\"])\n\napp.add_url_rule('/<page>/',\n                 view_func=Main.as_view('main_page'),\n                 methods=[\"GET\"])\n```\n\nNow, `'main_index'` and `'main_page'` are unique endpoint names for the two different URL rules, and this should resolve the `AssertionError`. You can still use the same view function class, `Main`, for both routes; just make sure the endpoint names are different."
