        "content": "The formula you're using here seems to be a misunderstanding of how musical scales work in terms of frequency. The formula provided, \\( \\text{(root note frequency)} \\times 2^{(n-1)/12} \\), is actually used to calculate the frequency of a note that is n semitones away from the root note in an equal-tempered scale, not specifically for finding notes in a major scale.\n\nIn a major scale, the intervals between the notes are not evenly spaced by semitones. Instead, the pattern of a major scale follows a sequence of whole and half steps: whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half. This is what gives the major scale its distinctive sound.\n\nFor example, in the C major scale, the notes are: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C. If you want to find the 4th note in the C major scale, you can simply count up the scale: C (1), D (2), E (3), F (4). Therefore, the 4th note is indeed F.\n\nTo find the nth note in a major scale starting from any root note, you would follow the pattern of whole and half steps: \n\n1. Start at the root note.\n2. Move up a whole step (2 semitones) for the second note.\n3. Move up another whole step (2 semitones) for the third note.\n4. Move up a half step (1 semitone) for the fourth note.\n5. Continue with whole, whole, whole, and half steps for notes five through eight.\n\nIf you need to convert this to a frequency, you would use the frequency of the root note and adjust according to the number of semitones away from the root note the desired scale degree is."
