Here's a suggested order:\n\n1. **Rice**: Start by spreading a layer of rice on your tortilla. It's a good base that absorbs flavors and provides texture.\n2. **Beans**: Add the beans on top of the rice. They complement the rice well and add protein.\n3. **Cheese**: Sprinkle cheese over the beans. The warmth from the rice and beans will help melt the cheese slightly.\n4. **Lettuce**: Finally, add the lettuce for a fresh, crunchy texture.\n\nOnce you've arranged these ingredients, you can wrap your burrito and enjoy!"
