        "content": "In Python, the `exit()` function is used to terminate a program. The function can take an optional argument that indicates the exit status of the program. The exit status is a numerical code that signifies whether the program has terminated successfully or encountered an error.\n\nHere\u2019s the difference between `exit(0)` and `exit(1)`:\n\n1. **`exit(0)`**:\n   - Represents a successful termination of the program.\n   - By convention, an exit status of `0` indicates that the program completed successfully without any errors or issues.\n   - It's a way to signal to the operating system or calling process that everything went as expected.\n\n2. **`exit(1)`**:\n   - Represents an unsuccessful termination of the program.\n   - An exit status of `1` (or any non-zero value) indicates that the program encountered an error or an unusual condition that led to its termination.\n   - It's used to signal that something went wrong during the execution of the program.\n\nIn general, when you run a program from a command line or a script, the exit status can be used to check whether the program ran successfully or if there were any problems that need attention. This is particularly useful in scripting and automation, where subsequent actions might depend on the success or failure of a previous command."
