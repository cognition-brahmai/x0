        "content": "To include a non-Python file, such as a license file, in your package using `setup.py`, you'll need to make use of the `package_data` or `include_package_data` options in your setup configuration. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n1. **Organize Your Package Structure:**\n   Ensure that your package structure looks something like this:\n\n   ```\n   your_package/\n       \u251c\u2500\u2500 LICENSE\n       \u251c\u2500\u2500 your_module/\n       \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n       \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 other_files.py\n       \u251c\u2500\u2500 setup.py\n       \u2514\u2500\u2500 other_files...\n   ```\n\n2. **Modify `setup.py`:**\n   You need to specify the non-Python files you want to include. You can do this by using either `package_data` or `include_package_data` with a `MANIFEST.in` file.\n\n   Here's how you can do it with `package_data`:\n\n   ```python\n   from setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\n   setup(\n       name='your_package',\n       version='0.1',\n       packages=find_packages(),\n       include_package_data=True,\n       package_data={\n           # If any package contains these files, include them:\n           '': ['LICENSE'],\n       },\n   )\n   ```\n\n3. **Alternative Approach using `MANIFEST.in`:**\n   Another way is to use a `MANIFEST.in` file, which is more flexible and allows you to specify files to include in the source distribution:\n\n   - Create a `MANIFEST.in` file in the same directory as your `setup.py`:\n\n     ```\n     include your_package/LICENSE\n     ```\n\n   - Modify your `setup.py` to use `include_package_data=True`:\n\n     ```python\n     from setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\n     setup(\n         name='your_package',\n         version='0.1',\n         packages=find_packages(),\n         include_package_data=True,\n     )\n     ```\n\n4. **Build and Verify:**\n   After setting this up, build your package using:\n\n   ```\n   python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\n   ```\n\n   Then verify that the LICENSE file is included in the built package by inspecting the contents of the distribution file (e.g., `.tar.gz` or `.whl` file).\n\nBy following these steps, your LICENSE file should be included in the package at the root level, alongside your topmost `__init__.py` file, regardless of the operating system."
