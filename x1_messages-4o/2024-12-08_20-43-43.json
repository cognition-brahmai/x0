        "content": "To change the sentence \"He opened the door\" to passive voice, we need to follow specific English grammar rules. Here is the transformation:\n\n**Active Voice:** He opened the door.\n\n**Passive Voice:** The door was opened by him.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n**Active Voice:**\n- In active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the action expressed by the verb. \n- Example: \"The cat chased the mouse.\"\n  - Subject (The cat) performs the action (chased) on the object (the mouse).\n\n**Passive Voice:**\n- In passive voice, the subject of the sentence is acted upon by the verb. The focus is often on the action itself or the object of the action rather than the subject.\n- Example: \"The mouse was chased by the cat.\"\n  - Subject (The mouse) is receiving the action, and the doer (the cat) is optionally mentioned.\n\n### Key Differences:\n1. **Focus:** Active voice emphasizes the doer of the action, while passive voice emphasizes the action or the recipient of the action.\n2. **Sentence Structure:** In active voice, the structure is typically Subject + Verb + Object. In passive voice, it is Object + Form of \"to be\" + Past Participle + (by Subject).\n3. **Clarity and Directness:** Active voice is generally more direct and clearer, while passive voice can sometimes be used to be more formal or when the doer is unknown or irrelevant.\n\nBy understanding these differences, you can choose which voice to use based on the focus and clarity you want to achieve in your writing."
