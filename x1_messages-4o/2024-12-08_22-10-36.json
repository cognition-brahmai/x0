Additionally, the function should exclude any prepositions, conjunctions, and articles in both languages. Please include the function definition and an example of how to use the function on a sample sentence with at least 5 words in each language."

        "content": "Certainly! To calculate the average word length of a sentence containing both English and Spanish words, excluding prepositions, conjunctions, and articles, we can define a Python function as follows:\n\n```python\ndef average_word_length(sentence):\n    # Define lists of prepositions, conjunctions, and articles in English and Spanish\n    english_exclusions = {'a', 'an', 'the', 'and', 'or', 'but', 'on', 'in', 'at', 'for', 'with', 'about', 'against', 'between', 'into', 'through', 'during', 'before', 'after', 'above', 'below', 'to', 'from', 'up', 'down', 'over', 'under', 'again', 'further', 'then', 'once'}\n    spanish_exclusions = {'un', 'una', 'unos', 'unas', 'el', 'la', 'los', 'las', 'y', 'o', 'pero', 'en', 'con', 'a', 'por', 'para', 'de', 'sobre', 'entre', 'durante', 'antes', 'despu\u00e9s', 'arriba', 'abajo', 'sobre', 'bajo', 'otra', 'vez', 'm\u00e1s', 'entonces', 'una', 'vez'}\n\n    # Tokenize the sentence into words\n    words = sentence.split()\n\n    # Filter out the excluded words\n    valid_words = [word for word in words if word.lower() not in english_exclusions and word.lower() not in spanish_exclusions]\n\n    # Calculate the average word length\n    if valid_words:\n        total_length = sum(len(word) for word in valid_words)\n        average_length = total_length / len(valid_words)\n    else:\n        return 0.0  # Avoid division by zero if no valid words are found\n\n    return average_length\n\n# Example usage:\nsentence = \"The cat y el perro corren r\u00e1pidamente en el jard\u00edn bajo the sun\"\naverage_length = average_word_length(sentence)\nprint(\"Average word length:\", average_length)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Exclusions**: The function defines sets of common prepositions, conjunctions, and articles in both English and Spanish to exclude them from the calculation.\n2. **Tokenization**: The sentence is split into words based on spaces.\n3. **Filtering**: Words that are in the exclusion lists are filtered out.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The average word length is calculated by dividing the total length of the valid words by their count.\n5. **Example Usage**: The example sentence includes words in both English and Spanish, and the function computes the average length of valid words.\n\nYou can test the function with different sentences to see how it performs."
