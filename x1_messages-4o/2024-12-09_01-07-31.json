        "content": "In the Python `unittest` framework, you can use the `assertRaises` method to test that an exception is raised. However, if you want to pass the test when no exception is raised and fail it when an exception is raised, you need to reverse the logic. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\n\nclass MyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):\n    def test_no_exception(self):\n        try:\n            # Call the function that you expect NOT to raise an exception.\n            self.function_that_should_not_raise()\n        except Exception as e:\n            # If an exception is raised, fail the test.\n            self.fail(f\"An unexpected exception was raised: {e}\")\n\n    def function_that_should_not_raise(self):\n        # Example function that does not raise an exception.\n        return \"No exception here!\"\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- The `function_that_should_not_raise` method is expected not to raise any exceptions.\n- The test `test_no_exception` uses a `try-except` block to catch any exceptions.\n- If an exception is caught, `self.fail()` is called with a message, causing the test to fail.\n- If no exceptions are raised, the test will pass.\n\nThis setup successfully tests that no exceptions are raised during the execution of the specified function."
