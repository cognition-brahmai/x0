Here's a recipe to guide you through the process:\n\n### Ingredients:\n\n#### For the Marinade:\n- 1/4 cup hoisin sauce\n- 1/4 cup soy sauce\n- 1/4 cup honey\n- 2 tablespoons Chinese rice wine or dry sherry\n- 1 tablespoon oyster sauce\n- 1 tablespoon sesame oil\n- 1 tablespoon Chinese five-spice powder\n- 1 tablespoon minced garlic\n- 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger\n- 1 teaspoon red food coloring (optional, for traditional red color)\n\n#### For the Pork:\n- 2 pounds pork shoulder or pork tenderloin, cut into strips about 2 inches wide\n\n### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Marinade:**\n   - In a large bowl, combine hoisin sauce, soy sauce, honey, Chinese rice wine, oyster sauce, sesame oil, five-spice powder, minced garlic, grated ginger, and red food coloring (if using).\n   - Mix thoroughly until all ingredients are well combined.\n\n2. **Marinate the Pork:**\n   - Place the pork strips into a large resealable plastic bag or a shallow dish.\n   - Pour the marinade over the pork, ensuring all pieces are well coated.\n   - Seal the bag or cover the dish, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat.\n\n3. **Prepare the Grill:**\n   - Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.\n   - If using charcoal, allow the coals to develop a light layer of ash before grilling.\n\n4. **Grill the Pork:**\n   - Remove the pork from the marinade, allowing any excess to drip off. Reserve the marinade for basting.\n   - Place the pork on the grill and cook for about 15-20 minutes, turning occasionally and basting with the reserved marinade.\n   - Use a meat thermometer to check for doneness; the internal temperature should reach 145\u00b0F (63\u00b0C).\n\n5. **Rest and Serve:**\n   - Once cooked, remove the pork from the grill and let it rest for 5 minutes.\n   - Slice the pork into thin pieces and serve with steamed rice or as part of a larger meal.\n\n### Tips:\n- For an authentic touch, try adding a bit of maltose to the marinade for that classic sticky glaze.\n- Adjust the sweetness or spice level of the marinade according to your personal taste preferences.\n- Leftover Char Siu Pork can be used in fried rice, noodle dishes, or as a filling in bao buns.\n\nEnjoy your homemade grilled Char Siu Pork!"
