Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Sample list with the given structure\noriginal_list = [(50, (2.7387451803816479e-13, 219)) for _ in range(100)]  # Example with 100 elements\n\n# Flatten each tuple\nflattened_list = [(x[0], x[1][0], x[1][1]) for x in original_list]\n\n# Print the result to verify\nprint(flattened_list)\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over each tuple in the `original_list`, and for each tuple `x`, it will create a new tuple by accessing the elements and flattening them into the desired structure. The result is stored in the `flattened_list`."
