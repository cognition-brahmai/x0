        "content": "In Python, you cannot directly define a two-dimensional array with undefined length using the syntax `Matrix = [][]`. This is because Python's lists need to be initialized before you can index into them. Instead, you can define an empty list and append sublists to it as needed. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n1. **Define an Empty List**: Start with an empty list, which will act as your two-dimensional array.\n\n2. **Append Sublists**: Add sublists to this list to represent rows in your matrix.\n\nHere's an example of how you can define and populate a two-dimensional list in Python without initializing its size beforehand:\n\n```python\n# Define an empty two-dimensional list\nmatrix = []\n\n# Append sublists (rows) as needed\nmatrix.append([1, 2, 3])  # First row\nmatrix.append([4, 5, 6])  # Second row\n\n# Access elements\nprint(matrix[0][1])  # Output will be 2\n```\n\nIn this example, `matrix` is initially an empty list. You can then append other lists to it, each representing a row in your two-dimensional array. You can continue to add as many sublists (rows) as needed, and each sublist can have a different number of elements (columns).\n\nIf you need to dynamically construct a matrix with unknown dimensions initially, you can keep appending rows and extending them with columns as needed."
