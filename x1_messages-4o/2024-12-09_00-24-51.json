Every time I run the code, I get a 'TypeError: 'str' object is not callable' error for the final line. Here is the code I am using: \n\n```python\nfrom numpy import *\nfrom matplotlib import *\n\na = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nb = [2, 3, 2, 3, 2]\npyplot.plot(a, b)\npylab.xlabel(\"Time\")\npylab.ylabel(\"Speed\")\n```\n\nIf I change the y to an x in `pylab.ylabel`, everything works fine. If I change the x to a y in `pylab.xlabel`, I get the same error. I verified that `ylabel` function does exist and according to the documentation, a string is the only necessary argument, which is the same as for `xlabel`. What could be the issue here?"

        "content": "The problem you're encountering is likely due to a naming conflict or import issue in your code. When you import everything from a module using `from module import *`, it can lead to unexpected behavior because it imports all the functions and classes into the global namespace, potentially overwriting existing functions or variables.\n\nIn your case, it's possible that you have a variable or function named `ylabel` somewhere in your code that is conflicting with the `ylabel` function from `pylab` or `matplotlib.pyplot`. \n\nHere's how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. Avoid using `from module import *` because it can cause such conflicts. Instead, import only what you need or use aliasing.\n\n2. Use the `matplotlib.pyplot` module directly, which is the recommended way to use Matplotlib for most plotting tasks.\n\nHere is a revised version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\na = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nb = [2, 3, 2, 3, 2]\n\nplt.plot(a, b)\nplt.xlabel(\"Time\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Speed\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\nBy using `plt` as an alias for `matplotlib.pyplot`, you avoid any potential conflicts with other variables or functions named `xlabel` or `ylabel` in your code. Additionally, calling `plt.show()` will display the plot window.\n\nThis should resolve the `TypeError: 'str' object is not callable` error you're experiencing."
