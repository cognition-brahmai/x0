Here is my code: \n\n```python\nfile = 'C:\\\\Exe\\\\First Version\\\\filename.exe'\nos.system(file)\n```\nWhen I run this program, a Windows error is raised: \"can't find the file specified.\" I have discovered that the issue is with the whitespace in the middle of \"First Version\". How can I work around this problem? Also, what if the variable 'file' is being passed as an argument into another function?"

        "content": "When dealing with file paths that contain spaces, a common solution is to enclose the path in double quotes. This ensures that the entire path is treated as a single argument by the command-line interpreter. You can modify your code to include the quotes:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nfile = 'C:\\\\Exe\\\\First Version\\\\filename.exe'\nos.system(f'\"{file}\"')\n```\n\nIf the `file` variable is being passed as an argument to another function, you can handle it in a similar manner by ensuring that the function adds quotes around the path when calling `os.system`. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef run_exe(file_path):\n    os.system(f'\"{file_path}\"')\n\nfile = 'C:\\\\Exe\\\\First Version\\\\filename.exe'\nrun_exe(file)\n```\n\nBy enclosing the path in double quotes, you prevent issues related to spaces in the path when using `os.system`. This approach ensures that the command-line interpreter correctly interprets the entire path as a single argument."
