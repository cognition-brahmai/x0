        "content": "To capture the output of a script while preserving newlines (or converting them to `\\n` for later use with `echo -e`), you can use command substitution with the `$(...)` syntax and adjust the way you handle the output. Here\u2019s how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Preserve Newlines in a Variable:**\n\n   You can use the `IFS` (Internal Field Separator) to preserve newlines when capturing the output into a variable:\n\n   ```bash\n   IFS='' read -r -d '' RESULT < <(./myscript; printf '\\0')\n   ```\n\n   Here, `IFS=''` ensures that leading/trailing whitespace and newlines are preserved. The `-d ''` option with `read` captures everything until a null character is encountered, which is added by `printf '\\0'`.\n\n2. **Convert Newlines to `\\n`:**\n\n   If you want to replace actual newlines with the literal `\\n` character, you can use `tr` or `sed`:\n\n   ```bash\n   RESULT=$(./myscript | tr '\\n' '\\\\n')\n   ```\n\n   Or using `sed`:\n\n   ```bash\n   RESULT=$(./myscript | sed ':a;N;$!ba;s/\\n/\\\\n/g')\n   ```\n\n   In this case, `tr` or `sed` is used to replace each newline with the sequence `\\n`.\n\n3. **Output with `echo -e`:**\n\n   If you used the second method and replaced newlines with `\\n`, you can display them with `echo -e`:\n\n   ```bash\n   echo -e \"$RESULT\"\n   ```\n\nChoose the method that best suits your needs depending on whether you want to keep the output with actual newlines or convert them to `\\n` for formatted output later."
