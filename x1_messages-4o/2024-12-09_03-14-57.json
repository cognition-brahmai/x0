However, when I try to call a method from the base class, the method of the derived class is invoked instead. How can I call a method from the base class? Here's the code I'm working with:\n\n```python\nclass A(object):\n    def print_it(self):\n        print 'A'\n\nclass B(A):\n    def print_it(self):\n        print 'B'\n\nx = B()\nx.print_it()  # Outputs 'B'\nx.A  # What should I do here?\n```"

        "content": "In Python, if you want to explicitly call a method from a base class when you have overridden it in a derived class, you can do so by directly calling the method from the base class using the class name. Here's how you can modify your code to call the `print_it` method from class `A`:\n\n```python\nclass A(object):\n    def print_it(self):\n        print('A')\n\nclass B(A):\n    def print_it(self):\n        print('B')\n\nx = B()\nx.print_it()  # Outputs 'B'\n\n# Call the base class method explicitly\nA.print_it(x)  # Outputs 'A'\n```\n\nIn this example, `A.print_it(x)` is calling the `print_it` method from class `A` and passing the instance `x` explicitly as the `self` argument. This allows you to bypass the overridden method in class `B` and call the method from the base class `A` directly."
