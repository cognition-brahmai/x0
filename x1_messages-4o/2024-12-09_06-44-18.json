For example, given the string \"redirectDetail('27184','2 -New-York-Explorer-Pass')\", I am interested in obtaining '27184' only. I first tried to extract all the numbers from the string using the command `re.findall('\\d+', headline)`, but it returned both '27184' and '2'. I then tried to modify my code to `re.findall('/^[^\\d]*(\\d+)/', headline)`, expecting it to return just the first number, but instead, it returned an empty list. How can I modify my code to only return the first number from a string?"

        "content": "To extract only the first number from a string in Python using regular expressions, you can use the `re.search` function instead of `re.findall`. The `re.search` function will stop after finding the first match, which is what you're looking for.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nheadline = \"redirectDetail('27184','2 -New-York-Explorer-Pass')\"\nmatch = re.search(r'\\d+', headline)\n\nif match:\n    first_number = match.group()\n    print(first_number)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `re.search(r'\\d+', headline)` searches for the first occurrence of one or more digits (`\\d+`) in the string `headline`.\n- `match.group()` retrieves the matched text, which in this case will be the first number found in the string.\n\nBy using this approach, you should be able to extract '27184' from the given string."
