        "content": "To solve the equation \\(2(x + 3) - 4 = 10x + 2\\), let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Distribute the 2 on the left side:\n   \\[\n   2(x + 3) - 4 = 2x + 6 - 4\n   \\]\n\n2. Simplify the left side:\n   \\[\n   2x + 6 - 4 = 2x + 2\n   \\]\n\n3. The equation now is:\n   \\[\n   2x + 2 = 10x + 2\n   \\]\n\n4. Subtract \\(2x\\) from both sides to isolate the terms with \\(x\\) on one side:\n   \\[\n   2 = 8x + 2\n   \\]\n\n5. Subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the terms with \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   0 = 8x\n   \\]\n\n6. Divide both sides by 8:\n   \\[\n   x = 0\n   \\]\n\nSo, the solution to the equation is \\(x = 0\\)."
