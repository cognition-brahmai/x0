Unlike the sample graphs in the documentation, my graphs do not have the darker outlines on the individual bins. Even when I try with Matplotlib's `hist()` charts, I get the same results. I found and tried the 'edgecolor' parameter on the `plt.hist()` function which works, but I haven't found a similar parameter for the seaborn `distplot()` function. I also tried changing the `rcParams` in Matplotlib, and even reinstalling Matplotlib using Conda, but none of these attempts have been successful. How can I change the default edge color for these charts?"

        "content": "To add darker outlines to the individual bins in Seaborn's `distplot()` or Matplotlib's `hist()`, you can use a combination of parameters and customization. Although `distplot()` is deprecated and replaced by `histplot()` and `kdeplot()`, I'll provide examples for both `distplot()` and the newer `histplot()`.\n\n### Using Seaborn's `distplot()`\n\nAlthough `distplot()` is deprecated, if you still want to use it, you can customize the plots as follows:\n\n```python\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Sample data\ndata = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]\n\n# Create distplot with custom edge color\nsns.distplot(data, hist_kws={'edgecolor':'black'}, kde=False)\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Using Seaborn's `histplot()`\n\nFor a more modern approach, use `histplot()`:\n\n```python\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Sample data\ndata = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]\n\n# Create histplot with custom edge color\nsns.histplot(data, edgecolor='black')\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Using Matplotlib's `hist()`\n\nYou've mentioned using `edgecolor`, which is indeed the right approach for Matplotlib's `hist()`:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Sample data\ndata = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]\n\n# Create histogram with custom edge color\nplt.hist(data, edgecolor='black')\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- Ensure you're using the latest version of Seaborn and Matplotlib to take advantage of the latest features and bug fixes.\n- If you're customizing plots often, consider setting global styles using `sns.set_style()` or adjusting `rcParams` for a unified look across all your plots.\n- If you're encountering issues with the plots not displaying as expected, try restarting your Jupyter notebook kernel or PyCharm environment to clear any residual state.\n\nBy using these methods, you should be able to achieve the outlined bins on your histograms."
