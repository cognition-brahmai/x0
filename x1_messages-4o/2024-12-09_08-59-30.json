        "content": "Certainly! Here's a simple algorithm to generate all permutations of a given list using Python. This can be done using a recursive approach:\n\n```python\ndef generate_permutations(lst):\n    # Base case: if the list is empty or has one element, return it as the only permutation\n    if len(lst) <= 1:\n        return [lst]\n\n    # List to store all permutations\n    permutations = []\n\n    # Iterate over the list\n    for i in range(len(lst)):\n        # Extract the current element\n        current = lst[i]\n        \n        # Generate permutations for the remaining list\n        remaining_list = lst[:i] + lst[i+1:]\n        remaining_permutations = generate_permutations(remaining_list)\n\n        # Append the current element to each permutation of the remaining list\n        for perm in remaining_permutations:\n            permutations.append([current] + perm)\n\n    return permutations\n\n# Example usage\ninput_list = [1, 2, 3]\nperms = generate_permutations(input_list)\nfor perm in perms:\n    print(perm)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `generate_permutations` that recursively generates all permutations of a given list. It iterates over each element, removes it from the list, generates permutations for the remaining elements, and then appends the removed element to each of these permutations. The base case handles lists of zero or one element, which naturally have only one permutation (themselves)."
