This sport is popular in desert regions and coastal areas with large dunes. It offers a thrilling experience as you navigate the shifting sands, and it's a great way to enjoy the outdoors and explore beautiful, often remote, landscapes. If you're looking for an adventurous and novel activity, sandboarding could be a fantastic option to try out."
