The passive voice for this sentence would be \"The mouse was eaten by the cat.\" Here's how you could implement that in Go:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\ntype sentence struct {\n    subject string\n    verb    string\n    object  string\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    s := sentence{\"the mouse\", \"was eaten by\", \"the cat\"}\n    fmt.Printf(\"%s %s %s.\\n\", s.subject, s.verb, s.object)\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, the `sentence` struct is initialized with the rearranged components to reflect the passive voice. The `fmt.Printf` function is used to format and print the sentence correctly."
