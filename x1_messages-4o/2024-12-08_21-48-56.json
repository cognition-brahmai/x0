        "content": "Three species of marine animals that inhabit the intertidal zone and have mutualistic relationships with photosynthetic dinoflagellates are:\n\n1. **Giant Clam (Tridacna crocea)**: These clams host photosynthetic dinoflagellates, known as zooxanthellae, within their tissues. The dinoflagellates provide the clams with nutrients through photosynthesis.\n\n2. **Coral (Acropora millepora)**: Corals have a mutualistic relationship with zooxanthellae, which live within their tissues. The dinoflagellates perform photosynthesis and supply the coral with organic compounds, which are crucial for their growth and survival.\n\n3. **Upside-Down Jellyfish (Cassiopea andromeda)**: These jellyfish have a symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic dinoflagellates, which reside in their tentacles. The dinoflagellates provide the jellyfish with energy through photosynthesis, while the jellyfish offers them protection and a habitat."
