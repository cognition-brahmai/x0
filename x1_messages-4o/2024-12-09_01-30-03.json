        "content": "The `UnicodeDecodeError` you're encountering often occurs when the file you're trying to read contains characters that are not encoded in UTF-8. In such cases, you can try specifying a different encoding when reading the CSV file.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Specify a different encoding**: You can try using a different encoding, such as `latin1`, `iso-8859-1`, or `cp1252`, which are commonly used encodings. Try the following code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Try reading with a different encoding\ndf1 = pd.read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tuyenhavan/Statistics/Dataset/World_Life_Expectancy.csv\", \n                  sep=\";\", \n                  encoding='latin1')  # or encoding='iso-8859-1', or encoding='cp1252'\ndf1.head()\n```\n\n2. **Detect the encoding**: If you're not sure which encoding to use, you can use the `chardet` library to detect the encoding of the file. First, you need to install the library:\n\n```bash\npip install chardet\n```\n\nThen, use it to detect the encoding:\n\n```python\nimport chardet\nimport requests\n\n# Fetch the content of the file\nresponse = requests.get(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tuyenhavan/Statistics/Dataset/World_Life_Expectancy.csv\")\nrawdata = response.content\n\n# Detect the encoding\nresult = chardet.detect(rawdata)\nencoding = result['encoding']\nprint(f\"Detected encoding: {encoding}\")\n\n# Read the file with the detected encoding\ndf1 = pd.read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tuyenhavan/Statistics/Dataset/World_Life_Expectancy.csv\", \n                  sep=\";\", \n                  encoding=encoding)\ndf1.head()\n```\n\nThese steps should help you resolve the `UnicodeDecodeError`. If the error persists, there might be other issues with the CSV file itself, and you may need to inspect the file contents directly."
