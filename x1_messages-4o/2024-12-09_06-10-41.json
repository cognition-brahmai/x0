        "content": "The error you're encountering usually arises due to a misconfiguration in the `credentials.json` file. Specifically, this error message suggests that the client secret file you are using is not configured for a web or installed application. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check your `credentials.json` file:**\n   - Ensure that your `credentials.json` file is configured for either a web application or an installed application. It should contain fields like `\"installed\"` or `\"web\"`. If it does not, you may need to regenerate it in the Google Cloud Console.\n\n2. **Generate the correct OAuth credentials:**\n   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).\n   - Navigate to the API & Services section and select \"Credentials\".\n   - Click on \"Create credentials\" and select \"OAuth client ID\".\n   - For the application type, choose either \"Web application\" or \"Desktop app\" (installed application).\n   - Follow the prompts to configure the consent screen and any necessary settings.\n   - Download the newly created JSON file and replace your existing `credentials.json` with this one.\n\n3. **Verify the scopes:**\n   - Ensure that the `SCOPES` variable in your code contains the appropriate scopes required by your application. The scopes must match those allowed by your API credentials.\n\n4. **Check the Python environment:**\n   - Ensure you are using a compatible Python version and that all necessary packages are installed. It appears from the error that you might be using Python 2.7. Consider upgrading to Python 3.x if possible, as Python 2.7 is no longer supported.\n\n5. **Delete any existing `token.pickle`:**\n   - If there's an existing `token.pickle` file that might be corrupted, delete it and rerun your script to regenerate it.\n\n6. **Run the script with elevated permissions:**\n   - If the script does not have permission to write to the directory, it might not be able to create the `token.pickle`. Ensure your script has the necessary permissions to write files.\n\nAfter addressing these issues, try running your script again. This should resolve the error, allowing you to authenticate and proceed with the application."
