This is not ideal when I'm running a process that takes a long time to finish. Is there a way for my program to print the process output line by line, by polling the process output before it finishes in a loop or similar?"

        "content": "Yes, you can modify your `execute` function to read the process output line by line in real-time. You can achieve this by iterating over the output as it's being produced, which will allow you to print each line as soon as it's available. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\nclass ProcessException(Exception):\n    def __init__(self, command, exitCode, output):\n        self.command = command\n        self.exitCode = exitCode\n        self.output = output\n        super().__init__(f\"Command '{command}' failed with exit code {exitCode}\")\n\ndef execute(command):\n    process = subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, text=True)\n    \n    output = []\n    # Read line by line\n    for line in iter(process.stdout.readline, ''):\n        print(line, end='')  # Print the line as it comes\n        output.append(line)\n\n    process.stdout.close()\n    process.wait()\n    exitCode = process.returncode\n\n    if exitCode == 0:\n        return ''.join(output)\n    else:\n        raise ProcessException(command, exitCode, output)\n\n# Example usage\ntry:\n    execute(\"mvn clean install\")\nexcept ProcessException as e:\n    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n\n1. **Text Mode**: The `text=True` parameter makes `Popen` handle the output as text (strings) instead of bytes. This simplifies reading and printing.\n\n2. **Iterating over `stdout`**: By iterating over `process.stdout.readline`, you can process each line as it's outputted by the subprocess. The `iter` function with `process.stdout.readline` and an empty string as the sentinel value effectively reads until EOF.\n\n3. **Output Collection**: The output is appended to a list which is then joined to form a single string if needed.\n\n4. **Wait for Process to Finish**: After reading all the lines, `process.wait()` ensures that the process has finished before checking the exit code.\n\nThis approach allows you to see the output in real-time as each line is produced, making it more suitable for long-running processes."
