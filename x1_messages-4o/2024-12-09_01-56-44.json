For example, if I have two lists, List1=[3,5,6] and List2=[3,7,2], I want the function to return a new list, List3=[0,-2,4], where each element in List3 is the result of subtracting the corresponding element in List2 from the corresponding element in List1. I understand that I could use the zip function to pair the elements from the two lists, like this: ([(3,3), (5,7), (6,2)]), but I'm unsure of how to proceed from here."

        "content": "To create a function in Python that subtracts the elements of two lists, you can indeed use the `zip` function to pair corresponding elements from the two lists. After pairing the elements, you can iterate over these pairs and perform the subtraction for each pair. Here's a step-by-step guide and a sample function to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef subtract_lists(list1, list2):\n    # Ensure both lists have the same length\n    if len(list1) != len(list2):\n        raise ValueError(\"Both lists must have the same length.\")\n    \n    # Use zip to pair elements from both lists and subtract them\n    result = [a - b for a, b in zip(list1, list2)]\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nList1 = [3, 5, 6]\nList2 = [3, 7, 2]\nList3 = subtract_lists(List1, List2)\nprint(List3)  # Output: [0, -2, 4]\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `subtract_lists` takes two parameters, `list1` and `list2`.\n\n2. **Length Check**: Before proceeding with the subtraction, it checks if both lists have the same length. If they don't, a `ValueError` is raised to avoid any index out of range errors.\n\n3. **Subtraction using List Comprehension**: The function uses a list comprehension combined with `zip(list1, list2)` to iterate over pairs of elements from the two lists. For each pair, it subtracts the second element from the first (`a - b`) and collects the results in a new list.\n\n4. **Return the Result**: Finally, it returns the resulting list.\n\nThis function will work correctly as long as the input lists have the same length. If they do not, it will alert you with an error message."
