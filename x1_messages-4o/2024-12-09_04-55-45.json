When I run the command 'conda env create -f python3.6-environment-windows.yml', I encounter a RemoveError that says 'requests' and 'setuptools' are dependencies of conda and cannot be removed from conda's operating environment. How can I resolve this error and successfully install the library? I am following the installation instructions provided here - https://enigma.co/catalyst/install.html#installing-with-conda."

        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that the environment creation process is attempting to remove packages (`requests` and `setuptools`) that are essential for Conda's operation. This can sometimes happen if there are conflicts between the packages specified in your environment YAML file and the current base environment. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check the YAML File**: Ensure that the `python3.6-environment-windows.yml` file accurately represents the environment you want to create. Look for any unnecessary specifications that might be causing conflicts.\n\n2. **Create a New Environment**: Instead of using `conda env create`, you can try creating a new environment manually and then install the required packages. Here\u2019s how:\n   ```bash\n   conda create -n myenv python=3.6\n   conda activate myenv\n   ```\n   Then, try installing the packages specified in the YAML file one by one or in groups, ensuring each installation succeeds before proceeding to the next.\n\n3. **Modify the YAML File**: If you suspect specific packages are causing conflicts, consider modifying the YAML file to remove or adjust those packages. You can also try specifying package versions more explicitly to avoid conflicts.\n\n4. **Use `conda` with `--force`**: If you\u2019re confident about the changes you\u2019re making, you can use the `--force` option with caution:\n   ```bash\n   conda env create -f python3.6-environment-windows.yml --force\n   ```\n   However, this is generally not recommended as it can lead to unstable environments.\n\n5. **Consider Using `pip` for Some Packages**: If certain packages are not critical to be installed via Conda, you can install them using `pip` after setting up the Conda environment. This can sometimes resolve dependency issues.\n\n6. **Update Conda**: Ensure you\u2019re using the latest version of Conda, as updates often fix known bugs and improve compatibility:\n   ```bash\n   conda update conda\n   ```\n\n7. **Consult Documentation or Forums**: If the issue persists, consider checking forums or the project's GitHub issues page to see if others have encountered a similar problem.\n\nBy carefully managing package installations and resolving conflicts, you should be able to create the environment successfully. If you have specific error messages or logs, reviewing those can also provide more context on what's causing the problem."
