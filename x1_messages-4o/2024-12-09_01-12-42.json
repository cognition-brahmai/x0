I'm using the CookieStorage storage method and currently, when I try to print the messages from the response context, I get the CookieStorage object. How can I get a useful message from this or is there a better way to approach this problem?\n\nHere's my current approach:\n\n    response = self.client.post('/do-something/', follow=True)\n    self.assertEquals(response.context['messages'][0], \"fail.\")\n\nBut all I get back when I try to print the messages is:\n\n    print response.context['messages']\n    <django.contrib.messages.storage.cookie.CookieStorage object at 0x3c55250>"

        "content": "When you're using Django's messages framework with `CookieStorage`, the messages are not stored in the response context directly, which is why you're seeing the `CookieStorage` object instead of the actual message content. To access the messages, you need to iterate over the message objects in `response.context['messages']`. However, `response.context` might not always be available, especially if the view you're testing does not render a template.\n\nHere's a better way to access the messages for your unit test:\n\n1. **Ensure your view is using the messages framework correctly.** The messages should be added using `messages.add_message`, `messages.info`, `messages.success`, etc.\n\n2. **Access messages through the response's context.** Use a loop to extract the message strings.\n\nHere is how you can modify your test to extract the messages and make assertions:\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.urls import reverse\nfrom django.contrib.messages import get_messages\n\nclass YourTestCase(TestCase):\n    def test_action_and_messages(self):\n        # Perform the action\n        response = self.client.post(reverse('your-view-name'), follow=True)\n        \n        # Retrieve the messages from the response\n        messages = list(get_messages(response.wsgi_request))\n        \n        # Check that there is at least one message\n        self.assertGreater(len(messages), 0)\n        \n        # Check the content of the first message\n        self.assertEqual(str(messages[0]), \"fail.\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **`get_messages(response.wsgi_request)`**: This function allows you to retrieve the messages stored in the request object, which is more reliable than accessing them through the context.\n- **`reverse('your-view-name')`**: Use `reverse` with the view name to get the URL. Replace `'your-view-name'` with the actual name of your view.\n- **`follow=True`**: This ensures that any redirects are followed, which is often necessary to view the final page where messages appear.\n\nBy using `get_messages`, you can reliably access the messages for assertions in your tests, regardless of the message storage backend being used."
