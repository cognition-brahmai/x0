        "content": "When using `raw_id_fields` in Django's admin, the default behavior is to display the ID of the related field, which can indeed be not very user-friendly. To display a more meaningful representation, you can use the `autocomplete_fields` feature, which was introduced in Django 2.0. This allows you to search and select related objects using a more intuitive interface.\n\nHere's how you can modify your `admin.py` to use `autocomplete_fields` instead of `raw_id_fields`:\n\n1. **Update Admin Class:**\n\n   Replace `raw_id_fields` with `autocomplete_fields`:\n\n   ```python\n   class StructureAdmin(tree_editor.TreeEditor):\n       search_fields = ('name',)\n       autocomplete_fields = ('parent',)\n   ```\n\n2. **Register Admin Class:**\n\n   Ensure that your `StructureAdmin` class is registered with the admin site:\n\n   ```python\n   from django.contrib import admin\n   from .models import Structure\n\n   admin.site.register(Structure, StructureAdmin)\n   ```\n\n3. **Enable Autocomplete View:**\n\n   Make sure that the related model's admin has an autocomplete view enabled. You might need to adjust the `StructureAdmin` class or the admin class of the related model to ensure this. Django automatically handles this if `autocomplete_fields` is set.\n\n4. **Adjust Permissions:**\n\n   Ensure that the user has the necessary permissions to access the autocomplete view. Django\u2019s autocomplete feature requires AJAX requests to be authorized, so make sure users have view permissions for the related model.\n\nBy using `autocomplete_fields`, you'll provide a more user-friendly interface where users can type to search and select related objects based on the `__str__` or `__unicode__` representation of the model, which in your case, is the `name` field of the `Structure` model. This greatly enhances the usability of your Django admin panel when dealing with models with a large number of entries."
