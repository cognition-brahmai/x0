        "content": "Let's analyze the sequence you've provided: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15.\n\nAt first glance, it seems like the numbers are increasing by 3 each time. However, since you've mentioned that the next number is not simply adding 3 to the previous number, there must be another pattern or rule at play here.\n\nGiven the hint, let's think about other possibilities. One potential approach might involve an alternating or hidden pattern or applying a transformation to the sequence.\n\nOne potential pattern could be related to multiplication or another arithmetic operation. However, without additional context or a more specific hint, it's challenging to identify what the specific transformation might be.\n\nIf we hypothesize that there's a transformation applied after the addition, we might consider operations such as multiplication or introducing a new factor, but again, this would require additional information.\n\nGiven the limited information and the complexity of the puzzle, I'd suggest considering if there might be another element or rule involved, such as a different mathematical operation applied at each step or an external sequence influencing the result.\n\nIf you have any additional hints or context, please feel free to share it, and I'll be happy to help further!"
