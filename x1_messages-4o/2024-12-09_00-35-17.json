        "content": "Embedding a Python library like `Requests` directly within your own Python package is technically feasible, but it's generally not recommended due to potential licensing issues, increased complexity, and the difficulty of managing dependencies. However, if you still want to proceed, here\u2019s a basic outline of how you might achieve this:\n\n1. **Vendorizing the Library**: You can include the source code of the library within your package. This is often referred to as \"vendorizing\" a library. You would copy the library\u2019s source code into a directory within your package.\n\n   - Create a directory within your package, for example, `my_package/vendor/requests`.\n   - Copy the source files of the Requests library into this directory.\n\n2. **Modifying Imports**: You may need to modify the imports in the Requests library code to ensure they are relative to your package\u2019s structure. For example, change:\n\n   ```python\n   import requests\n   ```\n\n   to:\n\n   ```python\n   from .vendor import requests\n   ```\n\n3. **Python Path Considerations**: Ensure that your package is structured in a way that Python\u2019s import system can find the `vendor` directory when your package is installed or run.\n\n4. **Updating Your Package's Imports**: In your package, you should import the vendorized Requests library using relative imports:\n\n   ```python\n   from .vendor import requests\n   ```\n\n5. **Handling Dependencies**: If the Requests library has its own dependencies, you would need to vendorize those as well, which can quickly become complex.\n\n6. **Legal Considerations**: Ensure that you comply with the licensing terms of the Requests library. Requests is licensed under the Apache License 2.0, which generally allows redistribution and modification, but you must include a copy of the license and make note of any modifications you\u2019ve made.\n\n7. **Alternative Approach**: Consider using a virtual environment or a tool like `pipenv` or `poetry` to manage dependencies for different environments. This approach is more standard and avoids potential issues with embedding libraries directly.\n\n8. **Packaging**: If you distribute your package, use tools like `setuptools` to define dependencies in a `setup.py` file or a `requirements.txt` file so that they are automatically installed when your package is installed.\n\nBy following these steps, you can embed the Requests library into your package, but be aware of the maintenance burden and potential issues that might arise with this approach."
