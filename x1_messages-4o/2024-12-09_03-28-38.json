        "content": "In Python, you can read from standard input (stdin) using a few different approaches depending on your requirements. Here are some common methods:\n\n1. **Using `input()` function:**\n   - This is the simplest way to read a single line of input.\n   ```python\n   user_input = input()\n   ```\n\n2. **Using `sys.stdin`:**\n   - This allows more control and can be useful if you need to process multiple lines or larger input.\n   ```python\n   import sys\n\n   for line in sys.stdin:\n       # process each line\n       print(line.strip())\n   ```\n\n3. **Using `sys.stdin.read()`:**\n   - This reads all input at once and is useful if you need to read everything in one go.\n   ```python\n   import sys\n\n   data = sys.stdin.read()\n   # process data\n   print(data)\n   ```\n\n4. **Using `fileinput.input()`:**\n   - This is useful for reading from stdin or from a list of files specified on the command line.\n   ```python\n   import fileinput\n\n   for line in fileinput.input():\n       # process each line\n       print(line.strip())\n   ```\n\nFor code golf challenges, you often want to minimize the number of characters in your solution, so choose the method that allows you to achieve this while still meeting the challenge requirements. Using `input()` is typically the shortest, but `sys.stdin.read()` can be more efficient if you're dealing with multiple lines and need to work with all input at once."
