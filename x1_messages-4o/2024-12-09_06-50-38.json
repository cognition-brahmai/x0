I'm new to Python and learning how for-loops work in this language. Here's what I've attempted so far:\n\n```python\ndef altElement(a):\n    b = []\n    for i in a:\n        b.append(a)\n\n    print b\n```\n\nI'm unsure how to proceed after this."

        "content": "You're on the right track by using a loop to iterate over the elements of the list. However, to achieve your goal of returning a list containing every other element, starting with the first element, you'll need to use the `range` function with a step value. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef altElement(a):\n    b = []\n    for i in range(0, len(a), 2):  # Start at 0, go to the length of the list, step by 2\n        b.append(a[i])  # Append the element at the current index\n    return b  # Return the new list\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\nprint(altElement(my_list))  # Output: [1, 3, 5, 7]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Range with a Step**: The `range` function in Python can take a third argument, which is the step. In `range(0, len(a), 2)`, we start at index `0`, go up to `len(a)`, and step by `2`. This means we will select every other index starting from `0`.\n\n2. **Appending Elements**: Use `b.append(a[i])` to add the element at the current index `i` to the list `b`.\n\n3. **Returning the List**: Instead of printing the list, you return it so that it can be used elsewhere in your program.\n\nThis code will provide you with a list of every other element from the original list, starting with the first element."
