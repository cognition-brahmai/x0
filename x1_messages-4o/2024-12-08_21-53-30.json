        "content": "To accomplish the task of deleting all files in a directory except those with a specific extension using a shell command, you can use the `find` command combined with `rm`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```bash\nfind /path/to/files/ -type f ! -name \"*.txt\" -exec rm -f {} +\n```\n\nLet's break down the command:\n\n- `find /path/to/files/`: This part of the command specifies the directory in which you want to search for the files.\n- `-type f`: This ensures that the command only considers files and not directories.\n- `! -name \"*.txt\"`: The `!` is a negation operator, meaning \"not.\" This part of the command tells `find` to exclude files with the `.txt` extension.\n- `-exec rm -f {} +`: This part of the command executes the `rm -f` command on the files that match the criteria. The `{}` is a placeholder for the file names found, and the `+` at the end allows `find` to pass multiple files to `rm` at once for efficiency.\n\nMake sure to replace `/path/to/files/` with the actual path to your directory. Always be cautious when using `rm` to avoid accidentally deleting important files. It might be a good idea to test the `find` command without the `-exec rm -f {} +` part first to ensure it lists the files you intend to delete."
