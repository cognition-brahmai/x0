When trying to create a json file with this code: \n\n```python\njson.dumps({\"fields\": { \"name\": \"%s\", \"city\": \"%s\", \"status\": \"%s\", \"country\": \"%s\" }})\n```\n\nThe output json file has the fields in incorrect order:\n\n```python\n{\"fields\": {\"status\": \"%s\", \"city\": \"%s\", \"name\": \"%s\", \"country\": \"%s\"}}\n```\n\nHence, the substitutions for the '%s' strings are not aligned correctly. Is there a way I can force the 'dumps' function to maintain the order in which the fields were originally given?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is related to how dictionaries work in Python. Up until Python 3.6, dictionaries did not maintain order. However, starting with Python 3.7, dictionaries maintain insertion order as a language feature. If you are using Python 3.7 or later, the `json.dumps` function should preserve the order of keys as you defined them.\n\nIn your case, the issue might not be with `json.dumps` itself but rather with how you are substituting the `%s` placeholders. The order of substitution depends on how you are formatting the string after creating the JSON object.\n\nHowever, if you want to ensure the order specifically for JSON serialization, you can use `collections.OrderedDict` to define your dictionary. Here's how you can modify your code to use `OrderedDict` to ensure the order:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\nimport json\n\ndata = OrderedDict([\n    (\"fields\", OrderedDict([\n        (\"name\", \"%s\"),\n        (\"city\", \"%s\"),\n        (\"status\", \"%s\"),\n        (\"country\", \"%s\")\n    ]))\n])\n\njson_string = json.dumps(data)\nprint(json_string)\n```\n\nUsing `OrderedDict` ensures that the order of keys will be preserved when the JSON is serialized, regardless of the Python version you are using. If the order of substitution is still incorrect, ensure that you substitute the values in the same order as your keys."
