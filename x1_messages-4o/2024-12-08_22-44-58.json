        "content": "The problem you're trying to solve involves generating an array of even prime numbers using the digits 2, 4, 6, and 8, with each digit being used only once per number. However, there is an inherent issue in the task description: the only even prime number is 2. Any other even number is not prime because it will be divisible by 2.\n\nThe code you provided attempts to find even prime numbers by using permutations of the digits 2, 4, 6, and 8, but as mentioned, only the number 2 is an even prime number. Therefore, the task as described is not possible for more than one number.\n\nTo clarify:\n\n1. **Prime Numbers**: A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. The only even prime number is 2.\n\n2. **Digits Restriction**: Using only the digits 2, 4, 6, and 8, and each digit only once per number, doesn't allow for the creation of any other prime numbers if they must also be even.\n\nGiven these facts, the task is not feasible as described, and the code is trying to perform an impossible task based on the constraints provided. If there are any other details or constraints you want to explore or modify, feel free to ask!"
