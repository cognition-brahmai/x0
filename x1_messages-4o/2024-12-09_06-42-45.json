The error appears when I try to import MySQLdb in python. I'm aiming for 64 bit architecture and have checked the python and mysql versions, both of which are 64-bit. I've also attempted to delete the build directory and cleaned python setup.py. I've renamed Python/2.5/site-packages so it couldn't pick that up. In addition, I wiped everything and followed the instructions on a Stack Overflow post on installing using macports. Despite this, I still get the same error. What could be causing this issue and how can I resolve it?"

        "content": "When dealing with a 'wrong architecture' error in Python MySQL, especially when you're sure that both your Python and MySQL installations are 64-bit, there are a few areas to investigate and potential solutions to try:\n\n1. **Check Environment Variables**:\n   - Ensure that your `PATH` and `PYTHONPATH` environment variables are correctly set to the 64-bit versions of Python and MySQL. Sometimes, older or conflicting paths might be causing the issue.\n\n2. **MySQL Client Library**:\n   - Ensure that the MySQL client library you're linking against is also 64-bit. This could be a common mismatch if you have multiple versions installed.\n\n3. **Reinstall MySQLdb**:\n   - If you're using `MySQLdb`, it's important to ensure that it's compiled with the correct architecture. You might want to consider using `mysqlclient`, a fork of `MySQLdb` that is often easier to install:\n     ```bash\n     pip install mysqlclient\n     ```\n\n4. **Use Virtual Environments**:\n   - Create a virtual environment to isolate your Python installation and dependencies:\n     ```bash\n     python -m venv myenv\n     source myenv/bin/activate\n     pip install mysqlclient\n     ```\n\n5. **macOS Specific**:\n   - If you're on macOS, sometimes the system libraries can cause issues. Ensure that the macOS command line tools are up-to-date:\n     ```bash\n     xcode-select --install\n     ```\n\n6. **Homebrew or MacPorts**:\n   - If you're using MacPorts, try switching to Homebrew for installing MySQL and related tools as it might resolve any conflicts:\n     ```bash\n     brew install mysql\n     brew install openssl\n     ```\n\n7. **Check for Duplicate Libraries**:\n   - Look for any duplicate libraries that might be causing conflicts. You can do this by searching your filesystem for multiple versions of the same library.\n\n8. **Compile from Source**:\n   - If all else fails, you can try compiling `mysqlclient` or `MySQLdb` from source, ensuring that it's targeting the right architecture.\n\n9. **Debugging**:\n   - Use tools like `otool` on macOS to check the architecture of the installed libraries or binaries. This can help confirm if there are any mismatches.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, consider providing more context or specific error messages for further diagnosis."
