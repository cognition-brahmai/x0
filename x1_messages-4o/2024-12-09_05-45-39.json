I've been tasked with retrieving the last login datetime for each user. However, I've noticed that the 'last_login' field is not being updated whenever I call the authentication REST endpoint. Is this a known issue, or is there something I'm missing that needs to be done in order to update this field each time token authentication is called?"

        "content": "When using Django's built-in authentication system, the `last_login` field is typically updated automatically when a user logs in through Django's authentication views. However, when using token-based authentication with Django Rest Framework (DRF), this automatic update does not occur because the authentication mechanism bypasses the standard login process that updates the `last_login` field.\n\nTo update the `last_login` field each time a token is used for authentication, you will need to implement a custom solution. Here's a general approach you can take:\n\n1. **Custom Authentication Class**:\n   Create a custom authentication class that extends `TokenAuthentication`. Override the `authenticate` method to update the `last_login` field of the user.\n\n   ```python\n   from django.utils.timezone import now\n   from rest_framework.authentication import TokenAuthentication\n\n   class CustomTokenAuthentication(TokenAuthentication):\n       def authenticate(self, request):\n           result = super(CustomTokenAuthentication, self).authenticate(request)\n           if result is not None:\n               user, token = result\n               user.last_login = now()\n               user.save(update_fields=['last_login'])\n           return result\n   ```\n\n2. **Set Custom Authentication Class**:\n   Use this custom authentication class in your DRF settings or for specific views.\n\n   In your `settings.py`, you can set it globally:\n\n   ```python\n   REST_FRAMEWORK = {\n       'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (\n           'path.to.CustomTokenAuthentication',\n       ),\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Or, apply it to specific views or viewsets using the `authentication_classes` attribute:\n\n   ```python\n   from rest_framework.views import APIView\n   from path.to import CustomTokenAuthentication\n\n   class MyView(APIView):\n       authentication_classes = [CustomTokenAuthentication]\n       # Your view code here\n   ```\n\n3. **Consider Performance**:\n   Be mindful of the potential performance impact of updating the database on every request. If your application has a high volume of requests, you might want to consider whether updating the `last_login` field on every token-authenticated request is necessary.\n\nBy implementing this custom authentication class, you'll ensure that the `last_login` field is updated each time a user is authenticated using a token."
