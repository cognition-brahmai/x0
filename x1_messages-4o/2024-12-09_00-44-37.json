I've tried using the `split` method of the string without parameters, which works for most spaces, but not for the Zero Width Space. Here's my attempt:\n\n```python\n'a\\tb c\\nd'.split()\n```\n\nThis returns `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']`.\n\nBut when I attempt it with a string containing a Zero Width Space, it doesn't work as expected:\n\n```python\nu'a\\u200bc d'.split()\n```\n\nThis returns `[u'a\\u200bc', u'd']`.\n\nHow can I split the string by all whitespace characters, including the Zero Width Space?"

        "content": "To split a Python string by all space characters, including the Zero Width Space (U+200B), you can use the `re` module, which provides support for regular expressions. The `re.split()` function allows you to split a string by a pattern, which can include multiple types of whitespace characters.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Define the string containing various whitespace characters, including Zero Width Space\ntext = u'a\\u200b b\\tc\\nd'\n\n# Use a regular expression to split by any whitespace character, including the Zero Width Space\n# \\s matches any whitespace character, and \\u200b is for Zero Width Space specifically\nresult = re.split(r'[\\s\\u200b]+', text)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `[\\s\\u200b]+` is a regular expression pattern that matches one or more occurrences of any whitespace character (`\\s`) or the Zero Width Space (`\\u200b`).\n- `re.split()` uses this pattern to split the string wherever these characters appear.\n\nThis approach ensures that all whitespace, including the Zero Width Space, is considered when splitting the string."
