        "content": "Yes, you can modify the default port for TensorBoard using the `--port` option. This allows you to run multiple instances of TensorBoard on different ports. You can specify the desired port number when launching TensorBoard from the command line.\n\nFor example, to run TensorBoard on port 8008, you can use the following command:\n\n```bash\ntensorboard --logdir=your_log_directory --port=8008\n```\n\nReplace `your_log_directory` with the path to your log directory. This command will start TensorBoard on port 8008 instead of the default port 6006.\n\nYou can open additional instances of TensorBoard on different ports by specifying different port numbers:\n\n```bash\ntensorboard --logdir=another_log_directory --port=8010\n```\n\nThis flexibility allows you to monitor multiple training processes simultaneously by accessing them through different ports in your web browser."
