Additionally, you are required to find the optimal position to insert the new number such that the total number of inversions in the list is minimized. Furthermore, you need to provide a step-by-step algorithm to implement this optimization. The list in question is [1, 4, 6, 7], and the new number to be inserted is 5. Please provide the new list after the insertion, the total number of inversions in the list, and the step-by-step algorithm to implement the optimization."

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to insert the new number into the given sorted list such that the list remains sorted and the total number of inversions is minimized. An inversion is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and list[i] > list[j].\n\n### Step-by-step Algorithm:\n\n1. **Identify the Position to Insert the New Number:**\n   - Since the list is already sorted, the optimal position to insert the new number while keeping the list sorted is to find the first element in the list that is greater than the new number.\n   - This can be done using a simple linear search or a more efficient binary search, given the list is sorted.\n\n2. **Perform the Insertion:**\n   - Insert the new number at the identified position.\n\n3. **Count Inversions:**\n   - After insertion, iterate through the list and count the number of inversions. Since the list is sorted, this step is more of a validation to ensure no inversions have been introduced by the insertion.\n\n### Implementation:\n\n1. **Initialize the List and New Number:**\n   ```python\n   original_list = [1, 4, 6, 7]\n   new_number = 5\n   ```\n\n2. **Find the Position to Insert:**\n   - We use a binary search to efficiently find the correct position:\n   ```python\n   def find_insert_position(lst, number):\n       low, high = 0, len(lst)\n       while low < high:\n           mid = (low + high) // 2\n           if lst[mid] < number:\n               low = mid + 1\n           else:\n               high = mid\n       return low\n   ```\n\n3. **Insert the New Number:**\n   ```python\n   position = find_insert_position(original_list, new_number)\n   new_list = original_list[:position] + [new_number] + original_list[position:]\n   ```\n\n4. **Count Inversions:**\n   - As the list is sorted and we inserted the number in the correct position, the inversion count should still be zero.\n   ```python\n   def count_inversions(lst):\n       inversions = 0\n       for i in range(len(lst)):\n           for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):\n               if lst[i] > lst[j]:\n                   inversions += 1\n       return inversions\n\n   total_inversions = count_inversions(new_list)\n   ```\n\n### Result:\n\n- **New List:** `[1, 4, 5, 6, 7]`\n- **Total Number of Inversions:** `0`\n\nThis algorithm efficiently finds the correct position to insert the new number, ensuring the list remains sorted and the number of inversions is minimized. In this case, since the list is sorted and we inserted the number into the correct position, there are no inversions in the final list."
