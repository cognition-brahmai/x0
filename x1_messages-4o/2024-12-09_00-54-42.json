I have imported an xls file into a pandas dataframe and I want to use an explicit loop to update the rows which do not have the x-y coordinates. I have read the topic \"Why doesn't this function \"take\" after I iterrows over a pandas DataFrame?\" and I understand that the iterrow function only gives us a view rather than a copy for editing. So, how can I update the value row by row? Would the use of 'lambda' be feasible in this case? Below is my current code:\n\n```python\nfor index, row in rche_df.iterrows():\n    if isinstance(row.wgs1984_latitude, float):\n        row = row.copy()\n        target = row.address_chi        \n        dict_temp = geocoding(target)\n        row.wgs1984_latitude = dict_temp['lat']\n        row.wgs1984_longitude = dict_temp['long']\n```"

        "content": "When working with pandas DataFrames, updating rows directly using `iterrows()` can be tricky since `iterrows()` returns a Series, which is a copy of the data in the DataFrame. Therefore, changes made to the Series do not affect the original DataFrame. Instead of using `iterrows()`, you can update the DataFrame by assigning values directly using the index. Here's a revised version of your code that updates the DataFrame correctly:\n\n```python\nfor index, row in rche_df.iterrows():\n    if isinstance(row.wgs1984_latitude, float):\n        # Get the address\n        target = row.address_chi\n\n        # Perform geocoding to get coordinates\n        dict_temp = geocoding(target)\n\n        # Update the DataFrame with new coordinates\n        rche_df.at[index, 'wgs1984_latitude'] = dict_temp['lat']\n        rche_df.at[index, 'wgs1984_longitude'] = dict_temp['long']\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`rche_df.at[index, 'column_name']`**: This is used to assign new values to specific cells in the DataFrame based on the index and column name. This method directly updates the DataFrame, avoiding the issue of modifying a copy.\n  \n- **`isinstance(row.wgs1984_latitude, float)`**: This condition checks if the latitude value is of type float, which seems to be your condition to determine whether the coordinate needs updating. Adjust this condition if necessary based on your specific requirements.\n\n### Alternative with `apply` and `lambda`:\nUsing `apply` with a lambda function can be a more efficient approach when you want to transform or update entire columns based on some logic:\n\n```python\ndef update_coordinates(row):\n    if isinstance(row.wgs1984_latitude, float):\n        target = row.address_chi\n        dict_temp = geocoding(target)\n        row.wgs1984_latitude = dict_temp['lat']\n        row.wgs1984_longitude = dict_temp['long']\n    return row\n\nrche_df = rche_df.apply(update_coordinates, axis=1)\n```\n\nThis `apply` method applies the `update_coordinates` function to each row in the DataFrame, allowing you to update the values as needed. Choose the method that best fits your coding style and performance requirements."
