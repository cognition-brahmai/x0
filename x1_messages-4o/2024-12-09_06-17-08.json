Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfirst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nsecond = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n\nthird = [a + b for a, b in zip(first, second)]\n\nprint(third)\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n\n```python\n[7, 9, 11, 13, 15]\n```\n\nThe `zip()` function pairs elements from `first` and `second` together, and the list comprehension iterates over these pairs, summing each pair and forming the new list `third`."
