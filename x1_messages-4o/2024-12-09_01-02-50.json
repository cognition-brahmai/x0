        "content": "I am working with Python and I am trying to print the size of all the files in a directory (including its subdirectories). However, I am encountering a problem with the variable scope. I understand that the variable 'im' is out of scope when I try to access it in the line 'im.size'. However, I am unsure of how to fix this issue without using 'else' or 'finally' blocks. When I run my code, I get the following traceback error: \n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"batch.py\", line 13, in <module>\n    print im.size\nNameError: name 'im' is not defined\n```\n\nHere is the code that I am using:\n\n```python\nimport Image\nimport os\nfor dirname, dirs, files in os.walk(\".\"):\n    for filename in files:\n        try:\n            im = Image.open(os.path.join(dirname,filename))\n        except IOError:\n            print \"error opening file :: \"  + os.path.join(dirname,filename)\n        print im.size\n```\n\nHow can I adjust my code to fix this scope issue and successfully print the size of all files in a directory (and subdirectories)?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering arises because the variable `im` is only defined inside the `try` block. If an exception occurs, the `print im.size` line attempts to access `im` which hasn't been defined due to the exception, thus causing the `NameError`.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can move the `print im.size` line inside the `try` block. This ensures that `im.size` is only accessed if `im` was successfully defined. Here's how you can adjust your code:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport os\n\nfor dirname, dirs, files in os.walk(\".\"):\n    for filename in files:\n        try:\n            im = Image.open(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n            print(im.size)  # Moved this line inside the try block\n        except IOError:\n            print(\"error opening file :: \" + os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n```\n\nA few additional notes:\n\n1. Make sure you have the correct import statement for the `Image` module. If you're using the `Pillow` library (a fork of PIL), the import should be `from PIL import Image`.\n\n2. It's a good idea to handle file closing. You can use a `with` statement to ensure that the file is properly closed after processing:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport os\n\nfor dirname, dirs, files in os.walk(\".\"):\n    for filename in files:\n        filepath = os.path.join(dirname, filename)\n        try:\n            with Image.open(filepath) as im:\n                print(im.size)\n        except IOError:\n            print(\"error opening file :: \" + filepath)\n```\n\nUsing `with Image.open(filepath) as im:` ensures the file is properly closed after its block of code is executed."
