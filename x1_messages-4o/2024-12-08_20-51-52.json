The ratio of red to blue marbles in Jar A is 1:3 while the ratio of blue to green marbles in Jar B is 2:5. \nYou need to select one marble from each jar randomly and determine the sum of their colors as follows:\n- If both marbles are the same color, their sum is the number of marbles of that color in both jars.\n- If the marbles are different colors, their sum is the ratio of the number of marbles of the color that appears in Jar A to the number of marbles of the color that appears in Jar B.\nWhat is the sum of the colors of the two marbles you randomly select, given that you can only select one marble from each jar and the sum must be greater than zero and less than 100?"

        "content": "To solve this problem, let's first represent the number of marbles in each jar using variables:\n\nLet the number of red marbles in Jar A be \\( R \\) and the number of blue marbles in Jar A be \\( B_A \\). According to the ratio given, \\( R:B_A = 1:3 \\), so if \\( R = x \\), then \\( B_A = 3x \\).\n\nFor Jar B, let the number of blue marbles be \\( B_B \\) and the number of green marbles be \\( G \\). According to the ratio, \\( B_B:G = 2:5 \\), so if \\( B_B = 2y \\), then \\( G = 5y \\).\n\nNow, let's consider the possible outcomes when selecting one marble from each jar:\n\n1. **Both marbles are blue:**\n   - The sum is the number of blue marbles in both jars, which is \\( B_A + B_B = 3x + 2y \\).\n\n2. **One marble is red, and the other is blue:**\n   - The sum is the ratio of the number of red marbles in Jar A to the number of blue marbles in Jar B, which is \\( \\frac{R}{B_B} = \\frac{x}{2y} \\).\n\n3. **One marble is red, and the other is green:**\n   - The sum is the ratio of the number of red marbles in Jar A to the number of green marbles in Jar B, which is \\( \\frac{R}{G} = \\frac{x}{5y} \\).\n\n4. **One marble is blue, and the other is green:**\n   - The sum is the ratio of the number of blue marbles in Jar A to the number of green marbles in Jar B, which is \\( \\frac{B_A}{G} = \\frac{3x}{5y} \\).\n\nOur goal is to find sums that are greater than zero and less than 100. However, the problem doesn't provide specific values for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), making direct calculation impossible. Yet, we can explore the scenario theoretically:\n\n- To ensure the sum is greater than zero and less than 100, we need to select reasonable values for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) such that each resulting sum satisfies this condition.\n  \nGiven that the problem is more theoretical and doesn't specify \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), we assume the base constraints provided by the ratios (like \\( 1 \\leq x, y \\)). If we assume \\( x = 1 \\) and \\( y = 1 \\) for simplicity:\n\n- The sum for two blue marbles: \\( 3(1) + 2(1) = 5 \\).\n- The sum for red and blue: \\( \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \\).\n- The sum for red and green: \\( \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2 \\).\n- The sum for blue and green: \\( \\frac{3}{5} = 0.6 \\).\n\nAll these values are between 0 and 100, but only the first meets the integer constraint typically expected in such problems. Thus, if we assume integers are preferred, the only integer sum here is 5.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the colors of the two marbles you select, ensuring it is an integer and fits the constraint, is 5."
