        "content": "I am trying to understand how the `axis` parameter works in NumPy, specifically when using the `myArray.sum(axis=num)` function. I initially thought that if the array is 3-dimensional, `axis=0` would return three elements that represent the sum of all nested items at the same position. Similarly, if each dimension contained five dimensions, I thought `axis=1` would return a result of five items, and so on. However, this is not the case as I've observed in my code. Can someone explain how the `axis` parameter actually works in NumPy?\n\nHere is my code for reference:\n\n```python\n>>> e\narray([[[1, 0],\n        [0, 0]],\n\n       [[1, 1],\n        [1, 0]],\n\n       [[1, 0],\n        [0, 1]]])\n>>> e.sum(axis = 0)\narray([[3, 1],\n       [1, 1]])\n>>> e.sum(axis=1)\narray([[1, 0],\n       [2, 1],\n       [1, 1]])\n>>> e.sum(axis=2)\narray([[1, 0],\n       [2, 1],\n       [1, 1]])\n>>> \n```"

        "content": "In NumPy, the `axis` parameter specifies the dimension along which a function like `sum` should operate. To understand how it works, let's break it down using your 3-dimensional array example.\n\nYour array `e` has the shape `(3, 2, 2)`, which means it has:\n- 3 blocks (along axis 0)\n- Each block has 2 rows (along axis 1)\n- Each row has 2 columns (along axis 2)\n\nHere's how the `axis` parameter affects the `sum` function:\n\n1. **`axis=0`**: This sums across the first dimension (blocks). It collapses the first dimension, and the result has the shape `(2, 2)`. This means you're summing each corresponding position across the 3 blocks:\n   - `[[3, 1], [1, 1]]` is obtained by summing:\n     - The first column of each block: `[1+1+1, 0+1+0]` \u2192 `[3, 1]`\n     - The second column of each block: `[0+1+0, 0+0+1]` \u2192 `[1, 1]`\n\n2. **`axis=1`**: This sums across the second dimension (rows within each block). It collapses the second dimension, and the result has the shape `(3, 2)`. This means you're summing within each block:\n   - For the first block: `[[1, 0] + [0, 0]]` \u2192 `[1, 0]`\n   - For the second block: `[[1, 1] + [1, 0]]` \u2192 `[2, 1]`\n   - For the third block: `[[1, 0] + [0, 1]]` \u2192 `[1, 1]`\n\n3. **`axis=2`**: This sums across the third dimension (columns within each row). It collapses the third dimension, and the result has the shape `(3, 2)`. This means you're summing across the columns of each row:\n   - For the first block, row-wise:\n     - `[1+0]` \u2192 `[1]`\n     - `[0+0]` \u2192 `[0]`\n   - For the second block, row-wise:\n     - `[1+1]` \u2192 `[2]`\n     - `[1+0]` \u2192 `[1]`\n   - For the third block, row-wise:\n     - `[1+0]` \u2192 `[1]`\n     - `[0+1]` \u2192 `[1]`\n\nSo, when you specify an `axis`, you're telling NumPy to sum across that axis, reducing the dimensionality of the result along that axis. Each axis corresponds to a dimension of the array, starting with 0 for the first dimension."
