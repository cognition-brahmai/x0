In other words, I want my Python script to continue its execution while the external command is still running. I have attempted using `os.system()` and appending `&` at the end of the command, which seems to achieve the desired result. However, I'm unsure if this is the recommended approach. Can you advise whether using `os.system()` for this purpose is appropriate or if there is a better alternative? `commands.call()` is not suitable for my needs as it blocks on the external command."

        "content": "To execute an external command asynchronously from a Python script, using the `os.system()` function with an appended `&` is a quick solution, but it's generally not the recommended approach for robust applications. Instead, you can use the `subprocess` module, which is more powerful and flexible. The `subprocess` module provides better facilities for launching and interacting with subprocesses.\n\nHere\u2019s an approach using `subprocess.Popen`, which allows you to start a process and continue executing your Python script without waiting for the process to complete:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\n# Start the external command asynchronously\nprocess = subprocess.Popen(['your_command', 'arg1', 'arg2'])\n\n# Continue with the rest of your Python script\nprint(\"This will print immediately, while the command runs in the background.\")\n\n# Later, if needed, you can check the status of the process\n# process.poll() returns None if the process is still running\nif process.poll() is None:\n    print(\"The process is still running.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The process has completed.\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Non-blocking**: `subprocess.Popen` is non-blocking, meaning it doesn't wait for the command to finish before moving on to the next lines of your script.\n\n2. **Control and Interaction**: With `Popen`, you have more control over the input/output/error pipes of the process, which can be useful if you need to process the output of the command or pass input to it.\n\n3. **Portability**: The `subprocess` module is available on all platforms where Python runs, making your code more portable.\n\n4. **Resource Management**: Make sure to handle the cleanup properly. You might want to wait for the process to complete at some point or kill it if necessary, using methods like `process.wait()` or `process.terminate()`.\n\nUsing `subprocess.Popen` is generally considered the best practice for running external commands asynchronously in Python."
