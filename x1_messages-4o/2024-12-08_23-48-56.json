For instance, what would be the classification of a transparent solid material using this function? Here is some sample Latex code to get you started:\n\\newcommand{\\classifyItem}[1]{%\n   % Add code here to classify the material as consumable or non-consumable\n   % Return \"consumable\" or \"non-consumable\" based on the classification\n}\n% Example usage:\n\\classifyItem{transparent solid}\nThe classification of this item is \\classifyItem{transparent solid}."

        "content": "Creating a LaTeX function to classify an item as either consumable or non-consumable based on its material properties involves setting up a simple decision rule within the LaTeX command. However, it's important to note that LaTeX isn't designed for complex logic processing, but we can implement a basic example using conditionals.\n\nHere's a simple approach using the `ifthen` package, which allows for conditional logic:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{ifthen}\n\n\\newcommand{\\classifyItem}[1]{%\n    \\ifthenelse{\\equal{#1}{transparent solid}}{non-consumable}{undefined}\n}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n% Example usage:\n\\classifyItem{transparent solid}\n\nThe classification of this item is \\classifyItem{transparent solid}.\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- We use the `ifthen` package to handle conditional statements in LaTeX.\n- The `\\classifyItem` command checks if the input is \"transparent solid\". If it is, it outputs \"non-consumable\".\n- If the input is anything else, it outputs \"undefined\". You can expand this logic to include more materials and classifications.\n\nThis example assumes that \"transparent solid\" is non-consumable. You can modify the conditions and outputs to suit your classification needs. For more complex logic or a wider range of materials, you might consider using a different programming tool better suited for processing logic, such as Python, and then integrating the results into your LaTeX document."
