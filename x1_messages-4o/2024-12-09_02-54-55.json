I am able to successfully open it and read its contents, but I would like to discard the unnecessary parts and manipulate the data I need. For example, the URL I am working with is 'http://www.quandl.com/api/v1/datasets/FRED/GDP.json'. When I use the code below, it returns a string with the information. Is there a way to convert this string into a dictionary so I can iterate over it? Or do I have to parse it as a string type?\n\nHere is the code I have so far:\n\n```python\nfrom urllib.request import urlopen\n\nurl = 'http://www.quandl.com/api/v1/datasets/FRED/GDP.json'\nresponse = urlopen(url)\n\nprint(response.read()) # returns string with info\n```"

        "content": "To convert the string data you retrieve from a URL into a dictionary, you can make use of the `json` module in Python. The `json` module allows you to parse JSON strings into Python dictionaries and vice versa. Here is how you can modify your code to parse the JSON data:\n\n```python\nfrom urllib.request import urlopen\nimport json\n\nurl = 'http://www.quandl.com/api/v1/datasets/FRED/GDP.json'\nresponse = urlopen(url)\n\n# Read the response and decode it to a string\ndata = response.read().decode('utf-8')\n\n# Parse the string into a Python dictionary\njson_data = json.loads(data)\n\n# Now you can work with the data as a dictionary\nprint(json_data)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what the modified code does:\n\n1. It reads the response from the URL and decodes it from bytes to a UTF-8 string.\n2. It uses `json.loads()` to parse the JSON string into a Python dictionary.\n3. You can then access the data within the JSON object using standard dictionary operations.\n\nThis way, you can easily manipulate and iterate over the data as needed."
