In school, we had a similar project where we were provided an API to interact with the game world and we had to program the AI of a single player. I am not looking for a game engine or a framework, but a complete game that only lacks AI code and is preferably set up for this kind of exercise. Do you have any suggestions? I would prefer if the game is in Java, but I am open to any language."

        "content": "Finding a suitable open-source AI-controlled 3D game that fits your requirements can be a bit challenging, but there are several projects that might serve as good starting points for your AI programming practice:\n\n1. **jMonkeyEngine with Open-Source Projects**: While jMonkeyEngine is primarily a game engine, it has several open-source projects and demos that could be adapted for AI programming. Check out the jMonkeyEngine community and GitHub repositories for projects that might serve as a base for your AI development.\n\n2. **Minetest**: Minetest is an open-source voxel game engine, similar to Minecraft, written in C++. It has a modding API that allows for AI programming, and you might find community mods or projects that you can adapt for single-player AI exercises.\n\n3. **0 A.D.**: This is a free, open-source, historical real-time strategy game. It's primarily written in C++ and JavaScript. The game has a robust modding environment and you could potentially create or modify existing AI scripts to control single players.\n\n4. **OpenRA**: An open-source project recreating and modernizing classic real-time strategy games such as Command & Conquer. It's written in C# and allows for AI scripting, which might be useful for your exercise.\n\n5. **Unvanquished**: This is a free and open-source first-person strategy game that combines real-time strategy with first-person shooter elements. The game is scripted in C++ and supports mods, including AI scripting.\n\n6. **Battle for Wesnoth**: While not 3D, this is a well-known open-source turn-based strategy game with a robust modding and AI scripting environment, primarily using C++ and Lua.\n\nFor Java-specific options, you might need to look into game development forums and repositories to find any community-driven projects or demos that are open to modification for AI practice. Additionally, checking platforms like GitHub for Java-based open-source games might yield some interesting projects that align with your goals."
