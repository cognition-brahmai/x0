        "content": "To convert a given linear equation into its standard form \\(Ax + By = C\\) with the conditions specified, and to find the x and y intercepts, you can follow these steps in Python:\n\n1. Convert the equation to the standard form \\(Ax + By = C\\) with \\(A > 0\\) and \\(|B| > 5\\).\n2. Calculate the x and y intercepts.\n\nHere's a Python script that performs these tasks:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\ndef convert_to_standard_form(equation, x_symbol, y_symbol):\n    # Simplify the equation to the form Ax + By = C\n    simplified_eq = equation.expand()\n    x_coefficient = simplified_eq.coeff(x_symbol)\n    y_coefficient = simplified_eq.coeff(y_symbol)\n    constant_term = -simplified_eq.as_coefficients_dict().get(1, 0)\n    \n    # Ensure A > 0\n    if x_coefficient < 0:\n        x_coefficient *= -1\n        y_coefficient *= -1\n        constant_term *= -1\n    \n    # Ensure |B| > 5\n    if abs(y_coefficient) <= 5:\n        factor = 6 / abs(y_coefficient)\n        x_coefficient *= factor\n        y_coefficient *= factor\n        constant_term *= factor\n    \n    return Eq(x_coefficient * x_symbol + y_coefficient * y_symbol, constant_term)\n\ndef find_intercepts(standard_eq, x_symbol, y_symbol):\n    # For x-intercept, set y = 0\n    x_intercept_eq = standard_eq.subs(y_symbol, 0)\n    x_intercept = solve(x_intercept_eq, x_symbol)[0]\n    \n    # For y-intercept, set x = 0\n    y_intercept_eq = standard_eq.subs(x_symbol, 0)\n    y_intercept = solve(y_intercept_eq, y_symbol)[0]\n    \n    return x_intercept, y_intercept\n\n# Example usage:\nx, y = symbols('x y')\n# Example linear equation: 2x + 3y = 6 (this can be any linear equation)\nequation = Eq(2*x + 3*y, 6)\n\nstandard_eq = convert_to_standard_form(equation, x, y)\nx_intercept, y_intercept = find_intercepts(standard_eq, x, y)\n\nprint(\"Standard Form:\", standard_eq)\nprint(\"X-intercept:\", x_intercept)\nprint(\"Y-intercept:\", y_intercept)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Convert to Standard Form**: The function `convert_to_standard_form` takes the given equation and ensures that the coefficient of x (\\(A\\)) is positive. It also ensures that the absolute value of the coefficient of y (\\(|B|\\)) is greater than 5 by scaling the coefficients accordingly.\n\n2. **Find Intercepts**: The function `find_intercepts` calculates the x-intercept by setting \\(y = 0\\) and solving for \\(x\\), and the y-intercept by setting \\(x = 0\\) and solving for \\(y\\).\n\nYou can replace the example equation with any other linear equation to convert it to standard form and find its intercepts."
