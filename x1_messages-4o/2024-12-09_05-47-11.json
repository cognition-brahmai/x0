This empty string could be a unicode `u\"\"` or a non-unicode `\"\"`. What is the best way to check for this type of empty string? I have tried several methods to check for both normal and unicode empty strings, but I'm not sure if they are the best ways. Is there a better, less hard-coded method for doing this?"

        "content": "In Python 2.7, you can handle both unicode and non-unicode empty strings effectively by checking for a string's truthiness. In Python, both `\"\"` and `u\"\"` evaluate to `False` when used in a boolean context. Here's a concise and efficient way to check for both types of empty strings:\n\n```python\ndef is_empty_string(s):\n    return s == \"\" or s == u\"\"\n\n# Alternatively, using truthiness:\ndef is_empty_string(s):\n    return not s  # This will return True for both \"\" and u\"\"\n```\n\nThe second method utilizes the fact that empty strings, whether unicode or not, are considered `False` in a boolean context. This approach is more Pythonic and concise.\n\nIf you specifically want to ensure the variable is a string or unicode before checking its emptiness, you can add a type check:\n\n```python\ndef is_empty_string(s):\n    return isinstance(s, (str, unicode)) and not s\n```\n\nThis function first checks if `s` is either a `str` or `unicode` instance and then checks its truthiness. This method is robust and handles the potential cases where `s` might not be a string at all."
