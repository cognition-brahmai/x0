        "content": "To connect the client and server across different networks, you'll need to make a few changes to your code and network setup. Here are the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. **Server Code Modifications:**\n   - Ensure that the server is bound to the correct IP address. For connections from different networks, you should bind the server to its public IP address or ensure it is accessible via the public IP.\n   - Replace `host = '0.0.0.0'` with the actual IP address of the server if necessary. However, `0.0.0.0` means listening on all interfaces, which is usually correct if you want the server to be accessible from any network.\n\n2. **Client Code Modifications:**\n   - Update the `host` variable to point to the server's public IP address instead of using `socket.gethostname()`. This should be the public IP of the machine that the server is running on.\n   \n   ```python\n   host = 'SERVER_PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS'\n   ```\n\n3. **Network Configuration:**\n   - **Port Forwarding:** If the server is behind a router, make sure that the router is configured to forward the port (12345 in this case) to the server's local IP address.\n   - **Firewall Rules:** Ensure that any firewalls on the server (or its network) allow incoming connections on the specified port. You may need to add a rule to allow traffic on port 12345.\n\n4. **Testing and Debugging:**\n   - Make sure that the server is reachable from the client\u2019s network by using tools like `ping` or `telnet` to test connectivity on the specified port.\n   - Check that the server is running and listening on the correct port.\n\nHere's how your updated client code might look:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/python           # This is client.py file\n\nimport socket               # Import socket module\n\ns = socket.socket()         # Create a socket object\nhost = 'SERVER_PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS' # Replace with the server's public IP\nport = 12345                # The port number should match the server\n\nprint 'Connecting to ', host, port\ns.connect((host, port))\n\nwhile True:\n  msg = raw_input('CLIENT >> ')\n  s.send(msg)\n  msg = s.recv(1024)\n  print 'SERVER >> ', msg\n```\n\nBy following these steps, your client should be able to connect to the server across different networks. Make sure your network and firewall settings are properly configured to allow this connection."
