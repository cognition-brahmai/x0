I have the following code in place:\n\n```python\ndir = 'path_to_my_folder'\nif not os.path.exists(dir):\n    os.makedirs(dir)\n```\n\nThis code allows me to create a directory if it does not already exist. The folder is used by a program to write text files into that folder. I want to start with a brand new, empty folder every time my program runs. Is there a way to overwrite the folder and create a new one with the same name if it already exists?"

        "content": "To overwrite an existing folder and create a new one with the same name using Python, you can first remove the existing directory and then create a new one. You can achieve this using the `shutil` module to remove the directory and its contents and then use `os.makedirs` to create a new one. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport shutil\n\ndir = 'path_to_my_folder'\n\n# Check if the directory exists\nif os.path.exists(dir):\n    # Remove the directory and all its contents\n    shutil.rmtree(dir)\n\n# Create a new, empty directory\nos.makedirs(dir)\n```\n\nThis code will ensure that if the directory already exists, it is completely removed along with all its contents, and a new, empty directory with the same name is created. Be cautious with this approach, as it will delete all the data in the existing directory. Make sure this is the behavior you want before running the code."
