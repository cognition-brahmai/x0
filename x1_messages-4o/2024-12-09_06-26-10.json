The `-c` option allows you to run a Python command directly from the command line by providing the Python code as a string.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use it:\n\n```bash\npython -c \"print('Hello, World!')\"\n```\n\nThis command will output:\n\n```\nHello, World!\n```\n\nYou can also execute more complex commands, including importing modules and running multiple lines of code by separating them with semicolons:\n\n```bash\npython -c \"import math; print(math.sqrt(16))\"\n```\n\nThis command will output:\n\n```\n4.0\n```\n\nRemember to properly escape any special characters if you're running this in a shell environment that interprets them."
