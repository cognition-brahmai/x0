        "content": "How can I debug a Python segmentation fault?\n\nI am attempting to run our Python code on SuSE 12.3. However, we are encountering reproducible segmentation faults. This Python code has been functioning on other platforms without any segmentation faults for years and we only code in Python, without any C extension. The segmentation fault occurs on interpreter shutdown. I can run the script multiple times using:\n\n```\npython -m pdb myscript.py arg1 arg1\ncontinue\nrun\ncontinue\nrun\n```\n\nBut the segmentation faults occur when I leave the pdb with ctrl-d. I have tried to debug it with gdb and this is the output:\n\n```\ngdb \n> file python\n> run myscript.py arg1 arg2\nProgram received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.\n[Switching to Thread 0x7fffefbe2700 (LWP 15483)]\n0x00007ffff7aef93c in PyEval_EvalFrameEx () from /usr/lib64/libpython2.7.so.1.0\n(gdb) bt\n#0  0x00007ffff7aef93c in PyEval_EvalFrameEx () from /usr/lib64/libpython2.7.so.1.0\n#1  0x00007ffff7af5303 in PyEval_EvalCodeEx () from /usr/lib64/libpython2.7.so.1.0\n#2  0x00007ffff7adc858 in ??

I found out that the initial problem was http://bugs.python.org/issue1856 (shutdown (exit) can hang or segfault with daemon threads running), which is related to this post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18098475/detect-interpreter-shut-down-in-daemon-thread. What is the best way to debug this?"

        "content": "Debugging a segmentation fault in Python, especially on interpreter shutdown, can be challenging. Here are several strategies to help you diagnose and potentially resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Update Python and Libraries:**\n   - Ensure you are using the latest version of Python 2.7.x that is available for your platform. Some bugs related to interpreter shutdown have been fixed in later releases.\n   - Check for updates to any libraries you are using. Even if you do not use C extensions directly, some libraries may include them.\n\n2. **Check for Daemon Threads:**\n   - As you mentioned, this issue might be related to daemon threads. Ensure that all threads are properly terminated before the main program exits. This can be done by setting `daemon` to `False` and explicitly joining threads.\n\n3. **Review Code for C Extensions:**\n   - While you mentioned there are no C extensions, verify that none of the third-party libraries you use include C extensions. These can sometimes cause segmentation faults.\n\n4. **Use Valgrind:**\n   - Valgrind is a powerful tool for detecting memory management issues. Run your Python script under Valgrind to look for memory leaks or invalid memory accesses that could cause a segmentation fault.\n   ```bash\n   valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full python myscript.py arg1 arg2\n   ```\n\n5. **Simplify and Isolate the Problem:**\n   - Try to create a minimal reproducible example of the fault. This can sometimes reveal the root cause or at least make it easier to debug.\n\n6. **Recompile Python with Debug Symbols:**\n   - If you're comfortable doing so, compile Python from source with debugging symbols enabled. This will provide more informative stack traces.\n   - Use `./configure --with-pydebug` when building Python.\n\n7. **Analyze with GDB:**\n   - Use GDB to get a more detailed stack trace. Ensure you have the debugging symbols for Python and any libraries you use. This often involves installing `python2.7-dbg` or a similar package.\n   - Use the `pystack` command after loading the gdbinit file to get a Python stack trace.\n\n8. **Experiment with Python 3:**\n   - If feasible, try running your code on Python 3. The issue might not exist there, and it could be a good opportunity to start porting your code.\n\n9. **Contact Support or Community:**\n   - If you're using third-party libraries, consider reaching out to their support or community forums. They might have encountered and resolved similar issues.\n\n10. **Examine System-Specific Issues:**\n    - Sometimes, the problem might be specific to the system or its configuration. Check for any system updates or configurations that might affect Python's behavior.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to gather more information about the segmentation fault, which will help you or others to diagnose and fix the issue."
