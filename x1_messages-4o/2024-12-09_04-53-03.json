The call to this module sometimes takes several seconds and freezes my app, so I want to await its response. However, when trying to use 'await' with a call to the module, I am encountering a TypeError that says \"object dict can't be used in 'await' expression\". Here is my code:\n\n```python\nimport thirdPartyAPIwrapper\n\nasync def getData():\n    retrienveData = await thirdPartyAPIWrapper.data()\n    return await retrieveData\n\ndef main():\n    loop = asncio.get_event_loop()\n    data = loop.run_until_complete(getData())\n    loop.close\n    return data\n```\nWhy can I not use 'await' with a dictionary object? Is there a workaround for this? If asyncio with async/await doesn't work with a third party module that doesn't return a coroutine, what are the alternative options I can consider?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you are encountering is because the `await` keyword is used to wait for an asynchronous operation, typically a coroutine or an object that implements the special `__await__` method. In your case, it appears that the `thirdPartyAPIWrapper.data()` function is returning a dictionary directly, rather than a coroutine or a future that you can `await`.\n\nHere are some steps and alternatives you can consider:\n\n1. **Check the Documentation**: First, ensure that the third-party module you're using supports asynchronous operations. If it doesn't, you will need to handle the operation differently.\n\n2. **Use a Thread Pool**: If the third-party library is synchronous, you can offload it to a separate thread using `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` to prevent it from blocking the main event loop.\n\n   Here's an example of how you can do that:\n\n   ```python\n   import asyncio\n   from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor\n   import thirdPartyAPIWrapper\n\n   def fetch_data():\n       return thirdPartyAPIWrapper.data()\n\n   async def getData():\n       loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n       with ThreadPoolExecutor() as pool:\n           result = await loop.run_in_executor(pool, fetch_data)\n       return result\n\n   def main():\n       loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n       data = loop.run_until_complete(getData())\n       loop.close()\n       return data\n   ```\n\n3. **Convert to Async**: If the third-party library supports async operations but you're using the wrong function, see if there is an asynchronous version of the function you are calling, or check if there are alternative libraries that support async.\n\n4. **Modify the Third-Party Module**: If you have access to the source code of the third-party module, you could modify it to support asynchronous operations, though this is more complex and might not be feasible.\n\n5. **Alternative Libraries**: Consider using alternative libraries that natively support asynchronous operations if modifying the third-party library is not an option.\n\nBy using a thread pool, you can execute blocking code in a separate thread, preventing it from freezing your main application and allowing you to use asynchronous patterns elsewhere in your code."
