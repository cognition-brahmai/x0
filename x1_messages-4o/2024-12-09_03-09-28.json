I attempted to use the following code but it did not work:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\ndf=pd.DataFrame(['ONE','Two', np.nan],columns=['x']) \nxLower = df[\"x\"].map(lambda x: x.lower())\n```\n\nI need to tweak this code to get the output as `xLower = ['one','two',np.nan]`. The efficiency of the solution is crucial since the real dataframe is massive."

        "content": "To convert the strings in a pandas DataFrame column to lowercase while handling missing values efficiently, you can use the `str.lower()` method provided by pandas, which is optimized for handling such cases. This method will automatically skip `NaN` values without raising errors. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Create the DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame(['ONE', 'Two', np.nan], columns=['x'])\n\n# Convert the 'x' column to lowercase\nxLower = df['x'].str.lower()\n\n# Output the result\nprint(xLower)\n```\n\nThis will give you the desired output:\n\n```\n0    one\n1    two\n2    NaN\nName: x, dtype: object\n```\n\nBy using `str.lower()`, you leverage pandas' built-in string operations, which are optimized for performance and handle missing values (i.e., `NaN`) gracefully. This approach should be efficient even for large datasets."
