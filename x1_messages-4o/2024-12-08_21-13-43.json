We appreciate your honest review and sincerely apologize for the inconvenience you encountered with the color of your dress. We understand how important it is for the items to match your expectations, especially when it comes to style and shade.\n\nIt seems there may have been a mix-up with the color description. While \"Crimson Red\" and \"Burgundy\" are both beautiful shades, they can be quite different when it comes to matching your personal style or an event's theme. We recommend contacting our customer service team to explore options such as an exchange or a refund, ensuring you receive the exact \"Crimson Red\" dress you originally ordered.\n\nOn a brighter note, we've received positive feedback regarding the quality and fit of our dresses. Many customers have praised the durability and comfort of the fabric, as well as the flattering fit that complements various body types. We hope that once this issue is resolved, you'll enjoy the same high quality in your corrected order.\n\nThank you for your understanding and patience. We\u2019re committed to making this right and look forward to serving you better in the future."
