Currently, I am using the following code to iterate through rows of a data frame:\n\n```python\nfor index, row in df.iterrows():\n```\n\nIs there a way to modify this so that I can start iterating from a different row index instead of always beginning from the first row?"

        "content": "The `iterrows()` function in pandas iterates over DataFrame rows in the order they appear, starting from the first row by default. If you want to start iterating from a specific row index, you can slice the DataFrame before calling `iterrows()`. Here's how you can modify your code to start iterating from a different row index:\n\n```python\nstart_index = 5  # Specify the starting index here\n\n# Use DataFrame slicing to start from the desired index\nfor index, row in df.iloc[start_index:].iterrows():\n    # Your code to process each row\n    print(index, row)\n```\n\nIn this code, `df.iloc[start_index:]` creates a new DataFrame starting from the specified `start_index` to the end of the DataFrame. Then, `iterrows()` is called on this sliced DataFrame, allowing you to start the iteration from your desired row index. Adjust `start_index` according to your needs."
