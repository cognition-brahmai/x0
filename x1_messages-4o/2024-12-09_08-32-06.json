I've been trying to add some tools such as lightGBM, tensorflow, keras, bokeh and so on to my conda environment. However, when I use the command `conda install -c conda-forge packagename` for each of these tools, I find that there are a lot of downgrading and upgrading of different packages taking place. This is disrupting my installation and I can't use anything anymore after these installations. Is it possible to have multiple versions of packages & dependencies living alongside each other which won't affect my installation?"

        "content": "Yes, it's definitely possible to manage multiple versions of packages and their dependencies using conda environments. This helps in isolating different projects and their specific requirements without affecting each other. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide\n\n1. **Create a New Environment:**\n\n   Before installing any new package, it's a good practice to create a new environment. This will keep your base environment clean and ensure that changes don't affect other projects.\n\n   ```bash\n   conda create --name myenv python=3.6\n   ```\n\n   Replace `myenv` with a name of your choice for the environment. You can specify the Python version you need, as shown.\n\n2. **Activate the Environment:**\n\n   Once the environment is created, you need to activate it to install packages within it.\n\n   ```bash\n   conda activate myenv\n   ```\n\n3. **Install Packages:**\n\n   After activating your environment, you can install the packages you need.\n\n   ```bash\n   conda install -c conda-forge lightgbm tensorflow keras bokeh\n   ```\n\n   By installing packages in their own environment, you reduce the risk of conflicts and version issues.\n\n4. **Check Installed Packages:**\n\n   You can check which packages are installed and their versions within the environment using:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda list\n   ```\n\n5. **Switch Between Environments:**\n\n   You can switch between different environments using the `conda activate` command. To deactivate the current environment and return to the base environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda deactivate\n   ```\n\n6. **Remove Environments:**\n\n   If you ever need to remove an environment, you can do so with:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda remove --name myenv --all\n   ```\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- **Environment Files:** You can create an environment file that lists all the dependencies for a project. This makes it easier to replicate the environment on another machine or share it with others.\n\n  ```bash\n  conda env export > environment.yml\n  ```\n\n  And to recreate it:\n\n  ```bash\n  conda env create -f environment.yml\n  ```\n\n- **Virtual Environments:** If you encounter limitations with conda environments, consider using virtual environments or tools like `pipenv` for specific Python projects.\n\nBy organizing your projects with separate environments, you can maintain control over package versions and dependencies, ensuring that your projects remain stable and functional."
