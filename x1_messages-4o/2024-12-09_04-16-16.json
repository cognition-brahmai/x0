        "content": "To flush your Redis database using Python's `redis` library, you can use the `flushdb()` or `flushall()` methods provided by the library. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Install the `redis` library**: If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install redis\n   ```\n\n2. **Connect to your Redis server and flush the database**: You can use the following code to connect to your Redis server and flush the database:\n\n   ```python\n   import redis\n\n   # Connect to the Redis server\n   r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)\n\n   # Flush the current database\n   r.flushdb()\n   print(\"Database flushed successfully.\")\n\n   # Alternatively, to flush all databases:\n   # r.flushall()\n   # print(\"All databases flushed successfully.\")\n   ```\n\n   - `flushdb()` will remove all keys from the current database you are connected to.\n   - `flushall()` will remove all keys from all databases.\n\nMake sure to replace `'localhost'` and `6379` with your Redis server's host and port if they are different. Also, ensure you are aware of the implications of flushing a database, as it will permanently delete all data from the database(s)."
