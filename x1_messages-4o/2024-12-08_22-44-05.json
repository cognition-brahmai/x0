        "content": "To determine the frequency response of the specified digital filter, you can use the provided MATLAB code. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the code does:\n\n1. **Filter Specifications**: The filter is specified as a lowpass filter with a passband frequency (`Fpass`) of 0.2\\*\u03c0, a stopband frequency (`Fstop`) of 0.3\\*\u03c0, a passband ripple (`Apass`) of 0.1 dB, and a stopband attenuation (`Astop`) of 60 dB.\n\n2. **Normalized Frequencies**: The passband and stopband frequencies are normalized by dividing them by \u03c0/2 to suit MATLAB's `cheb1ord` function, which expects frequencies normalized to the Nyquist frequency (\u03c0 radians/sample).\n\n3. **Chebyshev Type I Filter Order Calculation**: The function `cheb1ord` calculates the minimum order `N` of the filter and the cutoff frequency `Wn` required to meet the given specifications.\n\n4. **Chebyshev Type I Filter Design**: The function `cheby1` designs the actual filter using the calculated order `N` and the passband ripple `Apass`, returning the filter coefficients `b` (numerator) and `a` (denominator).\n\n5. **Frequency Response Calculation**: The function `freqz` calculates the frequency response `H` of the filter over a range of frequencies `f`.\n\n6. **Plotting the Frequency Response**: The plot shows the magnitude of the frequency response in dB against the normalized frequency. This allows you to visualize the filter's behavior in the frequency domain.\n\nTo run this code, paste it into a MATLAB script or command window. The plot that emerges will show how the filter attenuates frequencies outside the passband, adhering to the specified ripple and attenuation levels. The transition between passband and stopband will be apparent around the normalized frequencies corresponding to 0.2\\*\u03c0 and 0.3\\*\u03c0."
