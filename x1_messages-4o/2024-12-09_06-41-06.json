When I run `test.head()`, I get the following output:\n\n[Output Image](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ijPPJm.png)\n\nClearly, the dataframe is a slice, so the index is out of bounds. I tried to reset the index for this dataframe using `test.reset_index(drop=True)`, which gave me the following output:\n\n[Output Image](https://i.stack.imgur.com/wEMvNm.png)\n\nHowever, running `test.head()` again shows me that the index has not changed. I also encountered problems when trying to use `lambda.apply` or `iterrows()`. How can I successfully reset the index of this dataframe?"

        "content": "When you're trying to reset the index of a Pandas DataFrame and the change doesn't seem to persist, it's likely because the `reset_index` method returns a new DataFrame by default, without modifying the original DataFrame in place. To address this, you have a couple of options:\n\n1. **Assign the result back to the DataFrame**: This will replace your original DataFrame with the one that has its index reset.\n\n   ```python\n   test = test.reset_index(drop=True)\n   ```\n\n2. **Use the `inplace` parameter**: This modifies the original DataFrame directly.\n\n   ```python\n   test.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)\n   ```\n\nEither of these approaches should resolve the issue and allow the index reset to be reflected in your DataFrame. \n\nIf you're encountering issues with `lambda.apply` or `iterrows()`, it might be useful to ensure that the DataFrame is correctly modified first. Once the index is reset properly, you should be able to use those methods without issue. If problems persist, check for any specific error messages that might provide additional context about what's going wrong."
