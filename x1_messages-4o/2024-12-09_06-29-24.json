I read that if you have a WSGI app and want to run it on Tornado's HTTPServer, you need to be careful because if your application is not prepared for an asynchronous server, it could block other requests while generating a response. On the other hand, Gunicorn is a Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX which uses a pre-fork worker model. I have a few questions regarding this:\n\n1. Does Gunicorn spawn worker process to handle the request? \n2. Does Gunicorn handle one concurrent request per worker?\n3. Does Tornado use `epoll` or `kqueue` to handle work in one process without a master/worker process?\n4. If I use a blocking call like `requests.get` in the handler's get/post function, will this block all the request handling or only the current request being handled?"

        "content": "Let's break down each of your questions to clarify how Tornado and Gunicorn handle requests:\n\n1. **Does Gunicorn spawn worker processes to handle requests?**\n\n   Yes, Gunicorn uses a pre-fork worker model, which means it spawns multiple worker processes to handle incoming requests. Each worker is a separate process that can handle requests independently. This means that if one worker is handling a long-running or blocking request, the other workers can still process other incoming requests. This model helps in utilizing multi-core systems effectively and improves the overall throughput of the server.\n\n2. **Does Gunicorn handle one concurrent request per worker?**\n\n   Typically, each Gunicorn worker handles one request at a time, especially if you're using synchronous workers (the default type). This means that a worker will not handle another request until it has finished processing the current one. However, Gunicorn also supports asynchronous workers, like `gevent` or `eventlet`, which can handle multiple requests concurrently by using cooperative multitasking.\n\n3. **Does Tornado use `epoll` or `kqueue` to handle work in one process without a master/worker process?**\n\n   Yes, Tornado uses `epoll` (on Linux) or `kqueue` (on BSD systems, including macOS) for its I/O loop. This allows Tornado to efficiently handle many simultaneous connections within a single process without needing a master/worker model. By using these non-blocking I/O event notification systems, Tornado can manage many open connections by reacting to events such as incoming data or readiness to send data, making it particularly well-suited for handling long-lived network connections.\n\n4. **If I use a blocking call like `requests.get` in the handler's get/post function, will this block all the request handling or only the current request being handled?**\n\n   In Tornado, if you use a blocking call like `requests.get` in a request handler, it will block the entire I/O loop, effectively blocking all request handling until the call completes. This is because Tornado's single-threaded event loop will be occupied with the blocking call and won't be able to process other requests. To avoid this, you'd typically use Tornado's asynchronous HTTP client (`AsyncHTTPClient`) or run the blocking code in a separate thread or process to prevent blocking the main event loop. In contrast, with Gunicorn's multiple worker processes, a blocking call in one worker will only block that specific worker, allowing other workers to continue handling other requests."
