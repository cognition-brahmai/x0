However, if I press ctrl-c while the dump operation is in progress, it gets interrupted and the resulting file ends up being corrupted, meaning it is only partially written and cannot be loaded again. My current workaround is to restart the operation if it is interrupted but I am looking for a more efficient way to defer the interrupt. Here's my current code:\n\n```python\ntry:\n  file = open(path, 'w')\n  dump(obj, file)\n  file.close()\nexcept KeyboardInterrupt:\n  file.close()\n  file.open(path,'w')\n  dump(obj, file)\n  file.close()\n  raise\n```"

        "content": "To ensure that a block of code in Python is not interrupted by a `KeyboardInterrupt`, you can use the `signal` module to temporarily ignore the interrupt signal during the critical section of your code. This way, you can prevent the `KeyboardInterrupt` from interrupting your `pickle.dump` operation. \n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport signal\nimport pickle\n\ndef ignore_interrupts(signum, frame):\n    pass\n\ndef dump_with_interrupt_protection(obj, path):\n    # Save the original signal handler\n    original_handler = signal.getsignal(signal.SIGINT)\n\n    try:\n        # Set the signal handler to ignore SIGINT\n        signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, ignore_interrupts)\n\n        # Perform the critical operation\n        with open(path, 'wb') as file:\n            pickle.dump(obj, file)\n\n    finally:\n        # Restore the original signal handler\n        signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, original_handler)\n\n# Usage\ntry:\n    dump_with_interrupt_protection(your_object, 'your_path.pkl')\nexcept KeyboardInterrupt:\n    print(\"Operation interrupted after the critical section.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Signal Handling**: The `signal` module allows you to set signal handlers for various signals. `signal.SIGINT` is the signal for `KeyboardInterrupt` which is sent when you press `Ctrl+C`.\n\n2. **Custom Signal Handler**: We define a function `ignore_interrupts` that does nothing and assign it as the handler for `SIGINT`. This effectively ignores `KeyboardInterrupt` during the critical section.\n\n3. **Restoration**: After the critical section is complete, we restore the original signal handler to ensure that the program can still respond to `KeyboardInterrupt` as expected outside the critical section.\n\n4. **Context Management**: Using a `with` statement to open the file ensures that the file is properly closed, even if an exception occurs.\n\nThis method is efficient and ensures that the `pickle.dump` operation is not interrupted, preventing file corruption."
