        "content": "In Django, the `clean()` method is not automatically called when you create or save a model instance directly. The `clean()` method is primarily used within Django forms to perform validation before saving model instances. If you want the `clean()` method to be called when creating or saving models directly (e.g., during a CSV import), you have to explicitly call it yourself.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can modify your import logic to ensure the `clean()` method is invoked:\n\n1. **Explicitly Call `full_clean()`**: Before saving a model instance, you can call `full_clean()`, which will in turn call the `clean()` method and perform any additional validation you have specified.\n\n2. **Example Implementation**: Modify your CSV import logic to include a call to `full_clean()` before saving the model instance.\n\nHere is a conceptual example of how you might implement this:\n\n```python\n# Assume this is part of your CSV import logic\nfor data in csv_data:\n    common_measurement = CommonMeasurement(\n        timestamp=data['timestamp'],\n        value=data['value'],\n        run=data['run'],\n    )\n    \n    # Call full_clean to run clean methods and validation\n    try:\n        common_measurement.full_clean()\n        common_measurement.save()\n    except django_exceptions.ValidationError as e:\n        # Handle validation error (e.g., log it, report it, etc.)\n        print(\"Validation Error:\", e)\n```\n\n3. **Handling Validation Errors**: When you call `full_clean()`, it may raise a `ValidationError` if any validation checks fail. You should be prepared to handle these exceptions, perhaps by logging them or notifying the user.\n\n4. **Ensure Import Logic Has Access to Runs**: Make sure that during the import, the `run` field is correctly referenced, as the validation relies on the `run.timestamp_start` and `run.timestamp_end` fields.\n\n5. **Form Handling**: If you\u2019re using forms to handle file uploads, ensure that they also have appropriate validation logic if needed. However, since the main concern is about the model\u2019s `clean()` method, ensure it\u2019s called during your import logic as shown.\n\nBy ensuring that `full_clean()` is called in your CSV processing logic, you should be able to leverage the `clean()` method for validation as intended."
