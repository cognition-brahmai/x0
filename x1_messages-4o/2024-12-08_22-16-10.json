        "content": "The example R code you provided has some issues, particularly with the conversion of numerical values to binary and decimal representations. Here's a corrected version of the code that achieves what you want:\n\n```r\n# Define the range of exponents\nexponentials <- 1:5\n\n# Calculate the numerical values of 2 raised to the power of the exponents\nvalues <- 2^exponentials\n\n# Convert each value to its binary representation\nbinary <- sapply(values, function(x) paste(rev(as.integer(intToBits(x)[1:ceiling(log2(max(values)))])), collapse = \"\"))\n\n# The decimal representation is the same as the numerical value in this case\ndecimal <- values\n\n# Create a data frame with the results\ntable <- data.frame(\n  Exponential = exponentials,\n  Numerical_Value = values,\n  Binary_Representation = binary,\n  Decimal_Representation = decimal\n)\n\n# Sort the table in descending order of the decimal values\ntable <- table[order(table$Decimal_Representation, decreasing = TRUE),]\n\n# Print the table\nprint(table)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- The `intToBits` function is used to obtain the binary representation of a number, but it needs to be reversed and trimmed to the appropriate length.\n- The binary representation is obtained by taking the integer bits, reversing them, and pasting them together.\n- In this specific task, the decimal representation is the same as the numerical value.\n- The table is sorted in descending order based on the `Decimal_Representation` column. \n\nThis code will produce a table of the exponential values of 2, along with their binary and decimal representations, sorted in descending order by the decimal values."
