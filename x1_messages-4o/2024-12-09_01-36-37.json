For instance, for the file path \"C:\\folder1\\folder2\\filename.xml\", I want to retrieve the folder name \"folder2\". Currently, I am using the os.path.split command twice as shown below:\n\n```python\nfolderName = os.path.split(os.path.split(\"C:\\folder1\\folder2\\filename.xml\")[0])[1]\n```\n\nIs there a more efficient or cleaner way to achieve this?"

You can use the `os.path.dirname` function in combination with `os.path.basename` to get the name of the parent directory of the file. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nfile_path = r\"C:\\folder1\\folder2\\filename.xml\"\nfolder_name = os.path.basename(os.path.dirname(file_path))\n\nprint(folder_name)\n```\n\nIn this code, `os.path.dirname(file_path)` returns the directory path of the file, which in this case is `\"C:\\folder1\\folder2\"`. Then, `os.path.basename(...)` extracts the last part of this path, which is `\"folder2\"`. This approach is cleaner and more straightforward than splitting the path twice."
