It is a simple portfolio app with no models, no bootstrap, just Django, HTML, CSS & Javascript. After pulling it from the Github repo onto pythonanywhere with their bash console, I run `python manage.py migrate` and encounter the following error: `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet`. I have tried adding `import django` and `django.setup()` to my settings.py as suggested in a post but it's not resolving the issue. I am lost and unsure of how to resolve this. Can anyone help shed some light on what might be the problem?"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering, `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet`, typically suggests that Django is trying to execute some code before the application registry is fully populated. This can happen for a variety of reasons, but let's go through some steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Your WSGI File:**\n   - Ensure that your WSGI configuration on PythonAnywhere is correct. Your WSGI file should be pointing to your Django project's WSGI application. It usually looks like this:\n\n     ```python\n     import os\n     import sys\n\n     # Add your project directory to the sys.path\n     project_home = '/home/yourusername/yourproject'\n     if project_home not in sys.path:\n         sys.path = [project_home] + sys.path\n\n     # Set the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable\n     os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'yourproject.settings'\n\n     # Import django and setup the application\n     import django\n     django.setup()\n\n     # Import your WSGI application\n     from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application\n     application = get_wsgi_application()\n     ```\n\n   - Make sure you replace `yourusername` and `yourproject` with your actual PythonAnywhere username and Django project name.\n\n2. **Check Your Installed Apps:**\n   - Verify that all the apps listed in the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting in your `settings.py` file are correct and do not contain any typos or missing apps. Ensure that you have `'django.contrib.admin'`, `'django.contrib.auth'`, `'django.contrib.contenttypes'`, and other essential apps included.\n\n3. **Verify Migrations Directory:**\n   - Make sure that you have a `migrations` directory with an `__init__.py` file in each of your apps, even if they don't have models. This can sometimes affect migrations.\n\n4. **Check for Circular Imports:**\n   - Circular imports can sometimes lead to this error. Check if there are any circular dependencies in your import statements across your Django project, especially in `models.py` or `views.py`.\n\n5. **Virtual Environment:**\n   - Ensure your virtual environment is activated in the PythonAnywhere console where you're running the `migrate` command. You can activate it using:\n\n     ```bash\n     source /home/yourusername/.virtualenvs/yourvirtualenv/bin/activate\n     ```\n\n6. **Static Files:**\n   - While not directly related to the error, make sure your static files are correctly configured in `settings.py` and ensure that the `collectstatic` command has been run if you have custom CSS or JS files.\n\n7. **Logs and Error Messages:**\n   - Check the error logs on PythonAnywhere for any additional information. These logs can provide more context on what might be going wrong.\n\nIf you've gone through these steps and are still experiencing issues, consider providing more details, such as your `settings.py` file or any custom management commands you might be running, to get a more tailored solution."
