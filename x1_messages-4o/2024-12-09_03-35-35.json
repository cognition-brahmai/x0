Many solutions suggest using itertools.combinations, but it only returns a subset of what I need. Specifically, it returns items in a strict order, and misses out on combinations like (2, 1), (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1, 3), (3, 1, 2), (2, 3, 1), and (3, 2, 1). Is there a workaround to get every possible combination regardless of order? Here's the code I am using now:\n```python\nstuff = [1, 2, 3]\nfor L in range(0, len(stuff)+1):\n    for subset in itertools.combinations(stuff, L):\n        print(subset)\n```\nThis is the output I am receiving:\n```\n()\n(1,)\n(2,)\n(3,)\n(1, 2)\n(1, 3)\n(2, 3)\n(1, 2, 3)\n```"

        "content": "To generate all possible combinations of a list where order does matter (which are essentially permutations), you can use `itertools.permutations`. This will give you every possible ordering of the elements in the list.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nstuff = [1, 2, 3]\nfor L in range(0, len(stuff)+1):\n    for subset in itertools.permutations(stuff, L):\n        print(subset)\n```\n\nThis will output all possible permutations of the list `stuff`, including all possible orderings of each subset of the list:\n\n```\n()\n(1,)\n(2,)\n(3,)\n(1, 2)\n(1, 3)\n(2, 1)\n(2, 3)\n(3, 1)\n(3, 2)\n(1, 2, 3)\n(1, 3, 2)\n(2, 1, 3)\n(2, 3, 1)\n(3, 1, 2)\n(3, 2, 1)\n```\n\nThis includes all the combinations you mentioned like `(2, 1)`, `(3, 2, 1)`, etc. The `itertools.permutations` function generates all possible orderings, and by iterating over different lengths `L`, you get permutations of all possible lengths."
