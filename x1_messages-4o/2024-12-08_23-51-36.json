Below is a concise summary of an article on climate change using LaTeX, focusing on the impact of greenhouse gases on the planet's surface and the resulting changes in weather patterns and ecosystems.\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\title{Summary of Climate Change Article}\n\\author{}\n\\date{}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\section*{Introduction}\nClimate change is a critical global issue primarily driven by the increase of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the Earth's atmosphere. These gases, including carbon dioxide (\\( \\text{CO}_2 \\)), methane (\\( \\text{CH}_4 \\)), and nitrous oxide (\\( \\text{N}_2\\text{O} \\)), trap heat and lead to a warming effect known as the greenhouse effect.\n\n\\section*{Impact on Planet's Surface}\nThe accumulation of GHGs has significant impacts on the Earth's surface:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Global Warming:} The average global temperature has risen, leading to the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers.\n    \\item \\textbf{Sea Level Rise:} As ice melts, sea levels rise, threatening coastal communities and ecosystems.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section*{Changes in Weather Patterns}\nThe alteration of weather patterns due to climate change is evident:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Extreme Weather Events:} Increased frequency and intensity of hurricanes, floods, droughts, and heatwaves.\n    \\item \\textbf{Altered Precipitation:} Shifts in rainfall patterns, affecting water availability for agriculture and consumption.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section*{Impact on Ecosystems}\nEcosystems are experiencing drastic changes:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Species Migration:} Many species are migrating to cooler areas, disrupting local ecosystems.\n    \\item \\textbf{Biodiversity Loss:} Habitat destruction and changing conditions are leading to a decline in biodiversity.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section*{Conclusion}\nThe increase in greenhouse gases is a major driver of climate change, affecting the Earth's surface, weather patterns, and ecosystems. Mitigation efforts and adaptation strategies are essential to address these challenges.\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nThis LaTeX document provides a structured summary of the key points related to climate change and its impacts. You can compile this code using a LaTeX editor to generate the final document."
