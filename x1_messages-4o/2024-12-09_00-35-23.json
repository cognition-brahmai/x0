The HTML source has `h3` headers, `ul` lists containing `li` items, and some of these `li` items contain nested `ul` lists. I want to extract all `li` tags following the first `h3` tag and stopping at the next `h2` tag, including all nested `li` tags. I have the start point identified correctly with `firstH3 = soup.find('h3')`, but I'm unsure of how to proceed from there. How can I achieve this extraction?"

        "content": "To accomplish the task of extracting all `li` tags following the first `h3` tag up until the next `h2` tag, you can use the BeautifulSoup library in Python. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you achieve this:\n\n1. **Install BeautifulSoup and Requests**: If you haven't already, you'll need to install the BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries. You can do this using pip:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install beautifulsoup4 requests\n    ```\n\n2. **Set Up Your Script**: Import the necessary libraries and set up your script to pull the webpage content.\n\n3. **Find the Relevant Tags**: Start from the identified `h3` tag and iterate through the siblings until you reach the next `h2` tag.\n\n4. **Collect the `li` Tags**: As you iterate through the elements, collect all the `li` tags.\n\nHere's a sample code implementation:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n# Request the webpage content\nurl = \"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000s_in_film\"\nresponse = requests.get(url)\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')\n\n# Find the first `h3` tag\nfirst_h3 = soup.find('h3')\n\n# Initialize a list to collect movie titles and years\nmovie_list = []\n\n# Traverse through the elements following the first `h3` tag\nfor sibling in first_h3.find_all_next():\n    # Stop if you reach an `h2` tag\n    if sibling.name == 'h2':\n        break\n    # If the tag is an `li`, extract the text\n    if sibling.name == 'li':\n        # Append the text content of the `li` tag to the movie_list\n        movie_list.append(sibling.get_text())\n\n# Print the collected movie titles and years\nfor movie in movie_list:\n    print(movie)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Requests**: Used to fetch the HTML content of the target webpage.\n- **BeautifulSoup**: Parses the HTML content into a navigable format.\n- **find('h3')**: Locates the first `h3` tag, which serves as the starting point.\n- **find_all_next()**: Iterates over all elements following the first `h3`.\n- **Breaking on `h2`**: The loop stops collecting data once it encounters the next `h2` tag.\n- **Appending `li` content**: Only the `li` tags are of interest, so their text content is extracted and appended to the `movie_list`.\n\nThis script will give you a list of movie titles and years formatted as \"Movie Title (Year)\" from the specified section of the Wikipedia page."
