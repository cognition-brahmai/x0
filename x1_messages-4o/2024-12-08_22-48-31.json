        "content": "The coronavirus pandemic triggered an unprecedented economic downturn in the United States, with widespread lockdowns causing a sharp contraction in GDP and skyrocketing unemployment rates. The government responded with massive fiscal stimulus packages, including direct payments to individuals and support for businesses, to mitigate the impact. Supply chain disruptions and shifts in consumer behavior accelerated digital transformation and remote work adoption, reshaping various industries. As the economy began to recover, challenges such as inflation and labor shortages emerged, partly due to the rapid reopening and pent-up demand. Despite initial setbacks, the crisis also spurred innovation and adaptation, highlighting the resilience and agility of the U.S. economy."
