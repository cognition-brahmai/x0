The structure is as follows:\n\n```\nnew_project/\n    antigravity/\n        antigravity.py\n    test/\n        test_antigravity.py\n    setup.py\n    etc.\n```\nWhen I try to run `python test_antigravity.py` from the test directory, it fails because `import antigravity` cannot find the module as it's not on the path. I am aware of modifying PYTHONPATH and other search path related methods but I believe there should be a simpler way. Copying the test file into the other directory also seems inefficient. What is the usual way of running these tests without requiring users to modify their PYTHONPATH or move files around?"

        "content": "In Python, a common way to handle this situation is to use a test runner or a tool that automatically discovers and runs your tests while managing the import paths for you. Here are a few recommended approaches:\n\n1. **Using `pytest`:**\n\n   `pytest` is a powerful testing framework that not only discovers and runs your tests but also handles imports more gracefully. You can install it with `pip`:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pytest\n   ```\n\n   Then, from the root directory of your project (`new_project/`), run:\n\n   ```bash\n   pytest\n   ```\n\n   `pytest` will automatically discover the `test` directory and run the tests within it, taking care of the import paths.\n\n2. **Using `unittest` with `python -m`:**\n\n   If you prefer to stick with Python's built-in `unittest` framework, you can use the `-m` switch to run tests as a module, which ensures the current directory is added to the path:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m unittest discover -s test\n   ```\n\n   This command should be run from the root of your project (`new_project/`). It will discover and run all test files that match the pattern `test*.py` in the `test` directory.\n\n3. **Adjusting the `sys.path` in the `test_antigravity.py`:**\n\n   While not as clean as using a test runner, you can modify the `sys.path` at the beginning of your test script to include the parent directory, thus making the `antigravity` module importable:\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   import os\n\n   # Add the parent directory to sys.path\n   sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..')))\n\n   import antigravity\n   ```\n\n   This is more of a workaround and is typically not recommended for larger projects, but it can be useful for quick tests.\n\nOverall, using `pytest` or `unittest` with the `-m` switch are the most common and efficient ways to handle this situation. They are scalable and work well as your project grows."
