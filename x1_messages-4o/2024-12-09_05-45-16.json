        "content": "Yes, Docker supports this functionality through the use of volume mounts. By mounting a local directory or file into the Docker container, you can access the files outside the container and store output files in a location on your host machine. Here's how you can modify your setup to accomplish this:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide:\n\n1. **Modify the `docker run` Command:**\n\n   You need to use the `-v` or `--volume` flag to mount the local directories into the Docker container. Here's how you can modify your command:\n\n   ```bash\n   docker run -v /my/local/location/outside/docker:/data \\\n     your_image_name python /app/script.py --input /data/input.csv --output /data/output.csv\n   ```\n\n   In this command:\n   - `/my/local/location/outside/docker` is the local directory on your host machine.\n   - `/data` is the directory inside the Docker container where the local directory is mounted.\n   - You pass the paths `/data/input.csv` and `/data/output.csv` to your script as these are the paths inside the container.\n\n2. **Adjust the Dockerfile (if necessary):**\n\n   Your Dockerfile looks mostly fine, but ensure that all necessary Python packages are listed in `requirements.txt` so they can be installed during the build process. Also, consider using `python3` and `pip3` if you need Python 3:\n\n   ```dockerfile\n   FROM phusion/baseimage\n\n   RUN apt-get update\n   RUN apt-get install -y build-essential python3-dev python3-pip python3-numpy python3-scipy\n\n   COPY ./requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt\n   RUN pip3 install -r /app/requirements.txt\n\n   COPY ./src/script.py /app/script.py\n\n   WORKDIR /app\n   ```\n\n3. **Build Your Docker Image:**\n\n   Make sure to build your Docker image with a tag for easy reference:\n\n   ```bash\n   docker build -t your_image_name .\n   ```\n\n4. **Run the Docker Container:**\n\n   Use the modified `docker run` command as shown above to execute your script with the input and output files located outside the container.\n\nBy setting it up this way, you ensure that your input and output files remain on your host machine, giving you flexibility in managing them without needing to rebuild or modify the Docker image/container each time you run your script."
