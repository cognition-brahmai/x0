In the `Hero` class, I've defined `__hash__` method to return hash of the string representation of an object. However, when I add three objects to a set, where the first and third objects have the same content and same hash, the `len()` function is returning 3, indicating that there are three unique objects, which is not the expected behavior. Here's the code I'm working with:\n\n```python\nclass Hero:\n    def __init__(self, name, age):\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return self.name + str(self.age)\n\n    def __hash__(self):\n        print(hash(str(self)))\n        return hash(str(self))\n\nheroes = set()\n\nheroes.add(Hero('Zina Portnova', 16)) # gets hash -8926039986155829407\nprint(len(heroes)) # gets 1\n\nheroes.add(Hero('Lara Miheenko', 17)) # gets hash -2822451113328084695\nprint(len(heroes)) # gets 2\n\nheroes.add(Hero('Zina Portnova', 16)) # gets hash -8926039986155829407\nprint(len(heroes)) # gets 3\n```\n\nWhy are the first and third objects considered unique despite having the same content and hash?"

        "content": "The issue arises because, in Python, for an object to be considered equal to another object in a set or as a dictionary key, it must have both the same hash value and report as equal to another instance when compared with `==`. By default, the `==` operator compares object identities, which means it checks if both objects are the same instance (i.e., they have the same memory address). Since the `Hero` class does not override the `__eq__` method, the default behavior is used, and each instance is considered unique even if they have the same content and hash.\n\nTo resolve this, you need to implement the `__eq__` method to also compare the `name` and `age` attributes to determine if two `Hero` objects are equal. Here's how you can modify your class:\n\n```python\nclass Hero:\n    def __init__(self, name, age):\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return self.name + str(self.age)\n\n    def __hash__(self):\n        return hash((self.name, self.age))\n\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        return isinstance(other, Hero) and self.name == other.name and self.age == other.age\n\nheroes = set()\n\nheroes.add(Hero('Zina Portnova', 16))\nprint(len(heroes)) # gets 1\n\nheroes.add(Hero('Lara Miheenko', 17))\nprint(len(heroes)) # gets 2\n\nheroes.add(Hero('Zina Portnova', 16))\nprint(len(heroes)) # gets 2\n```\n\nWith this change, when you add a new `Hero` object to the set, Python will now correctly identify whether another `Hero` object with the same `name` and `age` already exists, thanks to the combination of `__hash__` and `__eq__` methods."
