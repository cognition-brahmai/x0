However, when I try to generate a new column that represents the day of the week, I'm getting an error. The error message I'm getting is \"'Series' object has no attribute 'weekday'\". Here's what I've tried:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport csv\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv', parse_dates=['date']))\ndf['day-of-week'] = df['date'].weekday()\n```\n\nHow can I correctly create a new column that indicates the day of the week?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering occurs because you're trying to apply the `weekday()` method directly on a Pandas Series object, which doesn't have this method. Instead, you should use the `dt` accessor to apply the `weekday` method to the `date` column. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read the CSV file and parse the 'date' column as dates\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv', parse_dates=['date'])\n\n# Use the dt accessor to get the weekday\ndf['day-of-week'] = df['date'].dt.weekday\n\n# If you want the day of the week as a name (e.g., 'Monday', 'Tuesday')\ndf['day-name'] = df['date'].dt.day_name()\n\n# Display the DataFrame to verify the new columns\nprint(df)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- `parse_dates=['date']` ensures that the 'date' column is parsed as a datetime object.\n- `df['date'].dt.weekday` returns the day of the week as an integer (Monday=0, Sunday=6).\n- `df['date'].dt.day_name()` returns the name of the day (e.g., 'Monday', 'Tuesday').\n\nThis should work correctly and add the new columns indicating the day of the week in your DataFrame."
