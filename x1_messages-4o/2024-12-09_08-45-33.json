I've registered a router in my urls.py like this:\n\n```python\nrouter = DefaultRouter()\nrouter.register(r'my-list', MyViewSet, base_name=\"my_list\")\n\nurlpatterns = [\n    url(r'^api/', include(router.urls,\n                          namespace='api'), ),\n]\n```\n\nI want to use something like `reverse` in my tests.py. Currently, I'm using hard coded string like this:\n\n```python\nresponse = self.client.get('/api/my-list/')\n```\n\nBut if I try to use `reverse` like this:\n\n```python\nresponse = self.client.get(reverse('api:my_list')\n```\n\nI'm getting a `NoReverseMatch` error. Here's the error message:\n\n```python\ndjango.core.urlresolvers.NoReverseMatch: Reverse for 'my_list' with arguments '()' and keyword arguments '{}' not found. 0 pattern(s) tried: []\n```\n\nHow can I fix this?"

        "content": "The `NoReverseMatch` error you're encountering suggests that Django is unable to find a URL pattern that matches the name you've provided. There are a few things you should check and adjust:\n\n1. **Check the `base_name` Parameter:**\n   The `base_name` parameter is deprecated in favor of `basename` in recent versions of Django Rest Framework. Ensure you are using the correct parameter name and update it if necessary:\n\n   ```python\n   router.register(r'my-list', MyViewSet, basename=\"my_list\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Use the Correct URL Pattern Name:**\n   When you register a viewset with a router, it automatically registers several URL patterns (e.g., list, detail). The name for the list view is typically in the format of `'{basename}-list'`.\n\n   Therefore, in your test, you should try reversing the URL with the name:\n\n   ```python\n   response = self.client.get(reverse('api:my_list-list'))\n   ```\n\n3. **Ensure Namespace is Correct:**\n   Make sure that the namespace you are using in `include()` matches the namespace used in `reverse()`. You specified `namespace='api'`, so ensure that `reverse()` includes it:\n\n   ```python\n   response = self.client.get(reverse('api:my_list-list'))\n   ```\n\n4. **Ensure URLs Are Loaded:**\n   Make sure that your URLs are properly configured and loaded in your test environment. You can try running `python manage.py show_urls` (if you have `django-extensions` installed) to see a list of all registered URLs and confirm that `my_list-list` is present.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `NoReverseMatch` error and correctly use `reverse` in your tests."
