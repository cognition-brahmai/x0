        "content": "In Python, I am utilizing ctypes to load a DLL for a module named `wrapper.py` that wraps a C DLL. The DLL is located in the same directory as the module and I am using the following code to load it: `myDll = ctypes.CDLL(\"MyCDLL.dll\")`. This works fine when I execute `wrapper.py` from its own directory. However, it fails when I run it from a different location since ctypes computes the path relative to the current working directory. How can I specify the DLL's path relative to the wrapper instead of the current working directory? This would allow me to bundle the two together and enable the user to run/import the wrapper from any location."

        "content": "To ensure that your `wrapper.py` can locate the DLL relative to its own location, regardless of the current working directory from which it is run, you can use the `__file__` attribute to determine the directory that contains the `wrapper.py` file. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport ctypes\n\n# Get the directory where the current script (wrapper.py) is located\nscript_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))\n\n# Construct the full path to the DLL\ndll_path = os.path.join(script_dir, \"MyCDLL.dll\")\n\n# Load the DLL using the full path\nmyDll = ctypes.CDLL(dll_path)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **`os.path.abspath(__file__)`:** This gives you the absolute path of the `wrapper.py` script.\n2. **`os.path.dirname(...)`:** This extracts the directory from the full path of the script.\n3. **`os.path.join(...)`:** This constructs the full path to the DLL by joining the script's directory and the DLL's filename.\n4. **`ctypes.CDLL(...)`:** This loads the DLL using the full path, ensuring that it is found regardless of the working directory.\n\nBy using this approach, your `wrapper.py` script will always look for `MyCDLL.dll` in the same directory as itself, allowing for more flexible usage."
