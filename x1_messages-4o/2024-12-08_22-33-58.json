        "content": "To create a MATLAB script that generates a haiku based on a given input sentence and includes a reference to a celestial body, you can use the provided example as a starting point. However, to ensure the haiku adheres to the traditional 5-7-5 syllable structure, you'll need to make some modifications. Here's an enhanced version of the code:\n\n```matlab\n% Define the input sentence\ninput_sentence = \"I felt an ineffable joy like the universe smiled.\";\n\n% Split the input sentence into words\nwords = split(input_sentence);\n\n% Function to count syllables in a word (basic approximation)\nfunction count = syllable_count(word)\n    vowels = 'aeiouy';\n    word = lower(word);\n    count = 0;\n    if any(vowels == word(1))\n        count = count + 1;\n    end\n    for i = 2:length(word)\n        if any(vowels == word(i)) && ~any(vowels == word(i-1))\n            count = count + 1;\n        end\n    end\nend\n\n% Choose a celestial body randomly\ncelestial_bodies = [\"moon\", \"star\", \"sun\", \"comet\", \"nebula\"];\ncelestial_body = celestial_bodies(randi(length(celestial_bodies)));\n\n% Initialize haiku\nhaiku = strings(3, 1);\n\n% Generate the haiku\n% Line 1: 5 syllables\nsyllable_target = 5;\nsyllable_count_total = 0;\nline = [];\nfor i = 1:length(words)\n    word_syllables = syllable_count(words{i});\n    if (syllable_count_total + word_syllables) <= syllable_target\n        line = [line, words{i}];\n        syllable_count_total = syllable_count_total + word_syllables;\n    else\n        break;\n    end\nend\nhaiku(1) = join(line, \" \");\n\n% Line 2: 7 syllables\nsyllable_target = 7;\nsyllable_count_total = 0;\nline = [];\nfor i = length(line)+1:length(words)\n    word_syllables = syllable_count(words{i});\n    if (syllable_count_total + word_syllables) <= syllable_target\n        line = [line, words{i}];\n        syllable_count_total = syllable_count_total + word_syllables;\n    else\n        break;\n    end\nend\nhaiku(2) = join(line, \" \");\n\n% Line 3: 5 syllables, include celestial body\nhaiku(3) = sprintf(\"In the %s light,\", celestial_body);\n\n% Display the haiku\ndisp(haiku);\n```\n\n### Key Enhancements:\n\n1. **Syllable Count Function**: The `syllable_count` function provides a basic approximation for counting syllables in English words. Note that this is a simplified approach and might not be entirely accurate for all words.\n\n2. **Dynamic Haiku Construction**: The code constructs each line of the haiku by considering the syllable count. It attempts to stay within the traditional 5-7-5 syllable structure.\n\n3. **Inclusion of Celestial Body**: Ensures the celestial body is part of the final line of the haiku.\n\nThis script generates a haiku based on the input sentence while adhering to the traditional haiku format and includes a celestial reference. You can further improve the syllable counting function for greater accuracy."
