The first job requires completing 100 data entries within 24 hours, offering $50 upon completion. The second job is a social media management task that involves creating and scheduling 10 posts within a week, offering $100 upon completion. Lastly, the third job involves writing a 1,000-word article on a given topic, paying $200 upon completion. However, your dilemma is that you can only accept one job at a time, and you need to consider the time and effort required for each task, and how much you can earn per hour. For instance, you may earn $12.50 per hour for the data entry project, which may take you four hours to complete, or $25 per hour for the writing project, which may take you eight hours to complete. Can you strategize and come up with an optimized plan to maximize your hourly earnings?"
