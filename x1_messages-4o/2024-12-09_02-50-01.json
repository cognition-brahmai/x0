Ideally, I would like to express the difference in terms like '32 seconds', '17 minutes', '22.3 hours', '1.25 days', '3.5 weeks', '2 months' and '4.25 years'. Alternatively, I would like to express the difference as '4 years, 6 months, 3 weeks, 4 days, 6 hours 21 minutes and 15 seconds'. I am unsure if I can use `strptime`, as I am not working with strings, but the difference of two epoch timestamps. Is there a Python module that I can use for this?"

        "content": "To achieve a human-readable format for the difference between two UNIX timestamps, you can use Python's `datetime` module in combination with some custom logic to handle the conversion of time differences into more descriptive terms. Here's a step-by-step way to do this:\n\n1. Calculate the difference between the two timestamps.\n2. Convert the difference into a `timedelta` object to break it down into different units.\n3. Use custom logic to convert the `timedelta` into a more human-readable format.\n\nHere's a Python function that demonstrates this:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\ndef human_readable_time_difference(start_timestamp, end_timestamp):\n    # Calculate the difference in seconds\n    diff_seconds = end_timestamp - start_timestamp\n\n    # Create a timedelta object\n    delta = timedelta(seconds=diff_seconds)\n\n    # Breakdown the difference into years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds\n    years = delta.days // 365\n    days_remaining = delta.days % 365\n    months = days_remaining // 30\n    days = days_remaining % 30\n    weeks = days // 7\n    days = days % 7\n    hours, remainder = divmod(delta.seconds, 3600)\n    minutes, seconds = divmod(remainder, 60)\n\n    # Construct the human-readable format\n    parts = []\n    if years > 0:\n        parts.append(f\"{years} year{'s' if years != 1 else ''}\")\n    if months > 0:\n        parts.append(f\"{months} month{'s' if months != 1 else ''}\")\n    if weeks > 0:\n        parts.append(f\"{weeks} week{'s' if weeks != 1 else ''}\")\n    if days > 0:\n        parts.append(f\"{days} day{'s' if days != 1 else ''}\")\n    if hours > 0:\n        parts.append(f\"{hours} hour{'s' if hours != 1 else ''}\")\n    if minutes > 0:\n        parts.append(f\"{minutes} minute{'s' if minutes != 1 else ''}\")\n    if seconds > 0:\n        parts.append(f\"{seconds} second{'s' if seconds != 1 else ''}\")\n\n    return ', '.join(parts)\n\n# Example usage\nstart_timestamp = 1609459200  # Corresponds to 2021-01-01 00:00:00 UTC\nend_timestamp = 1672531199    # Corresponds to 2023-01-01 00:00:00 UTC\n\nprint(human_readable_time_difference(start_timestamp, end_timestamp))\n```\n\nThis function calculates the difference between two timestamps and expresses it in a human-readable format. Note that this is a simplified calculation and assumes a fixed number of days for each month (30 days) and each year (365 days). You can adjust these calculations as needed to accommodate more precise calendar calculations, such as accounting for leap years or varying month lengths."
