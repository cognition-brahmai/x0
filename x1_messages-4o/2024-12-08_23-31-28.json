        "content": "Certainly! The universe is governed by four fundamental forces, each with unique properties and functions. Here's a detailed explanation of each:\n\n### 1. Gravitational Force\n- **Description**: Gravity is the force of attraction between two masses. It is the weakest of the four forces but has an infinite range.\n- **Strength**: Weakest of all fundamental forces.\n- **Range of Influence**: Infinite; decreases with the square of the distance between the masses.\n- **Formula**: \\( F = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \\) where \\( F \\) is the force between masses, \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant, \\( m_1 \\) and \\( m_2 \\) are the masses, and \\( r \\) is the distance between the centers of the two masses.\n\n### 2. Electromagnetic Force\n- **Description**: This force acts between charged particles. It is responsible for electricity, magnetism, and light.\n- **Strength**: Much stronger than gravity.\n- **Range of Influence**: Infinite; like gravity, it decreases with the square of the distance.\n- **Formula**: \\( F = k \\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \\) where \\( F \\) is the force between charges, \\( k \\) is Coulomb's constant, \\( q_1 \\) and \\( q_2 \\) are the amounts of charge, and \\( r \\) is the distance between the charges.\n\n### 3. Strong Nuclear Force\n- **Description**: This force binds protons and neutrons in an atomic nucleus. It is the strongest of the four forces.\n- **Strength**: Strongest of all fundamental forces.\n- **Range of Influence**: Very short (approximately 1 femtometer, \\(10^{-15}\\) meters).\n- **Note**: It does not have a simple formula like gravity or electromagnetic forces due to its complexity.\n\n### 4. Weak Nuclear Force\n- **Description**: This force is responsible for radioactive decay and neutrino interactions.\n- **Strength**: Stronger than gravity, but weaker than electromagnetic and strong nuclear forces.\n- **Range of Influence**: Very short (less than 0.1% of the diameter of a proton, approximately \\(10^{-18}\\) meters).\n\n### Comparison\n- **Strength**: Strong nuclear > Electromagnetic > Weak nuclear > Gravitational.\n- **Range**: Gravitational and electromagnetic forces have infinite range, while nuclear forces have very short range.\n\n### Java Code Example\nBelow is a simple Java example to simulate gravitational and electromagnetic forces. Note that simulating nuclear forces is more complex and often requires specialized software or libraries.\n\n```java\npublic class ForceSimulation {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Example masses and charges\n        double mass1 = 5.98e24; // Earth mass in kg\n        double mass2 = 7.35e22; // Moon mass in kg\n        double distance = 3.84e8; // Distance between Earth and Moon in meters\n\n        double charge1 = 1.6e-19; // Charge in Coulombs (e.g., electron)\n        double charge2 = 1.6e-19; // Charge in Coulombs (e.g., proton)\n\n        // Calculate gravitational force\n        double gravitationalForce = calculateGravitationalForce(mass1, mass2, distance);\n        System.out.println(\"Gravitational Force: \" + gravitationalForce + \" N\");\n\n        // Calculate electromagnetic force\n        double electromagneticForce = calculateElectromagneticForce(charge1, charge2, distance);\n        System.out.println(\"Electromagnetic Force: \" + electromagneticForce + \" N\");\n    }\n\n    public static double calculateGravitationalForce(double m1, double m2, double r) {\n        double G = 6.67430e-11; // Gravitational constant\n        return G * ((m1 * m2) / (r * r));\n    }\n\n    public static double calculateElectromagneticForce(double q1, double q2, double r) {\n        double k = 8.98755e9; // Coulomb's constant\n        return k * ((q1 * q2) / (r * r));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n- The `calculateGravitationalForce` method computes the gravitational force between two masses using Newton's law of universal gravitation.\n- The `calculateElectromagneticForce` method computes the electromagnetic force between two charges using Coulomb's law.\n- The example uses approximate values for Earth and Moon to demonstrate gravitational force and hypothetical charges for electromagnetic force.\n\nThis code provides a basic framework for understanding how gravitational and electromagnetic forces can be calculated in a program. For complex simulations, such as those involving nuclear forces, more sophisticated models and computational power are required."
