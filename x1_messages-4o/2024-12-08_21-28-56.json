        "content": "To retrieve information on the availability and pricing of red roses, white lilies, and crystal vases with silver accents from a SQL database, you would need to have a database structure that includes tables for flowers and vases, with columns for the relevant attributes such as type, availability, and price. Below is an example of how you might structure your SQL queries to achieve this:\n\n### Assumptions:\n\n1. **Flowers Table**: Includes columns such as `id`, `name`, `color`, `availability`, and `price`.\n2. **Vases Table**: Includes columns such as `id`, `name`, `feature`, `availability`, and `price`.\n\n### SQL Queries:\n\n1. **Retrieve Red Roses and White Lilies:**\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT name, color, availability, price\n   FROM Flowers\n   WHERE (name = 'Rose' AND color = 'Red') OR (name = 'Lily' AND color = 'White')\n   ORDER BY availability DESC, price ASC;\n   ```\n\n   This query selects red roses and white lilies from the `Flowers` table, sorting them first by availability (from most to least available) and then by price (from lowest to highest).\n\n2. **Retrieve Crystal Vases with Silver Accents:**\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT name, feature, availability, price\n   FROM Vases\n   WHERE feature LIKE '%Crystal%' AND feature LIKE '%Silver%'\n   ORDER BY availability DESC, price ASC;\n   ```\n\n   This query selects vases with both crystal and silver features, sorting them by availability and price similarly to the flowers.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`SELECT`**: Specifies the columns you want to retrieve.\n- **`FROM`**: Specifies the table you want to query.\n- **`WHERE`**: Filters the rows based on specified conditions.\n- **`LIKE`**: Used for pattern matching with wildcards (`%` matches any sequence of characters).\n- **`ORDER BY`**: Sorts the result set according to specified columns. `DESC` for descending order and `ASC` for ascending order.\n\n### Considerations for an Intimate Candlelit Dinner:\n\n- **Availability**: Ensures that you choose items that are readily available.\n- **Price**: Helps you stay within budget by choosing the most cost-effective options.\n\nBy executing these queries, you can effectively gather and sort the information needed to make the best choices for your dinner setting."
