According to the documentation, `AxesStack` is a callable where `ax_stack()` returns the current axes. However, when I call `fig.ax_stack()`, I receive an error message that says `AttributeError: 'Figure' object has no attribute 'ax_stack'`. How can I properly get a list of axes for a figure in pyplot?"

        "content": "To get a list of axes for a figure in Matplotlib, you should use the `axes` attribute of the `Figure` object, rather than trying to directly use `AxesStack`.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Create a figure and some axes\nfig, ax1 = plt.subplots()\nax2 = fig.add_subplot(111)\n\n# Get the list of axes in the figure\naxes_list = fig.axes\n\n# Print the list of axes\nprint(axes_list)\n```\n\nIn this example, `fig` is a `Figure` object, and `fig.axes` returns a list of all `Axes` objects contained within the figure. This is the recommended way to access the axes in a figure using Matplotlib. The `AxesStack` class is an internal component and is not typically used directly for accessing axes in a figure."
