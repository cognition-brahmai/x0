Specifically, I am trying to extend the 'Place' model to create a 'LongNamedRestaurant' model where I want to override the 'name' attribute to have a longer length. Here is my code:\n\n```python\nclass Place(models.Model):\n   name = models.CharField(max_length=20)\n   rating = models.DecimalField()\n\nclass LongNamedRestaurant(Place):  # Subclassing `Place`.\n   name = models.CharField(max_length=255)  # Notice, I'm overriding `Place.name` to give it a longer length.\n   food_type = models.CharField(max_length=25)\n```\n\nI'm looking to use the version mentioned here: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/models/#id7. If this is not supported, is there any workaround to achieve similar results?"

        "content": "In Django, when you inherit from a parent model, you can't directly override the attributes of the parent model, such as changing the `max_length` of a `CharField`. This is because Django's ORM relies on the database schema, which is defined by the parent model, and you can't have two different definitions for the same column in the same table.\n\nHowever, there are a couple of ways to work around this limitation:\n\n### Option 1: Use a One-to-One Link\n\nInstead of using model inheritance, you can create a separate model that extends the original model using a one-to-one relationship. This way, you effectively create a new table with its own schema.\n\n```python\nclass Place(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=20)\n    rating = models.DecimalField()\n\nclass LongNamedRestaurant(models.Model):\n    place = models.OneToOneField(Place, on_delete=models.CASCADE, primary_key=True)\n    long_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)  # New field for longer name\n    food_type = models.CharField(max_length=25)\n```\n\nIn this setup, `LongNamedRestaurant` has its own table, and you can store a longer name in the `long_name` field.\n\n### Option 2: Use Multi-table Inheritance\n\nIf you want to stick with inheritance, Django\u2019s multi-table inheritance can be used. This approach creates a separate table for each model.\n\n```python\nclass Place(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=20)\n    rating = models.DecimalField()\n\nclass LongNamedRestaurant(Place):\n    long_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)  # Use a different field name\n    food_type = models.CharField(max_length=25)\n```\n\nHere, `LongNamedRestaurant` will have its own table, and you can use the `long_name` field instead of `name`.\n\n### Option 3: Use Custom Save Method\n\nIf you need to adapt the length of the name dynamically, you can override the `save` method to handle conditions based on the length of the name.\n\n```python\nclass Place(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=20)\n    rating = models.DecimalField()\n\nclass LongNamedRestaurant(Place):\n    food_type = models.CharField(max_length=25)\n\n    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        if len(self.name) > 20:\n            raise ValueError(\"Name is too long for the Place model.\")\n        super().save(*args, **kwargs)\n```\n\nThis approach doesn't change the database schema but adds a logic constraint in the code.\n\nChoose the option that best suits your project's requirements. Each has its own pros and cons, depending on how tightly you want to couple the models and how you plan to manage the database schema."
