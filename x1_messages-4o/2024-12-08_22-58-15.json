The resulting sentence should be semantically equivalent to the original sentence, but the level of linguistic complexity should be increased. \nFor example, if the original sentence is \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog,\" the resulting sentence would be \"Eht kciuq nworb xof spmuj revo eht yzal god.\""

        "content": "Certainly! Below is a Ruby code snippet that achieves the task of reversing the order of letters in each word of a given sentence while preserving the original word order:\n\n```ruby\ndef reverse_letters_in_words(sentence)\n  # Split the sentence into words\n  words = sentence.split(' ')\n  \n  # Reverse each word's letters\n  reversed_words = words.map do |word|\n    word.reverse\n  end\n  \n  # Join the reversed words back into a sentence\n  reversed_sentence = reversed_words.join(' ')\n  \n  reversed_sentence\nend\n\n# Example usage\noriginal_sentence = \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\nresulting_sentence = reverse_letters_in_words(original_sentence)\n\nputs resulting_sentence\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Splitting the Sentence**: The sentence is split into individual words using the `split(' ')` method, which creates an array of words.\n\n2. **Reversing Each Word**: The `map` method is used to iterate over each word in the array. The `reverse` method is called on each word to reverse the order of its letters.\n\n3. **Joining the Words**: The reversed words are then joined back into a single string using `join(' ')`, with spaces in between to form a coherent sentence.\n\n4. **Output**: The resulting sentence is printed, which is semantically equivalent to the original sentence but with increased linguistic complexity through reversed letters.\n\nBy running this Ruby code with the example sentence, you should obtain the desired output: \"Eht kciuq nworb xof spmuj revo eht yzal god.\""
