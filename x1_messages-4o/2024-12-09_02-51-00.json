        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the way you're trying to call the `getPumps` method. In Python, when you define a method within a class, the first parameter is typically `self`, which refers to the instance of the class. This means that you need to call the method on an instance of the class, not the class itself, unless you define it as a class method or a static method.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can fix it:\n\n1. **Create an instance of the class** and then call the method on that instance:\n\n```python\nclass Pump:\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        print(\"init\")  # this will print\n\n    def getPumps(self):\n        # Open database connection\n        # some stuff here\n        print(\"getPumps called\")\n        return \"Pump data\"  # return some dummy data for demonstration\n\n# Create an instance of the Pump class\npump_instance = Pump()\n\n# Call the getPumps method on the instance\np = pump_instance.getPumps()\n\nprint(p)\n```\n\n2. **Alternatively**, if you want to call `getPumps` without creating an instance, you can define it as a `@staticmethod` or `@classmethod`. However, you would need to modify how the method works, as it wouldn\u2019t have access to instance-specific data.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can define it as a static method:\n\n```python\nclass Pump:\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        print(\"init\")  # never prints if we use static method without instance\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def getPumps():\n        # Open database connection\n        # some stuff here\n        print(\"getPumps called\")\n        return \"Pump data\"  # return some dummy data for demonstration\n\n# Call the getPumps method on the class itself\np = Pump.getPumps()\n\nprint(p)\n```\n\nChoose the approach that fits your use case best. If `getPumps` needs to work with the instance (like accessing instance variables), use the first approach. If it can be a utility function that doesn\u2019t rely on instance data, the second approach might be suitable."
