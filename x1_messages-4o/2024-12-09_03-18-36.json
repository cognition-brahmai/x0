        "content": "It looks like there are a couple of issues that need to be addressed in order to resolve the compilation problem with your CUDA project.\n\n### Issue 1: GCC Version Compatibility\n\nThe error message you initially received indicates that CUDA 5.0 does not support gcc versions higher than 4.6. You've correctly pointed gcc to version 4.6 by creating a symbolic link in the CUDA bin directory. However, there might be another step needed to ensure that all components of the build process are using the correct version.\n\n### Issue 2: `cc1plus` Error\n\nThe error `gcc: error trying to exec 'cc1plus': execvp: No such file or directory` suggests that the C++ compiler component (which is part of the GCC toolchain) is missing or not found. This usually occurs when the g++ package (the GCC C++ compiler) is not installed or not properly configured.\n\n### Steps to Resolve the Issues\n\n1. **Install the Correct GCC and G++ Versions:**\n\n   Ensure that both gcc and g++ version 4.6 are installed. You can check this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install gcc-4.6 g++-4.6\n   ```\n\n2. **Set the Default GCC and G++ Versions:**\n\n   You may need to explicitly set the default gcc and g++ versions for your system using the `update-alternatives` tool:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.6 60\n   sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.6 60\n\n   sudo update-alternatives --config gcc\n   sudo update-alternatives --config g++\n   ```\n\n   Follow the prompts to select gcc-4.6 and g++-4.6.\n\n3. **Verify the Installation:**\n\n   After setting the default versions, verify the versions being used:\n\n   ```bash\n   gcc --version\n   g++ --version\n   ```\n\n   Ensure that both commands return version 4.6.\n\n4. **Recompile Your Project:**\n\n   Once you've confirmed that the correct versions are set, try recompiling your CUDA project. Make sure to clean any previous build artifacts to avoid conflicts:\n\n   ```bash\n   make clean\n   make all\n   ```\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n\n   - Make sure your `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables are correctly set to include the CUDA toolkit directories.\n   - If you're using an IDE or a build system, ensure that it's configured to use the correct gcc and g++ versions.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the compilation issues and successfully build your CUDA project. If you continue to experience problems, it may help to look into any specific configuration or environment settings that could be interfering with the build process."
