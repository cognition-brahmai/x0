I've been able to achieve this using a Python list comprehension, as shown below:\n\n```python\nsum([1 for x in frequencies if x > 0])\n```\n\nHowever, I'm not completely satisfied with this solution as the '1' seems like a 'magic number'. Could there be a more Pythonic way to solve this problem?"

        "content": "Certainly! Your current solution is quite effective, but if you're looking to avoid the 'magic number' and make the code more Pythonic, you can use the `sum` function directly with a generator expression, which eliminates the need for a list and avoids the explicit '1'. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\ncount = sum(1 for x in frequencies if x > 0)\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `filter` function along with `len` to achieve the same result, which some might find more readable:\n\n```python\ncount = len(list(filter(lambda x: x > 0, frequencies)))\n```\n\nBoth of these methods are idiomatic in Python and avoid the use of a 'magic number' while achieving the desired result."
