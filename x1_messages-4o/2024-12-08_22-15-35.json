        "content": "To replace specific parts of a sentence in PHP, you can use string replacement functions like `str_replace()` or regular expressions with `preg_replace()`. In your case, since you're replacing the subject and the object with specific terms, `str_replace()` should suffice if the words are straightforward and unique. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```php\n<?php\nfunction replaceWords($sentence, $subjectReplacement, $objectReplacement) {\n    // Replace the subject \"Her\" with a possessive pronoun, e.g., \"My\"\n    $sentence = str_replace(\"Her\", $subjectReplacement, $sentence);\n\n    // Replace the object \"Lamborghini\" with a specific make, e.g., \"Aventador\"\n    $sentence = str_replace(\"Lamborghini\", $objectReplacement, $sentence);\n\n    return $sentence;\n}\n\n$originalSentence = \"Her Lamborghini is parked in the garage\";\n$subjectReplacement = \"My\"; // Example of a possessive pronoun\n$objectReplacement = \"Aventador\"; // Specific make\n\n$newSentence = replaceWords($originalSentence, $subjectReplacement, $objectReplacement);\necho $newSentence;\n?>\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- The `replaceWords` function takes three parameters: the original sentence, the replacement for the subject, and the replacement for the object.\n- It uses `str_replace()` to replace \"Her\" with the desired possessive pronoun and \"Lamborghini\" with the specific make like \"Aventador\".\n- Finally, it returns the modified sentence.\n\nWhen you run this script, it will output:\n\n```\nMy Aventador is parked in the garage\n```\n\nThis approach works well when the words to be replaced are distinct and do not appear elsewhere in the sentence. If the sentence structure is more complex, you might need to use regular expressions to identify specific parts of speech more accurately."
