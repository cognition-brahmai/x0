        "content": "To find the two smallest numbers in an array, you can follow these steps in most programming languages:\n\n1. **Initialize two variables:** Start by setting two variables to hold the smallest and the second smallest numbers. You can initialize them to a very large value or the first two elements of the array if you are sure the array has at least two elements.\n\n2. **Iterate through the array:** Go through each number in the array and update the two variables accordingly.\n\nHere's a simple implementation in Python:\n\n```python\ndef find_two_smallest_numbers(arr):\n    if len(arr) < 2:\n        raise ValueError(\"Array should have at least two elements\")\n\n    # Initialize the smallest and second smallest variables\n    smallest = float('inf')\n    second_smallest = float('inf')\n\n    for num in arr:\n        if num < smallest:\n            # Update second smallest before updating smallest\n            second_smallest = smallest\n            smallest = num\n        elif num < second_smallest and num != smallest:\n            second_smallest = num\n\n    return smallest, second_smallest\n\n# Example usage\narray = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]\nsmallest, second_smallest = find_two_smallest_numbers(array)\nprint(f\"The two smallest numbers are: {smallest} and {second_smallest}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Initialization:** We use `float('inf')` to ensure any number in the array will be smaller initially.\n- **Iteration:** For each number in the array, check if it's smaller than the current smallest. If it is, update the second smallest to the current smallest, and then update the smallest to this number.\n- **Check for second smallest:** If a number is not smaller than the smallest but is smaller than the second smallest, update the second smallest.\n\nThis approach ensures that you find the two smallest numbers in one pass through the array, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n)."
