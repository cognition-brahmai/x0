        "content": "To find the maximum area of a triangular plot of land with sides 5, 10, and 12 units, we can use Heron's formula, which is suitable for determining the area of a triangle when its sides are known.\n\nFirst, calculate the semi-perimeter \\( s \\) of the triangle:\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{5 + 10 + 12}{2} = 13.5\n\\]\n\nNext, use Heron's formula to find the area \\( A \\):\n\n\\[\nA = \\sqrt{s \\times (s - a) \\times (s - b) \\times (s - c)}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( a = 5 \\), \\( b = 10 \\), and \\( c = 12 \\).\n\n\\[\nA = \\sqrt{13.5 \\times (13.5 - 5) \\times (13.5 - 10) \\times (13.5 - 12)}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nA = \\sqrt{13.5 \\times 8.5 \\times 3.5 \\times 1.5}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the result:\n\n\\[\nA = \\sqrt{13.5 \\times 8.5 \\times 3.5 \\times 1.5} \\approx \\sqrt{601.875}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nA \\approx 24.53 \\text{ square units}\n\\]\n\nThus, the maximum area of land that you can grow crops on within this triangular plot is approximately \\( 24.53 \\) square units."
