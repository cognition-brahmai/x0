Here's how you can rewrite your function definition:\n\n```python\ndef my_function(\n    argument_one,\n    argument_two,\n    argument_three,\n    argument_four,\n    argument_five\n):\n```\n\nThis approach enhances readability and ensures that your code adheres to the PEP8 guideline of limiting lines to a maximum of 79 characters. By aligning the arguments vertically, it becomes easier to read and maintain the function definition."
