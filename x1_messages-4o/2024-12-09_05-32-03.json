Here's a simple way to achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Get the current datetime\ncurrent_datetime = datetime.now()\n\n# Round down to the previous hour\nrounded_down_datetime = current_datetime.replace(minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)\n\nprint(\"Current datetime:\", current_datetime)\nprint(\"Rounded down to previous hour:\", rounded_down_datetime)\n```\n\nThis code snippet captures the current datetime and then uses the `replace()` method to set the minutes, seconds, and microseconds to zero, effectively rounding the time down to the start of the current hour. If you have a specific datetime, you can replace `datetime.now()` with your datetime object."
