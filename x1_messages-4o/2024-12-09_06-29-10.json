I want to install libraries like torch or tensorflow into pyenv python 2.7.14, but not into the system default python. Also, how can I change the pip3 version? When I use 'which pip' and 'which pip3', I get the following outputs:\n\n```\nhaos-mbp:~ hao$ which pip\n/Users/hao/.pyenv/shims/pip\nhaos-mbp:~ hao$ which pip3\n/usr/local/bin/pip3\n```"

        "content": "To manage different Python versions and their associated packages using `pyenv`, you can follow these steps to ensure that you're using the correct `pip` and `pip3` associated with your pyenv Python version. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Your Python Version with Pyenv\n\n1. **Install Python 2.7.14 with Pyenv:**\n\n   You've already installed Python 2.7.14, but if you need to do it again, you can use:\n\n   ```bash\n   pyenv install 2.7.14\n   ```\n\n2. **Set the Local or Global Python Version:**\n\n   You can set the Python version globally or for a specific project directory.\n\n   - **Globally:**\n\n     ```bash\n     pyenv global 2.7.14\n     ```\n\n   - **Locally (within a project directory):**\n\n     Navigate to your project directory and run:\n\n     ```bash\n     pyenv local 2.7.14\n     ```\n\n3. **Verify the Python Version:**\n\n   Ensure that the correct Python version is being used:\n\n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   ```\n\n### Step 2: Use the Correct Pip Version\n\n1. **Ensure You're Using Pyenv's Pip:**\n\n   When you use `pyenv`, it should automatically switch to the correct `pip` associated with the current Python version set by pyenv. To check which pip is being used:\n\n   ```bash\n   which pip\n   ```\n\n   Make sure it points to `/Users/hao/.pyenv/shims/pip`.\n\n2. **Use Pip to Install Packages:**\n\n   You can now use `pip` to install packages like `torch` or `tensorflow` into your Python 2.7.14 environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install torch\n   pip install tensorflow\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Change the Pip3 Version if Needed\n\nIf you wish to use `pip3` for Python 3 installations or need to ensure it points to the correct version, you can manage Python 3 versions with pyenv as well.\n\n1. **Install a Python 3 Version with Pyenv:**\n\n   For example, if you want Python 3.8.6:\n\n   ```bash\n   pyenv install 3.8.6\n   ```\n\n2. **Set the Python 3 Version:**\n\n   Similar to Python 2, set it globally or locally:\n\n   ```bash\n   pyenv global 3.8.6\n   ```\n\n3. **Use Pyenv's Pip3:**\n\n   Ensure you have the right `pip3`:\n\n   ```bash\n   which pip3\n   ```\n\n   If it's not pointing to the pyenv shim, you might need to adjust your PATH or ensure the pyenv shims directory is prioritized.\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- **Rehash after Installation:** Whenever you install a new Python version or change versions, run:\n\n  ```bash\n  pyenv rehash\n  ```\n\n- **Ensure Proper Shell Configuration:** Make sure your shell configuration (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.) includes pyenv initialization:\n\n  ```bash\n  eval \"$(pyenv init --path)\"\n  eval \"$(pyenv init -)\"\n  ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to manage different Python environments and their associated packages on your Mac using pyenv."
