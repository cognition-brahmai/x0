I'm not looking for frequencies of each distinct word, but the total number of words. I tried using the split function on the DataFrame column 'col' and then counting the number of words using len function, but I ended up getting 'AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'split''. I also attempted to use a lambda function to split the column and count the words, but this resulted in 'AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'split''. Here are the codes I tried:\n\n```python\nwords = df['col'].split()\ndf['totalwords'] = len(words)\n```\nThis resulted in 'AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'split''.\n\n```python\nf = lambda x: len(x[\"col\"].split()) -1\ndf['totalwords'] = df.apply(f, axis=1)\n```\nThis resulted in 'AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'split', 'occurred at index 0''."

        "content": "To count the number of words in each entry of a DataFrame column, you can make use of the `apply` method along with a lambda function. The error you're encountering seems to be due to how you're applying the split method on the Series object instead of individual strings within the Series.\n\nHere's a corrected version of your approach:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {'col': ['This is a sentence', 'Another sentence', 'More words here']}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Define a function to count words\ncount_words = lambda x: len(x.split())\n\n# Apply the function to each row in the 'col' column\ndf['totalwords'] = df['col'].apply(count_words)\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `apply(count_words)`: This applies the `count_words` function to each element in the 'col' column.\n- `x.split()`: Splits each string into a list of words.\n- `len(x.split())`: Counts the number of words in the list.\n\nWith this approach, each string in the column 'col' is split into its constituent words, and the length of this list gives the total number of words in that particular entry. This should resolve the errors you encountered and correctly populate the 'totalwords' column with word counts for each row."
