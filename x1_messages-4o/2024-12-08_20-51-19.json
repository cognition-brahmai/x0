Calculate \\( 7 \\% 3 \\) (modulus operation, remainder of 7 divided by 3):\n   \\[ 7 \\% 3 = 1 \\]\n\n2. Calculate \\( 8^2 \\) (exponentiation):\n   \\[ 8^2 = 64 \\]\n\n3. Calculate \\( 9 \\times 5 \\) (multiplication):\n   \\[ 9 \\times 5 = 45 \\]\n\nNow substitute these results back into the expression:\n\n\\[ 1 + 64 - 45 \\]\n\n4. Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n   \\[ 1 + 64 = 65 \\]\n   \\[ 65 - 45 = 20 \\]\n\nSo, the result of the expression is \\( 20 \\)."
