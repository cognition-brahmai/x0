Only the creator can access a compute instance.

        "content": "In Azure Machine Learning, compute instances are designed to be personal workspaces, and by default, each compute instance is tied to the user who created it. This means that only the creator of the compute instance has access to it. As of now, Azure does not support sharing compute instances between users directly. This is why you\u2019re encountering the error message when trying to access the compute instance with user2.\n\nHowever, there are a few workarounds you can consider:\n\n1. **Create Separate Compute Instances**: Each user can create their own compute instance. This ensures that resources are isolated and each user has their own environment.\n\n2. **Use Compute Clusters for Shared Workloads**: If you want to share resources, consider using a compute cluster. Compute clusters can be used to run training jobs and can be accessed by multiple users within the workspace.\n\n3. **Collaborate via Shared Notebooks**: You can share your work by exporting notebooks and sharing them through a shared storage service or a version control system like Git.\n\n4. **Assign Roles and Permissions**: Double-check that both users have the necessary roles and permissions in the Azure Machine Learning workspace and that there are no policies restricting access.\n\n5. **Azure Active Directory (AAD) Integration**: Ensure that both users are properly set up in Azure Active Directory, and check if there are any additional AAD-based access controls in place.\n\nRemember, the design of compute instances is such that they are personal and meant for individual use, primarily for development and testing purposes."
