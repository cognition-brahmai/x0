According to a guide I found on the NVIDIA website, I need to force the X display onto a single GPU using the BusID parameter in the \"Display\" section of the xorg.conf file and deleting any other \"Display\" sections. I have tried to modify the \"Display\" subsection with the correct BusID but it doesn't seem to work. Is there another way to achieve this?\n\nMy xorg.conf file currently looks like this:\n\n```\n# nvidia-xconfig: X configuration file generated by nvidia-xconfig\n# nvidia-xconfig:  version 304.64  (buildmeister@swio-display-x86-rhel47-12)  Tue Oct 30 12:04:46 PDT 2012\n\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Identifier     \"Layout0\"\n    Screen      0  \"Screen0\"\n    InputDevice    \"Keyboard0\" \"CoreKeyboard\"\n    InputDevice    \"Mouse0\" \"CorePointer\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Files\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n    # generated from default\n    Identifier     \"Mouse0\"\n    Driver         \"mouse\"\n    Option         \"Protocol\" \"auto\"\n    Option         \"Device\" \"/dev/psaux\"\n    Option         \"Emulate3Buttons\" \"no\"\n    Option         \"ZAxisMapping\" \"4 5\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n    # generated from default\n    Identifier     \"Keyboard0\"\n    Driver         \"kbd\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier     \"Monitor0\"\n    VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n    ModelName      \"Unknown\"\n    HorizSync       28.0 - 33.0\n    VertRefresh     43.0 - 72.0\n    Option         \"DPMS\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device0\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen0\"\n    Device         \"Device0\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor0\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n```"

        "content": "To force the X server to run on a specific GPU using the `BusID` parameter, you'll need to ensure that the `Device` section in your `xorg.conf` is properly configured. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do that:\n\n1. **Identify the BusID of the GPU**: First, you'll need to find the BusID of the GPU you want to use. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   lspci | grep -i nvidia\n   ```\n\n   This will list the NVIDIA GPUs in your system along with their BusIDs. The BusID is typically in the format `PCI:0:2:0`.\n\n2. **Modify the xorg.conf file**: Once you have the BusID, you'll need to add it to the `Device` section of your `xorg.conf` file. Here's an example of how it should look:\n\n   ```ini\n   Section \"Device\"\n       Identifier     \"Device0\"\n       Driver         \"nvidia\"\n       VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n       BusID          \"PCI:1:0:0\"  # Replace this with the correct BusID\n   EndSection\n   ```\n\n3. **Remove any conflicting configurations**: Ensure that there are no other `Device` sections for NVIDIA GPUs in your `xorg.conf` file. If there are, remove or comment them out to prevent conflicts.\n\n4. **Restart the X server**: After making these changes, you'll need to restart your X server for the changes to take effect. This can typically be done by rebooting your system or restarting your display manager (e.g., `sudo systemctl restart gdm` for GNOME).\n\n5. **Verify the configuration**: After restarting, you can verify that the correct GPU is being used by checking the X server logs or using a tool like `nvidia-smi`.\n\nIf you're still having issues, ensure that your NVIDIA drivers are up-to-date and that there are no other configuration files overriding your `xorg.conf` settings. Additionally, check for any relevant messages in the X server log files located in `/var/log/` (e.g., `/var/log/Xorg.0.log`) for more insight into any potential issues."
