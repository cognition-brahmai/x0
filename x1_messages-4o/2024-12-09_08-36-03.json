I am using CutMix or MixUp type augmentation and this is how I create the label for two labels:\n\n```python\nlabel = label_one*beta + (1-beta)*label_two\n```\nHowever, I need to do this for more than two images. In YoLo4, Mosaic Augmentation is used for object detection problems and it creates augmented samples with 4 images. How can I do this for image classification cases?\n\nHere is a starter code for the problem:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \nimport random\n\n(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = \\\ntf.keras.datasets.cifar10.load_data()\ntrain_images = train_images[:10,:,:]\ntrain_labels = train_labels[:10]\ntrain_images.shape, train_labels.shape\n\n((10, 32, 32, 3), (10, 1))\n```\nAnd here is the function I've written for this augmentation:\n\n```python\ndef mosaicmix(image, label, DIM, minfrac=0.25, maxfrac=0.75):\n    '''image, label: batches of samples \n    '''\n    xc, yc  = np.random.randint(DIM * minfrac, DIM * maxfrac, (2,))\n    indices = np.random.permutation(int(image.shape[0]))\n    mosaic_image = np.zeros((DIM, DIM, 3), dtype=np.float32)\n    final_imgs, final_lbs = [], []\n\n    # Iterate over the full indices \n    for j in range(len(indices)): \n        # Take 4 sample for to create a mosaic sample randomly \n        rand4indices = [j] + random.sample(list(indices), 3) \n        \n        # Make mosaic with 4 samples \n        for i in range(len(rand4indices)):\n            if i == 0:    # top left\n                x1a, y1a, x2a, y2a =  0,  0, xc, yc\n                x1b, y1b, x2b, y2b = DIM - xc, DIM - yc, DIM, DIM # from bottom right        \n            elif i == 1:  # top right\n                x1a, y1a, x2a, y2a = xc, 0, DIM , yc\n                x1b, y1b, x2b, y2b = 0, DIM - yc, DIM - xc, DIM # from bottom left\n            elif i == 2:  # bottom left\n                x1a, y1a, x2a, y2a = 0, yc, xc, DIM\n                x1b, y1b, x2b, y2b = DIM - xc, 0, DIM, DIM-yc   # from top right\n            elif i == 3:  # bottom right\n                x1a, y1a, x2a, y2a = xc, yc,  DIM, DIM\n                x1b, y1b, x2b, y2b = 0, 0, DIM-xc, DIM-yc    # from top left\n                \n            # Copy-Paste\n            mosaic_image[y1a:y2a, x1a:x2a] = image[i,][y1b:y2b, x1b:x2b]\n\n        # Append the Mosiac samples\n        final_imgs.append(mosaic_image)\n        \n    return final_imgs, label\n```\n\nThe augmented samples are currently with the wrong labels."

        "content": "To properly handle labels for a mosaic augmentation involving more than two images, you need to adopt a strategy that correctly integrates the labels from all contributing images. The goal is to create a composite label that reflects the contributions of each image in the mosaic. Here's a step-by-step process to achieve this:\n\n1. **Understanding the Contribution**: Each image contributes a portion of the final mosaic image. You need to determine these portions for each image and use them to weight the labels accordingly.\n\n2. **Setting Up Proportions**: Depending on how you divide your mosaic (e.g., into quadrants), you can decide on the size of each segment and its corresponding weight.\n\n3. **Composite Label Computation**: Use the determined proportions to compute the final label using a weighted sum.\n\nLet's modify your function to include label computation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport random\n\ndef mosaicmix(image_batch, label_batch, DIM, minfrac=0.25, maxfrac=0.75):\n    '''image_batch, label_batch: batches of samples \n    '''\n    batch_size = image_batch.shape[0]\n    final_imgs, final_lbs = [], []\n\n    # Iterate over the full batch\n    for j in range(batch_size):\n        # Generate random coordinates for cut\n        xc, yc = np.random.randint(DIM * minfrac, DIM * maxfrac, (2,))\n        indices = np.random.permutation(batch_size)\n        rand4indices = [indices[0]] + random.sample(list(indices[1:]), 3)\n        \n        mosaic_image = np.zeros((DIM, DIM, 3), dtype=np.float32)\n        mosaic_label = np.zeros_like(label_batch[0], dtype=np.float32)\n        \n        for i, idx in enumerate(rand4indices):\n            if i == 0:    # top left\n                x1a, y1a, x2a, y2a =  0,  0, xc, yc\n                x1b, y1b, x2b, y2b = DIM - xc, DIM - yc, DIM, DIM # from bottom right        \n            elif i == 1:  # top right\n                x1a, y1a, x2a, y2a = xc, 0, DIM , yc\n                x1b, y1b, x2b, y2b = 0, DIM - yc, DIM - xc, DIM # from bottom left\n            elif i == 2:  # bottom left\n                x1a, y1a, x2a, y2a = 0, yc, xc, DIM\n                x1b, y1b, x2b, y2b = DIM - xc, 0, DIM, DIM-yc   # from top right\n            elif i == 3:  # bottom right\n                x1a, y1a, x2a, y2a = xc, yc,  DIM, DIM\n                x1b, y1b, x2b, y2b = 0, 0, DIM-xc, DIM-yc    # from top left\n                \n            # Copy-Paste\n            mosaic_image[y1a:y2a, x1a:x2a] = image_batch[idx][y1b:y2b, x1b:x2b]\n            \n            # Calculate the contribution of each image to the mosaic\n            area = (x2a - x1a) * (y2a - y1a)\n            total_area = DIM * DIM\n            weight = area / total_area\n            \n            # Weighted label\n            mosaic_label += label_batch[idx] * weight\n        \n        # Append the Mosiac samples\n        final_imgs.append(mosaic_image)\n        final_lbs.append(mosaic_label)\n        \n    return np.array(final_imgs), np.array(final_lbs)\n\n\n# Example usage\nDIM = 32\ntrain_images = train_images[:10,:,:]\ntrain_labels = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(train_labels[:10], num_classes=10)\n\nmosaic_images, mosaic_labels = mosaicmix(train_images, train_labels, DIM)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Random Indices**: We randomly select four different images from the batch to form the mosaic.\n- **Image Placement**: Each of the four images is placed in one of the quadrants of the mosaic image.\n- **Label Weighting**: The label for each quadrant is weighted by the proportion of the total image area it occupies. This ensures that larger contributions to the mosaic have a larger influence on the final label.\n- **Composite Labels**: The final label for the mosaic is a weighted sum of the labels of the individual images.\n\nThis approach will ensure that the labels accurately reflect the contributions of each image to the mosaic, providing better supervision during training."
