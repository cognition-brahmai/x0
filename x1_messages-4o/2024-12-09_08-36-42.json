Here's a step-by-step guide to ensure you have the correct setup:\n\n1. **Install the latest version of albumentations**: First, make sure you have the latest version of the `albumentations` library installed. You can do this by running the following command:\n\n   ```python\n   !pip install -U albumentations\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify installation of PyTorch and Albumentations**: Make sure that PyTorch is installed as it's required for `albumentations.pytorch`.\n\n   ```python\n   import torch\n   import albumentations\n   ```\n\n3. **Import ToTensorV2**: Now try importing `ToTensorV2` again:\n\n   ```python\n   from albumentations.pytorch import ToTensorV2\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for errors**: If you encounter any errors during the import, make sure they are related to the package version or compatibility issues. If the error persists, try restarting your Colab runtime and running the cells again from the beginning.\n\n5. **Verify the version of albumentations**: You can also verify the version of `albumentations` to ensure it's up to date:\n\n   ```python\n   import albumentations\n   print(albumentations.__version__)\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully import `ToTensorV2` in your Google Colab environment. If you still face issues, feel free to provide more details about the error message for further assistance."
