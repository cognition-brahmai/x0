For instance, if I have the following classes set up:\n\n```python\nclass Foo:\n     def __init__(self, frob, frotz):\n          self.frobnicate = frob\n          self.frotz = frotz\nclass Bar:\n     def __init__(self, frob, frizzle):\n          self.frobnicate = frob\n          self.frotz = 34\n          self.frazzle = frizzle\n```\n\nHow can I use the super() function in this context to eliminate the duplicate code?"

        "content": "To use the `super()` function to eliminate duplicate code in the context of single inheritance, you first need to establish a parent-child relationship between the two classes. In your example, it seems like `Bar` could inherit from `Foo`. This way, you can use `super()` to call the `__init__` method of the parent class (`Foo`) from the child class (`Bar`), which allows you to reuse the initialization logic for the common attributes. Here\u2019s how you could rewrite your classes to achieve this:\n\n```python\nclass Foo:\n    def __init__(self, frob, frotz):\n        self.frobnicate = frob\n        self.frotz = frotz\n\nclass Bar(Foo):\n    def __init__(self, frob, frizzle):\n        # Call the constructor of Foo using super()\n        super().__init__(frob, 34)  # Use 34 directly if it's a constant value\n        self.frazzle = frizzle\n\n# Example usage\nfoo_instance = Foo(10, 20)\nprint(f\"Foo: frobnicate = {foo_instance.frobnicate}, frotz = {foo_instance.frotz}\")\n\nbar_instance = Bar(30, 'example')\nprint(f\"Bar: frobnicate = {bar_instance.frobnicate}, frotz = {bar_instance.frotz}, frazzle = {bar_instance.frazzle}\")\n```\n\nIn this revised example:\n\n- `Bar` is a subclass of `Foo`.\n- The `__init__` method of `Bar` calls the `__init__` method of `Foo` using `super()`, passing the necessary arguments.\n- This eliminates the need to duplicate the code for setting `self.frobnicate` and `self.frotz` in the `Bar` class, leveraging inheritance to handle the common attributes and behavior."
