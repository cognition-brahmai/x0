Additionally, how can I limit the number of decimal places displayed to a maximum of four, and leave them blank if there isn't any data? In C#, this can be achieved with something like \"floatValue.ToString(\"0.0###\")\", where the # symbols represent a place that can be left blank. \n\nFor example:\n\nInput: 0\nOutput: 0.0\n\nInput: 65.53\nOutput: 65.53\n\nInput: 40.355435\nOutput: 40.3554\n\nI'm aware that I can use {0.4f} to print up to four decimal places, but it pads with unwanted 0s. How can I achieve this in Python?"

        "content": "In Python, you can achieve this formatting by using the `format` function with a custom format specifier. You can leverage the `Decimal` type from the `decimal` module to handle this specific formatting need. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom decimal import Decimal, ROUND_DOWN\n\ndef format_float(value):\n    # Convert the float to a Decimal to avoid floating point precision issues\n    decimal_value = Decimal(str(value))\n    \n    # Quantize to 4 decimal places, rounding down\n    formatted_value = decimal_value.quantize(Decimal('1.0000'), rounding=ROUND_DOWN)\n    \n    # Format the number, stripping unnecessary trailing zeros\n    return '{:f}'.format(formatted_value).rstrip('0').rstrip('.')\n\n# Examples\nprint(format_float(0))        # Output: 0.0\nprint(format_float(65.53))    # Output: 65.53\nprint(format_float(40.355435))  # Output: 40.3554\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Decimal Conversion**: By converting the float to a `Decimal`, you avoid the precision issues that can arise with floating-point arithmetic.\n\n2. **Quantize**: The `quantize` method is used to specify the number of decimal places, in this case, up to four. The `ROUND_DOWN` option ensures that the number is not rounded up, and instead, it is simply truncated to four decimal places.\n\n3. **String Formatting**: The formatted value is then converted to a string with `'{:f}'.format(...)`, which formats the number as a fixed-point number. The `rstrip('0').rstrip('.')` part removes any trailing zeros and the decimal point if it's not necessary, ensuring that the output is as desired.\n\nThis approach provides the flexibility to format the floating-point number as required, similar to the formatting capabilities in C#."
