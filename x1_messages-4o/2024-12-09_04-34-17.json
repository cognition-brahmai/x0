The error seems to be related to Django version > 1.8.3. How can I resolve this issue?"

    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"save() prohibited to prevent data loss due to unsaved related object,\" typically occurs when you're trying to save a related object without properly associating it with a saved instance of the parent model. In your case, it seems like you're trying to save the `hourformset` with a reference to a `company` that hasn't been saved yet.\n\nHere's how you can handle this situation:\n\n1. **Ensure `my_id` is correctly capturing the primary key**: After saving the `model_instance`, make sure you're indeed retrieving the primary key.\n\n2. **Save the parent instance before the related objects**: You've already done this by saving `model_instance` first.\n\n3. **Set the related field for each form in the formset**: When iterating over the `hourformset`, ensure that each form has the `company` field set before attempting to save them.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nif form.is_valid():\n    # Save the parent model instance\n    model_instance = form.save(commit=False)\n    model_instance.pub_date = timezone.now()\n    model_instance.user = current_user.id\n    model_instance.save()\n    my_id = model_instance.pk\n\n    if hourformset.is_valid():\n        # Save each form in the formset\n        for product_form in hourformset:\n            product = product_form.save(commit=False)\n            product.company_id = my_id  # Use company_id for direct assignment\n            product.save()\n    else:\n        print(\"hourformset not saved\")\n\n    return HttpResponseRedirect('/bizprofile/success')\nelse:\n    print(\"modelform not saved\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Use `company_id`**: Instead of setting `product.company = my_id`, set `product.company_id = my_id`. This assigns the foreign key directly.\n- **Iterate carefully**: Ensure that you're checking the validity of each form in the formset before trying to save them.\n- **Handle Errors**: Consider adding error handling to provide more insight into why a form might not be valid.\n\nBy following this approach, you should be able to resolve the error and save both the parent model and its related objects correctly."
