For instance, I have these three lists:\n```python\nx = [1, 2, 3]\ny = [4, 5, 6]\nz = [7, 8, 9]\n```\nI want to append both `y` and `z` to `x` without writing separate append statements like:\n```python\nx.append(y)\nx.append(z)\n```\nI tried using `x.append(y, z)`, but it doesn't seem to work. How can I do this?"

        "content": "In Python, the `append()` method is used to add a single element to the end of a list. However, if you want to append multiple elements (or lists, in your case) to another list, you should use the `extend()` method. The `extend()` method iterates over its argument and adds each element to the list, effectively concatenating the lists.\n\nHere's how you can append both `y` and `z` to `x`:\n\n```python\nx = [1, 2, 3]\ny = [4, 5, 6]\nz = [7, 8, 9]\n\n# Use extend to add elements of y and z to x\nx.extend(y)\nx.extend(z)\n\nprint(x)\n```\n\nAlternatively, you could use the `+` operator to concatenate lists and achieve the same result:\n\n```python\nx = [1, 2, 3]\ny = [4, 5, 6]\nz = [7, 8, 9]\n\n# Concatenate lists using +\nx = x + y + z\n\nprint(x)\n```\n\nBoth methods will result in `x` being `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`."
