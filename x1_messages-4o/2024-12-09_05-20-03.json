Is there a better way to accomplish this?"

        "content": "To silence `stdout` in Python without wrapping a function call and aiming for more efficiency, you can use context management to temporarily redirect `stdout`. This approach ensures that the original `stdout` is restored even if an error occurs during the function execution. Here's how you can achieve this using the `contextlib` module:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport contextlib\n\n# Define a context manager to redirect stdout\n@contextlib.contextmanager\ndef silence_stdout():\n    save_stdout = sys.stdout\n    sys.stdout = open('trash', 'w')\n    try:\n        yield\n    finally:\n        sys.stdout.close()\n        sys.stdout = save_stdout\n\n# Use the context manager\nwith silence_stdout():\n    foo()\n```\n\nIn this example, the `silence_stdout` function is a context manager that temporarily redirects `sys.stdout` to a file named `'trash'`. The original `sys.stdout` is restored after the `with` block is exited, even if an exception occurs within the block. This method is cleaner and more robust, as it uses Python's context management features to handle resource cleanup automatically."
