        "content": "In Python, the terms \"property\" and \"attribute\" often come up in the context of object-oriented programming, and while they can sometimes be used interchangeably, they have distinct meanings and uses:\n\n1. **Attribute:**\n   - An attribute in Python is a variable that is bound to an instance of a class or the class itself. It holds data or references to other objects.\n   - Attributes are accessed using dot notation, e.g., `object.attribute`.\n   - They are typically used to store the state or characteristics of an object.\n   - Example:\n     ```python\n     class Car:\n         def __init__(self, make, model):\n             self.make = make  # make is an attribute\n             self.model = model  # model is an attribute\n\n     my_car = Car('Toyota', 'Corolla')\n     print(my_car.make)  # Accessing the attribute\n     ```\n\n2. **Property:**\n   - A property in Python is a special kind of attribute that allows you to define methods to get, set, and delete its value. Properties provide a way to encapsulate the access to a private attribute.\n   - The `property` decorator is used to define getter, setter, and deleter methods for a property, allowing you to control the behavior of attribute access.\n   - Properties are useful when you need to add logic around getting or setting an attribute's value without changing the interface.\n   - Example:\n     ```python\n     class Car:\n         def __init__(self, make, model):\n             self._make = make\n             self._model = model\n\n         @property\n         def make(self):\n             return self._make\n\n         @make.setter\n         def make(self, value):\n             if not value:\n                 raise ValueError(\"Make cannot be empty\")\n             self._make = value\n\n     my_car = Car('Toyota', 'Corolla')\n     print(my_car.make)  # Accessing the property\n     my_car.make = 'Honda'  # Modifying the property using the setter\n     ```\n\nIn summary, an attribute is a data field and can be accessed directly, while a property is a special kind of attribute that allows you to define custom behavior for getting, setting, and deleting its value. Properties provide a way to use methods like attributes, enabling more controlled access to an object's data."
