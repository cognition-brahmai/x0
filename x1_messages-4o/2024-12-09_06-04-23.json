However, the code is throwing an \"index out of range\" error when I try to increment the list with every new line in the file. How can I resolve this issue? Here is my current code:\n\n```python\ni=0\nList=[\"\"]\nfor Line in inFile:\n   List[i]=Line.split(\",\")\n   i+=1\nprint List\n```"

        "content": "The \"index out of range\" error occurs because you are trying to assign a value to a specific index in the list that doesn't exist yet. In Python, lists do not automatically expand to accommodate new indices like arrays in some other languages. Here's how you can resolve the issue by using the `append()` method to add new elements to the list:\n\n```python\nList = []  # Start with an empty list\nwith open('yourfile.txt', 'r') as inFile:  # Open the file in read mode\n    for Line in inFile:\n        List.append(Line.strip().split(\",\"))  # Append the split line to the list\n\nprint(List)\n```\n\nHere's a brief explanation of the changes:\n\n1. **Initialize an empty list**: Start with `List = []` instead of `List = [\"\"]` to make sure the list is empty initially.\n\n2. **Use `append()` method**: Instead of using an index to add new elements, use `List.append(Line.strip().split(\",\"))`. The `append()` method adds the new element at the end of the list.\n\n3. **Use `strip()`**: This removes any extra spaces or newline characters at the start and end of each line, ensuring the data is clean.\n\n4. **Use a `with` statement**: This is a good practice for handling files as it ensures the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised.\n\nMake sure to replace `'yourfile.txt'` with the actual path to your file. This code will read each line from the file, split it by commas, and add it to the list as a new element."
