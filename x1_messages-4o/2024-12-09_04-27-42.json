I have attempted to do so with the following code:\n\n```\nCMD=\"./my-command --params >stdout.txt 2>stderr.txt\"\necho $CMD\n`$CMD`\n```\nThe expectation is that the command `./my-command --params >stdout.txt 2>stderr.txt` would be printed first and then the command `./my-command --params` would be executed with its output redirected to the specified files. However, I am unable to achieve this result. How can I solve this?"

        "content": "To set up a Bash script that prints each command before executing it for debugging purposes, you can utilize the `set -x` option. This option enables a mode of the shell where all executed commands are printed to the terminal. Here's how you can modify your script to achieve that:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Enable debugging\nset -x\n\nCMD=\"./my-command --params >stdout.txt 2>stderr.txt\"\necho $CMD\neval $CMD\n\n# Disable debugging after the command if needed\nset +x\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **`set -x`**: This command will print each command to the terminal as it is executed. It is useful for debugging purposes.\n\n2. **`eval`**: The `eval` command is used here to execute the command stored in the variable `CMD`. Directly using backticks (or `$()` syntax) would execute the command and capture its output rather than executing it with the intended redirections.\n\n3. **`set +x`**: You can use this command to turn off debugging mode after the command has been executed if you don't want every subsequent command to be printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that your command with its redirections is executed as intended, and you get the desired debugging output in your terminal."
