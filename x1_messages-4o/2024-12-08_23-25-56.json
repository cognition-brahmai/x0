Here's how you can do it:\n\n---\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nYou are given a function `addTwo()` that takes two numerical arguments and returns their sum. Please ensure the following requirements are met:\n\n1. The function should correctly handle and return the sum of any two numbers provided as input, including positive, negative, and zero values.\n\n2. If a discrepancy in the output is observed when calling `addTwo()` with two negative numbers as arguments, the function should provide an explanation for the discrepancy. This explanation should include the following:\n   - A clear description of the observed discrepancy.\n   - An analysis of potential causes for the discrepancy.\n   - Suggestions for resolving the issue, if applicable.\n\nBy including this requirement, you ensure that any unexpected behavior when dealing with negative numbers is addressed, and an explanation is provided to facilitate debugging and resolution."
