Let's analyze the sentence you provided:\n\n\"This is sentence with a palindrome\"\n\nFirst, we should separate the sentence into individual words:\n- This\n- is\n- sentence\n- with\n- a\n- palindrome\n\nNext, let's check for palindromic words:\n\n- \"This\" is not a palindrome.\n- \"is\" is not a palindrome.\n- \"sentence\" is not a palindrome.\n- \"with\" is not a palindrome.\n- \"a\" is a palindrome (single character).\n- \"palindrome\" is not a palindrome.\n\nThe longest palindrome present in the sentence is \"a,\" which is a single character palindrome. However, if your sentence had other hidden palindromic sequences or words, they might not be evident from this particular input. If you meant a specific palindrome or there are more complex palindromic structures in another context, feel free to provide additional details!"
