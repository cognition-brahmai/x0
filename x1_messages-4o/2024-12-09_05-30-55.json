What would be a more effective way to accomplish this?"

        "content": "If you want to swap or reorder a small number of columns in a DataFrame without explicitly listing all of them, you can use a more dynamic approach. Here's a method that allows you to swap any two columns or reorder a few columns without having to deal with the entire list:\n\n### Swapping Two Columns\n\nIf you want to swap two columns, say `FirstName` and `LastName`, you can do this:\n\n```python\ncols = list(df.columns)\na, b = cols.index('FirstName'), cols.index('LastName')\ncols[b], cols[a] = cols[a], cols[b]\ndf = df[cols]\n```\n\n### Reordering a Few Columns\n\nIf you want to move some columns around, you can use a similar approach. Suppose you want to reorder `MiddleName`, `LastName`, and `Contact`:\n\n```python\ncols = list(df.columns)\n\n# Identify indices of the columns you want to reorder\nmove_cols = ['MiddleName', 'LastName', 'Contact']\nindices = [cols.index(col) for col in move_cols]\n\n# Remove these columns from the list\nfor col in move_cols:\n    cols.remove(col)\n\n# Insert them back in the desired order at the desired position\ninsert_position = 2  # Position where you want to insert the reordered columns\nfor i, col in enumerate(move_cols):\n    cols.insert(insert_position + i, col)\n\ndf = df[cols]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Swapping Columns**: Identify the indices of the two columns you want to swap, and then swap them in the list of columns.\n- **Reordering Columns**: Extract the columns you want to reorder, remove them, and then insert them back in the desired order at the desired position in the column list.\n\nThis approach is flexible and can be adapted to swap or reorder any number of columns without having to re-specify the entire column order."
