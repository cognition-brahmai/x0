        "content": "Yes, you can create a PHP script to determine if a given string contains any special characters by using regular expressions. Here's a simple example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```php\nfunction containsSpecialCharacters($string) {\n    // Regular expression to match any character that is not a letter or a number\n    return preg_match('/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/', $string);\n}\n\n$string = \"HelloWorld123!\";\n\nif (containsSpecialCharacters($string)) {\n    echo \"The string contains special characters.\";\n} else {\n    echo \"The string does not contain any special characters.\";\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The `preg_match` function is used to perform a regular expression match.\n- The regular expression `/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/` checks for any character that is not a letter (both uppercase and lowercase) or a number. The `^` inside the brackets `[]` denotes negation.\n- If `preg_match` finds a match, it returns `1`, indicating that the string contains special characters. Otherwise, it returns `0`.\n\nYou can test this script with different strings to see if they contain any special characters."
