I have tried adding a new column to my existing DataFrame with the mapped value from a dictionary but I'm getting an error. Here is a small test case I tried:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nequiv = {7001:1, 8001:2, 9001:3}\ndf = pd.DataFrame( {\"A\": [7001, 8001, 9001]} )\ndf[\"B\"] = equiv(df[\"A\"])\nprint(df)\n```\n\nI expected the output:\n\n```python\n      A   B\n0  7001   1\n1  8001   2\n2  9001   3\n```\n\nBut instead, I get an error saying that equiv is not a callable function. I tried wrapping it in a function and then using a map function, but I still get errors:\n\n```python\ndf[\"B\"] = df[\"A\"].map(lambda x:equiv[x])\n```\n\nIn this case, I get a KeyError: 8001. I've read through documentation and previous posts, but have not found how to mix dictionaries with pandas DataFrames. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the way you're trying to apply the mapping. The error you mentioned, `KeyError: 8001`, suggests that there might be values in your column that are not present in the `equiv` dictionary. However, based on your provided test case, the dictionary does contain all the keys that are present in the DataFrame column. \n\nThe initial error was because you attempted to call the dictionary `equiv` as if it were a function. The correct approach is to use the `map` method on the DataFrame column to apply the dictionary mapping.\n\nHere's how you can do it correctly:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create the mapping dictionary\nequiv = {7001: 1, 8001: 2, 9001: 3}\n\n# Create the DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\"A\": [7001, 8001, 9001]})\n\n# Use the map method to map the values in column A according to the dictionary equiv\ndf[\"B\"] = df[\"A\"].map(equiv)\n\n# Print the DataFrame\nprint(df)\n```\n\nThis should give you the expected output:\n\n```\n      A  B\n0  7001  1\n1  8001  2\n2  9001  3\n```\n\nA few points to consider:\n- Make sure that all values in the column you're mapping from exist as keys in your dictionary. If there might be values not present in the dictionary, the `map` method will return `NaN` for those entries.\n- If you need to handle missing keys more gracefully, you can use the `fillna` method to provide a default value, like so:\n\n  ```python\n  df[\"B\"] = df[\"A\"].map(equiv).fillna(-1)  # Replace -1 with any default value you prefer\n  ```\n\nThis approach ensures that you handle any potential mismatches between the DataFrame and the dictionary gracefully."
