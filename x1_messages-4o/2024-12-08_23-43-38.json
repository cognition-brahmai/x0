In the context of integrating data into an HTML page, an API is a set of rules and protocols that allows your application (in this case, your HTML page) to communicate with an external service or data source. \n\nBy using an API, you can request data from an external source and then use that data within your web page. This is typically done by making HTTP requests to the API's endpoints, which return data in a structured format, often JSON or XML. You can then use JavaScript to process and display this data in your HTML page, allowing you to dynamically integrate and update content from the external source."
