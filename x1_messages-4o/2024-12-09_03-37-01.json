        "content": "Using fixtures in pytest is indeed a suitable approach for running additional setup and teardown checks before and after each test. Fixtures provide a way to create setup and teardown code that can be shared across multiple tests. You can create a fixture that runs before and after each test to perform your checks for temporary files.\n\nHere\u2019s a general approach on how you could implement this:\n\n1. **Create a Fixture for Setup and Teardown:**\n   \n   You can create a fixture that checks for temporary files before and after each test. This fixture can be scoped to run for each test function by setting `scope='function'`.\n\n2. **Implement the Temporary File Check:**\n\n   Within the fixture, you can implement logic to verify the absence of temporary files at the start of a test and to ensure cleanup after the test execution.\n\n3. **Use `request` Fixture for Access to Test Info:**\n\n   You can use the `request` fixture to get information about the test function being executed, which can be helpful for logging or debugging.\n\nHere's an illustrative example:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport pytest\n\n# Define a list of temporary files/directories to check\nTEMP_FILES = ['temp_file_1.txt', 'temp_file_2.txt']\n\n@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)\ndef check_temp_files(request):\n    # Setup: Ensure no temp files are present before the test\n    for temp_file in TEMP_FILES:\n        if os.path.exists(temp_file):\n            pytest.fail(f\"Temporary file {temp_file} exists before test {request.node.name} starts.\")\n\n    yield  # This is where the test runs\n\n    # Teardown: Ensure no temp files are present after the test\n    for temp_file in TEMP_FILES:\n        if os.path.exists(temp_file):\n            pytest.fail(f\"Temporary file {temp_file} was not cleaned up after test {request.node.name}.\")\n\n# Example test that would fail if it leaves a temp file\ndef test_example():\n    # Simulate creating a temp file\n    with open('temp_file_1.txt', 'w') as f:\n        f.write(\"Temporary data\")\n    # Normally, you would include code that deletes the temporary file\n    # If you comment out the file deletion, this test will fail due to the fixture\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **autouse=True**: This parameter makes the fixture run automatically for each test without needing to explicitly include it in the test function.\n- **yield**: The code before `yield` acts as the setup, and the code after `yield` acts as the teardown.\n- **TEMP_FILES**: This is a list of files you expect to be cleaned up between tests.\n- **pytest.fail()**: This function is used to immediately fail the test if a condition is not met.\n\nBy using this fixture, you ensure that your tests will fail if they leave behind any specified temporary files, promoting better test hygiene and resource management."
