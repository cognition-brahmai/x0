I've set a custom environment variable in BASH and I'm trying to pull it into my Python code using os.getenv(), but it's not working. Here's a sample of what I've tried:\n\nBASH:\n```\n$ FRUSTRATION=\"PYTHON!!\"\n$ echo $FRUSTRATION\nPYTHON!!\n$ ipython\n```\n\nPython:\n```\nIn [1]: import os\nIn [2]: very_frustrated = os.getenv(\"FRUSTRATION\")\nIn [3]: print(very_frustrated)\nNone\n```\n\nDespite setting the environment variable \"FRUSTRATION\" to \"PYTHON!!\" in BASH, Python's os.getenv() is returning None when I try to retrieve it. How can I solve this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is related to how environment variables are inherited by child processes in the shell. When you set an environment variable in a shell session, it's available to that session and any child processes spawned from it. However, if you start a new session (like opening `ipython`), it won't inherit those variables unless they are exported.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can resolve this issue:\n\n### Solution: Export the Environment Variable\n\nYou need to export the environment variable so that it will be available to any child processes, including Python shells. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Set and Export the Environment Variable in BASH:**\n\n   ```bash\n   $ export FRUSTRATION=\"PYTHON!!\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify the Export:**\n\n   Ensure that the variable is exported properly:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ echo $FRUSTRATION\n   PYTHON!!\n   ```\n\n3. **Launch Python or IPython:**\n\n   Now, start `ipython` or `python` from the same shell session:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ ipython\n   ```\n\n4. **Access the Environment Variable in Python:**\n\n   ```python\n   In [1]: import os\n   In [2]: very_frustrated = os.getenv(\"FRUSTRATION\")\n   In [3]: print(very_frustrated)\n   PYTHON!!\n   ```\n\nBy exporting the variable, you ensure that it is available to subprocesses of the shell, including your Python interpreter. This should solve the problem and allow you to access the environment variable using `os.getenv()`."
