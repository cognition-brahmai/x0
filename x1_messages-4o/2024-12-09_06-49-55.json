I notice from the PyQt5 documentation that `app.exec()` is used, but I am aware that `exec` is a keyword in Python and I am wondering if there might be a clash. When I tested both on my machine, I did not notice any visible difference or any time difference in output. Here is my test program:\n\n```python\nfrom PyQt5.QtCore import *\nfrom PyQt5.QtWidgets import *\nimport sys\n\nclass window(QWidget):\n    def __init__(self,parent=None):\n        super().__init__(parent)\n        self.setWindowTitle('test')\n        self.resize(250,200)\n\napp=QApplication(sys.argv)\nw=window()\nw.show()\nsys.exit(app.exec())\n#sys.exit(app.exec_())\n```\n\nIs there any issue with using `app.exec()`? Can I use `app.exec()` and `app.exec_()` interchangeably?"

        "content": "In PyQt5, you can indeed use both `app.exec()` and `app.exec_()` interchangeably in most cases, and you won't notice any difference in behavior or performance. Here's a bit of background to clarify the situation:\n\n1. **Historical Context**: \n   - In earlier versions of PyQt, particularly when Python 2 was still in common use, `exec_()` was used to avoid conflict with the `exec` keyword in Python 2. \n   - Python 3, however, treats `exec` as a function rather than a keyword, which allows `exec()` to be used without any issues.\n\n2. **PyQt5 and Python 3**:\n   - With the evolution of Python and the transition from Python 2 to Python 3, `exec()` became available for use in PyQt applications because there is no longer a conflict with Python's syntax.\n\n3. **Documentation and Consistency**:\n   - The official PyQt5 documentation may show `exec()` because it reflects the current compatibility with Python 3.\n   - However, many developers still use `exec_()` out of habit or for consistency with older codebases.\n\n4. **Recommendation**:\n   - If you're using Python 3, you can safely use `app.exec()` without any issues.\n   - If you are maintaining or working with legacy code that still uses `exec_()`, it's perfectly fine to continue using it for consistency.\n\nIn summary, for new projects with Python 3, you can use `app.exec()`. If you are updating or maintaining older code, using `app.exec_()` is still acceptable, but you might consider updating to `app.exec()` for consistency with modern Python practices."
