You can install it using pip if it's not already installed:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install virtualenv\n   ```\n\n2. **Locate the specific Python version**: Before creating the virtual environment, you need to know the path to the specific Python version you want to use. You can list the available Python versions on your system using commands like `which python3.x` on Unix-based systems or `where python` on Windows.\n\n3. **Create the virtual environment**: Use the `virtualenv` command along with the `-p` or `--python` flag to specify the path of the desired Python executable. Here's an example:\n\n   ```bash\n   virtualenv -p /path/to/pythonX.Y myenv\n   ```\n\n   Replace `/path/to/pythonX.Y` with the actual path to the Python version you want to use (e.g., `/usr/bin/python3.8`), and `myenv` with the desired name of your virtual environment.\n\n4. **Activate the virtual environment**: Once the virtual environment is created, activate it to start using it.\n\n   - On Unix or macOS, use:\n\n     ```bash\n     source myenv/bin/activate\n     ```\n\n   - On Windows, use:\n\n     ```bash\n     myenv\\Scripts\\activate\n     ```\n\n5. **Verify the Python version**: After activation, verify that the virtual environment is using the correct version of Python by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   ```\n\nThis should display the specific Python version you chose for your virtual environment. You can now install packages and run your Python applications within this isolated environment."
