I need a simple solution that works with any 2D array. I've been trying to get the following code to work:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib as ml\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nH = [[1,2,3,4][5,6,7,8][9,10,11,12][13,14,15,16]]\n\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(6, 3.2))\n\nax = fig.add_subplot(111)\nax.set_title('colorMap')\nX,Y = np.meshgrid(xedges, yedges)\nplt.pcolormesh(X, Y, H)\nax.set_aspect('equal')\n\ncax = fig.add_axes([0.12, 0.1, 0.78, 0.8])\ncax.get_xaxis().set_visible(False)\ncax.get_yaxis().set_visible(False)\ncax.patch.set_alpha(0)\ncax.set_frame_on(False)\nplt.colorbar(orientation='vertical')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nBut I'm facing difficulty getting the desired result."

        "content": "It looks like there are a few issues with your code that need to be addressed in order to successfully plot a 2D array as a color plot:\n\n1. The array `H` is not properly defined. It should be a list of lists with commas separating them.\n2. The variables `xedges` and `yedges` are not defined.\n3. The placement of the color bar is incorrect, and there's no specific axis set for it.\n4. The meshgrid isn't necessary unless you have specific edge values.\n\nHere's a corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Define the 2D array\nH = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4],\n              [5, 6, 7, 8],\n              [9, 10, 11, 12],\n              [13, 14, 15, 16]])\n\n# Create a figure and axis\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 3.2))\n\n# Set title\nax.set_title('Color Map')\n\n# Plot the 2D array using pcolormesh\nc = ax.pcolormesh(H, cmap='viridis', edgecolors='k', linewidth=0.2)\n\n# Set the aspect of the plot to be equal\nax.set_aspect('equal')\n\n# Add a color bar\ncbar = fig.colorbar(c, ax=ax)\ncbar.set_label('Color Scale')\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Array Definition**: The array `H` should be a proper 2D numpy array.\n- **Plotting**: `pcolormesh` is used for plotting the 2D array as a color plot.\n- **Color Map**: You can choose different color maps such as `'viridis'`, `'plasma'`, `'inferno'`, etc.\n- **Color Bar**: `fig.colorbar` is used to add a color bar, which is linked to the plot with the `pcolormesh` object `c`.\n- **Aspect Ratio**: Setting `ax.set_aspect('equal')` ensures that the plot has equal aspect ratio, making the cells square.\n\nThis code should give you a nice color plot of the 2D array with a color bar and a title."
