However, the results are distinct. Here are the two list comprehensions:\n\n```python\nf = lambda x: x*x\n[f(x) for x in range(10)]\n```\n\nand\n\n```python\n[lambda x: x*x for x in range(10)]\n```\n\nMoreover, when I check the types of `f` and `lambda x: x*x`, they both return the same type. Why is this the case?"

        "content": "The difference in outputs between the two list comprehensions arises from how they are constructed and evaluated, even though both involve lambda functions.\n\n1. **First List Comprehension:**\n   ```python\n   f = lambda x: x*x\n   [f(x) for x in range(10)]\n   ```\n\n   - Here, `f` is a lambda function defined to compute the square of its input. \n   - The list comprehension `[f(x) for x in range(10)]` iterates over each number `x` in the range from 0 to 9, applying `f(x)` to each one, and hence results in a list of their squares: `[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]`.\n\n2. **Second List Comprehension:**\n   ```python\n   [lambda x: x*x for x in range(10)]\n   ```\n\n   - In this case, the list comprehension generates a list of lambda functions, not their results. It creates a new lambda function `(lambda x: x*x)` for each iteration over the range 0 to 9.\n   - Thus, the output is a list of 10 lambda functions, each of which, when called, will square its argument, but they are not called during the comprehension. This results in a list of function objects, not their evaluations.\n\nWhen you check the types of `f` and `lambda x: x*x`, they both return `<class 'function'>` because both are indeed functions defined using the lambda expression.\n\nThe key difference is that in the first comprehension, you're invoking the function `f` and collecting its results, whereas in the second comprehension, you're collecting the function objects themselves without invoking them."
