        "content": "To filter through the list of recipes and display only those that are both gluten-free and low in calories (under 300 calories), you can use the provided `filterRecipes` function. This function utilizes the `filter` method of arrays to iterate through each recipe and check if it meets the criteria of being gluten-free and having fewer than 300 calories. Here\u2019s how you can implement and use this function:\n\n```javascript\nvar recipes = [\n  {\n    name: \"Chicken and Rice Soup\",\n    ingredients: [\"Rice\", \"Onions\", \"Chicken\"],\n    glutenFree: true,\n    calories: 250\n  },\n  {\n    name: \"Grilled Chicken with Caramelized Onions\",\n    ingredients: [\"Onions\", \"Chicken\"],\n    glutenFree: true,\n    calories: 200\n  },\n  {\n    name: \"Creamy Chicken and Rice Casserole\",\n    ingredients: [\"Rice\", \"Onions\", \"Chicken\", \"Cream\"],\n    glutenFree: false,\n    calories: 500\n  }\n];\n\nfunction filterRecipes(recipes) {\n  return recipes.filter(function(recipe) {\n    return recipe.glutenFree && recipe.calories < 300;\n  });\n}\n\nvar filteredRecipes = filterRecipes(recipes);\nconsole.log(filteredRecipes);\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, the `filteredRecipes` variable will contain only the recipes that are gluten-free and have fewer than 300 calories. Based on the provided list, the output will be:\n\n```javascript\n[\n  {\n    name: \"Chicken and Rice Soup\",\n    ingredients: [\"Rice\", \"Onions\", \"Chicken\"],\n    glutenFree: true,\n    calories: 250\n  },\n  {\n    name: \"Grilled Chicken with Caramelized Onions\",\n    ingredients: [\"Onions\", \"Chicken\"],\n    glutenFree: true,\n    calories: 200\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThese are the recipes that meet the specified criteria."
