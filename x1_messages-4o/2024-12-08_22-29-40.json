        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of nickels and dimes, given the constraints:\n\n- Total number of coins = 25\n- Total value = $1.60\n- Total weight = 200 grams\n- Weight of a nickel = 5 grams\n- Weight of a dime = 2.27 grams\n- Value of a nickel = $0.05\n- Value of a dime = $0.10\n\nLet's denote:\n- Number of nickels = n\n- Number of dimes = d\n\nWe have the following equations based on the problem:\n1. \\( n + d = 25 \\)\n2. \\( 0.05n + 0.10d = 1.60 \\)\n\nSolving these equations:\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\\[ n = 25 - d \\]\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\\[ 0.05(25 - d) + 0.10d = 1.60 \\]\n\\[ 1.25 - 0.05d + 0.10d = 1.60 \\]\n\\[ 0.05d = 0.35 \\]\n\\[ d = 7 \\]\n\nThus, \\( n = 18 \\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the total weight to confirm:\n- Weight of nickels = \\( 18 \\times 5 = 90 \\) grams\n- Weight of dimes = \\( 7 \\times 2.27 = 15.89 \\) grams\n- Total weight = \\( 90 + 15.89 \\approx 105.89 \\) grams\n\nSince the total weight doesn't match, let's re-evaluate using the given total weight (assuming rounding errors or using other constraints):\n\nThe weight equation should be:\n\\[ 5n + 2.27d = 200 \\]\n\nSubstitute \\( n = 25 - d \\):\n\\[ 5(25 - d) + 2.27d = 200 \\]\n\\[ 125 - 5d + 2.27d = 200 \\]\n\\[ -2.73d = 75 \\]\n\\[ d \\approx 27.47 \\]\n\nSince this doesn't make sense, let's assume the values of weight and coin numbers are hypothetical for display purposes, as the actual values would be non-integers or constraints are incorrect. \n\n### HTML Table and CSS Example:\n\nHere's an example of HTML code to display the table of nickels and dimes with their respective weights and values, and a CSS part to highlight which coin is more expensive in terms of weight:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <style>\n        table {\n            width: 50%;\n            border-collapse: collapse;\n        }\n        th, td {\n            border: 1px solid black;\n            padding: 8px;\n            text-align: center;\n        }\n        th {\n            background-color: #f2f2f2;\n        }\n        .expensive {\n            background-color: #ffcccc;\n        }\n    </style>\n    <title>Coins Table</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<h2>Coins Weight and Value Table</h2>\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <th>Coin Type</th>\n        <th>Number of Coins</th>\n        <th>Total Weight (grams)</th>\n        <th>Total Value ($)</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Nickels</td>\n        <td>18</td>\n        <td>90</td>\n        <td>0.90</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr class=\"expensive\">\n        <td>Dimes</td>\n        <td>7</td>\n        <td>15.89</td>\n        <td>0.70</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n\n<p>The row highlighted in red indicates the coin which is more expensive in terms of its weight (dimes in this hypothetical scenario).</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nIn this hypothetical scenario, I've highlighted the row for dimes because they are typically more valuable per unit weight. Adjust the logic based on the correct constraints or assumptions."
