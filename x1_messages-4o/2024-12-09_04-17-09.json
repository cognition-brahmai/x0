        "content": "I have a SQLite database storing temperature values, and I'm having an issue when trying to sort the list of these values. I'm reading the temperature values from the database into a list and populating a combo box with this information. However, when I add a new temperature value to the database, it gets appended to the end of the list. For example, my initial list is ['25', '50', '100', '150', '200', '250', '300'], and if I add '33', the list becomes ['25', '50', '100', '150', '200', '250', '300', '33']. If I then use templist.sort() or sorted(templist), the list is sorted incorrectly as ['150', '200', '25', '250', '300', '33', '50']. How can I sort this list of numerical strings in ascending order so that the output is ['25', '33', '50', '100', '150', '200', '250', '300']?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that the temperature values are being stored as strings in your list. When you use `sort()` or `sorted()` on a list of strings, it performs a lexicographical sort, which means it sorts based on the character order rather than numerical value. To sort the list numerically, you need to convert the string values to integers before sorting.\n\nHere's how you can achieve the desired sorting:\n\n```python\n# Original list of temperature values as strings\ntemplist = ['25', '50', '100', '150', '200', '250', '300', '33']\n\n# Convert the list of strings to a list of integers\ntemplist = [int(temp) for temp in templist]\n\n# Sort the list of integers\ntemplist.sort()\n\n# If you need the sorted list as strings again, convert back to strings\ntemplist = [str(temp) for temp in templist]\n\n# Print the sorted list\nprint(templist)  # Output: ['25', '33', '50', '100', '150', '200', '250', '300']\n```\n\nUsing this approach, you convert the string values to integers, sort them numerically, and then convert them back to strings if needed for display or further processing. This will ensure that your list is sorted in numerical ascending order."
