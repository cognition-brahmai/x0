The HTML data I am interested in is represented in the following format:\n\n```HTML\n<table class=\"details\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"95%\">\n  <tr valign=\"top\">\n    <th>Tests</th>\n    <th>Failures</th>\n    <th>Success Rate</th>\n    <th>Average Time</th>\n    <th>Min Time</th>\n    <th>Max Time</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr valign=\"top\" class=\"Failure\">\n    <th>103</th>\n    <th>24</th>\n    <th>76.70%</th>\n    <th>71 ms</th>\n    <th>0 ms</th>\n    <th>829 ms</th>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n```\n\nI would like to extract this data and store it in shell variables or echo these in key-value pairs, for example:\n\n```Shell\nTests         : 103\nFailures      : 24\nSuccess Rate  : 76.70 %\nand so on..\n```\n\nCurrently, I am able to use a Java program with a sax parser or HTML parser like jsoup to extract this information, but implementing Java seems like overkill here. I am sure there are shell languages that can achieve the same result like Perl, Python, or Bash. However, I am not familiar with these languages. Additionally, I should mention that my HTML document contains multiple tables and rows.\n\nI have also tried installing BeautifulSoup like this, but I am encountering syntax errors:\n\n```Shell\n$ wget http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/download/4.0/beautifulsoup4-4.1.0.tar.gz\n$ tar -zxvf beautifulsoup4-4.1.0.tar.gz\n$ cp -r beautifulsoup4-4.1.0/bs4 .\n$ vi htmlParse.py # (paste code from ) Tichodromas' answer, just in case this (http://pastebin.com/4Je11Y9q) is what I pasted\n$ run file (python htmlParse.py)\n```\n\nError:\n\n```Shell\n$ python htmlParse.py\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"htmlParse.py\", line 1, in ?\n    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n  File \"/home/gdd/setup/py/bs4/__init__.py\", line 29\n    from .builder import builder_registry\n         ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n```\n\nWhen I try to run an answer provided by Tichodromas, I get this error:\n\n```Shell\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"test.py\", line 27, in ?\n    headings = [th.get_text() for th in table.find(\"tr\").find_all(\"th\")]\nTypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable\n```\n\nCan someone help me to solve this issue?"

        "content": "To extract data from an HTML table in a Linux shell environment, you can use a combination of tools like `xmllint`, `grep`, `sed`, and `awk`. However, since you have mentioned that you're open to using Python, I would recommend using `BeautifulSoup` for a more straightforward solution. Let's address the issues and create a working script.\n\n### Step 1: Install BeautifulSoup\n\nFirst, ensure you have `pip` installed. Then, you can install BeautifulSoup via pip:\n\n```shell\npip install beautifulsoup4\n```\n\nIf you encounter any issues with installation, make sure that your environment is set up properly with Python and pip.\n\n### Step 2: Write a Python Script\n\nHere is a simple Python script using BeautifulSoup to extract the data you need:\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\nhtml_content = \"\"\"\n<table class=\"details\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"95%\">\n  <tr valign=\"top\">\n    <th>Tests</th>\n    <th>Failures</th>\n    <th>Success Rate</th>\n    <th>Average Time</th>\n    <th>Min Time</th>\n    <th>Max Time</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr valign=\"top\" class=\"Failure\">\n    <th>103</th>\n    <th>24</th>\n    <th>76.70%</th>\n    <th>71 ms</th>\n    <th>0 ms</th>\n    <th>829 ms</th>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\"\"\"\n\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')\ntable = soup.find(\"table\", {\"class\": \"details\"})\n\nif table:\n    headers = [header.get_text(strip=True) for header in table.find_all(\"tr\")[0].find_all(\"th\")]\n    values = [value.get_text(strip=True) for value in table.find_all(\"tr\")[1].find_all(\"th\")]\n\n    for header, value in zip(headers, values):\n        print(f\"{header} : {value}\")\n\nelse:\n    print(\"Table not found\")\n```\n\n### Step 3: Run the Script\n\nSave this script to a file, for example `extract_table.py`, and run it using Python:\n\n```shell\npython extract_table.py\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **BeautifulSoup**: This library is used to parse HTML and XML documents. It provides Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.\n- **find and find_all**: These methods help locate elements in the HTML document. In this script, we use them to identify the 'table' and 'th' tags.\n- **get_text(strip=True)**: This method extracts text from the tags and strips any extra whitespace.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter issues with `BeautifulSoup`, ensure the following:\n\n- You have installed `beautifulsoup4` correctly.\n- You are using an up-to-date Python version.\n- Your HTML content is correctly passed to the BeautifulSoup parser.\n\nIf your HTML document has multiple tables and rows, adjust the selection logic in the script accordingly to target the specific table or rows you are interested in."
