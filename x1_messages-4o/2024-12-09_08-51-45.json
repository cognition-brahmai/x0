        "content": "Certainly! Quick sort is a popular and efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort elements. Below is a Python implementation of the quick sort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef quick_sort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    else:\n        pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]  # Choose the middle element as the pivot\n        left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]  # Elements less than the pivot\n        middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]  # Elements equal to the pivot\n        right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]  # Elements greater than the pivot\n        return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    arr = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]\n    sorted_arr = quick_sort(arr)\n    print(\"Sorted array:\", sorted_arr)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Base Case**: If the array has 0 or 1 element, it is already sorted, so we return it as is.\n\n2. **Pivot Selection**: We choose the middle element of the array as the pivot. This choice can affect performance, but choosing the middle element is a common practice.\n\n3. **Partitioning**: We create three sub-arrays:\n   - `left`: Contains elements less than the pivot.\n   - `middle`: Contains elements equal to the pivot.\n   - `right`: Contains elements greater than the pivot.\n\n4. **Recursive Call**: We recursively apply the quick sort algorithm to the `left` and `right` sub-arrays.\n\n5. **Concatenation**: We concatenate the sorted `left` sub-array, the `middle` sub-array, and the sorted `right` sub-array to produce the final sorted array.\n\nThis implementation is simple and easy to understand but may not be the most efficient for large arrays due to the use of additional memory for sub-arrays. In practice, in-place quick sort implementations are often used, which modify the array directly."
