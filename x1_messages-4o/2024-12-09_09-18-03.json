        "content": "To display a list of employees who have experience between 5 and 10 years, you can use an SQL query that calculates the years of experience for each employee and filters the results based on this condition. Assuming you have a table named `employees` with a column `hire_date`, which stores the date an employee was hired, you can use the following query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM employees\nWHERE DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), hire_date) / 365 BETWEEN 5 AND 10;\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the query:\n\n- `DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), hire_date)` calculates the difference in days between the current date and the hire date.\n- Dividing the result by 365 converts the difference from days to approximate years.\n- `BETWEEN 5 AND 10` filters out employees who have between 5 and 10 years of experience.\n\nMake sure to adjust the query according to your actual table and column names. Additionally, keep in mind that using `DATEDIFF` and division by 365 assumes a rough year calculation without considering leap years or exact start and end dates. If your database system supports more precise date calculations, you might want to use those for more accuracy."
