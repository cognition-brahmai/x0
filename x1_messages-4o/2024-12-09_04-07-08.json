The code I'm using is:\n\n```python\nimport pymysql\nconn = pymysql.connect(db='base', user='root', passwd='pwd', host='localhost')\n```\nHowever, I'm getting the following errors on both Python 2.7 and Python 3.2:\n\n```python\nsocket.error: [Errno 111] Connection refused\npymysql.err.OperationalError: (2003, \"Can't connect to MySQL server on 'localhost' (111)\")\n```\nI'm certain that mysqld is running because I can connect using the `mysql` command or phpMyAdmin. Furthermore, I can connect using MySQLdb on Python 2 with almost the same code:\n\n```python\nimport MySQLdb\nconn = MySQLdb.connect(db='base', user='root', passwd='pwd', host='localhost')\n```\nIt seems that the issue is on PyMySQL's side rather than MySQL's but I'm not sure how to resolve it. Can you help?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, `Connection refused`, suggests that the MySQL server is not accepting connections via the method PyMySQL is attempting. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check MySQL Server Configuration**:\n   - Ensure that MySQL is configured to accept TCP/IP connections. Check your MySQL configuration file (usually `my.cnf` or `my.ini`) for the `bind-address` directive. It should be set to `0.0.0.0` or `127.0.0.1` to allow connections on localhost.\n   - Verify that the `skip-networking` line is not present or commented out in your MySQL configuration, as this would disable TCP/IP networking.\n\n2. **Use the Correct Host**:\n   - PyMySQL uses TCP/IP by default, while `MySQLdb` might use a Unix socket. Try using `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` in the `host` parameter to force TCP/IP.\n\n3. **Check Port Number**:\n   - Ensure you are connecting to the correct port (default is 3306). You can specify the port in the `connect` method like this: `conn = pymysql.connect(db='base', user='root', passwd='pwd', host='127.0.0.1', port=3306)`.\n\n4. **Firewall and SELinux**:\n   - If you're on a Linux system, ensure that the firewall is not blocking MySQL connections. Check your firewall rules with `iptables` or `firewalld`.\n   - If SELinux is enabled, it might be blocking the connection. Temporarily disable it to see if this resolves the issue.\n\n5. **Check MySQL User Permissions**:\n   - Ensure that the MySQL user has the necessary permissions to connect from `localhost`. You can verify this by running:\n     ```sql\n     SELECT host FROM mysql.user WHERE user='root';\n     ```\n   - Make sure `localhost` or `%` is listed.\n\n6. **Test with a Simple Script**:\n   - Try a simple script to ensure that PyMySQL is working as expected:\n     ```python\n     import pymysql\n     try:\n         conn = pymysql.connect(host='127.0.0.1', user='root', passwd='pwd', db='base')\n         print(\"Connection successful\")\n     except pymysql.MySQLError as e:\n         print(f\"Connection error: {e}\")\n     ```\n\n7. **Upgrade PyMySQL**:\n   - Ensure that you're using the latest version of PyMySQL. You can upgrade it using pip:\n     ```bash\n     pip install --upgrade pymysql\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue preventing PyMySQL from connecting to your MySQL server on localhost."
