        "content": "In Python, when you use the `del` statement on a variable, it does not immediately free the memory allocated to the object that the variable references. Instead, it decreases the reference count of that object by one. If the reference count of the object reaches zero, meaning there are no more references to it, then the memory can be freed. However, the actual freeing of memory is managed by Python's garbage collector.\n\nPython uses a combination of reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to manage memory. The reference counting mechanism will immediately handle deallocating memory when the reference count drops to zero. However, if there are reference cycles (objects referencing each other), they won't have their reference counts drop to zero, and the garbage collector will periodically identify and clean these up.\n\nSo, the behavior is somewhat different from Java. In Java, memory management is primarily handled by the garbage collector, and manual memory deallocation is not part of the language's design. In Python, while `del` affects reference counts, the actual memory freeing process is still reliant on the garbage collection system, especially in cases involving cyclic references."
