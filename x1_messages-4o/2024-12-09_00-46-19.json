        "content": "How can I construct a 3D DataFrame in Pandas? I want a DataFrame where 'A', 'B', etc are the top-level descriptors and 'start' and 'end' are subdescriptors. The numbers that follow are in pairs and there aren't the same number of pairs for 'A', 'B' etc. For example, 'A' has four such pairs, 'B' has only 1, and 'C' has 3. My current approach is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\nA = np.array(['one', 'one', 'two', 'two', 'three', 'three'])\nB = np.array(['start', 'end']*3)\nC = [np.random.randint(10, 99, 6)]*6\ndf = pd.DataFrame(zip(A, B, C), columns=['A', 'B', 'C'])\ndf.set_index(['A', 'B'], inplace=True)\ndf\n```\n\nHowever, this gives me:\n\n```python\n                C\n A          B   \n one        start   [22, 19, 16, 20, 63, 54]\n              end   [22, 19, 16, 20, 63, 54]\n two        start   [22, 19, 16, 20, 63, 54]\n              end   [22, 19, 16, 20, 63, 54]\n three      start   [22, 19, 16, 20, 63, 54]\n              end   [22, 19, 16, 20, 63, 54]\n```\n\nI'm looking for a way to break up the lists in C into their own columns. My C looks like this:\n\n```python\nC = [[7,11,56,45], [20,21,74,12], [42], [52], [90,213,9], [101, 34, 45]]\n```\n\nAnd the desired output is the one at the top. It represents the starting and ending points of subsequences within a certain sequence ('A', 'B', 'C' are the different sequences). Depending on the sequence itself, there are a differing number of subsequences that satisfy a given condition I'm looking for. As a result, there are a differing number of start:end pairs for 'A', 'B', etc."

        "content": "To achieve your desired output, you need to modify your approach to handle uneven lengths of lists in column `C`. You can do this by creating a DataFrame for each of your sequences and then concatenating them into a single DataFrame. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Define your data\ndata = {\n    ('A', 'start'): [7, 42, 90],\n    ('A', 'end'): [11, 52, 213],\n    ('B', 'start'): [56],\n    ('B', 'end'): [45],\n    ('C', 'start'): [20, 101],\n    ('C', 'end'): [21, 34]\n}\n\n# Create a DataFrame from the data\ndf = pd.DataFrame(dict([(k, pd.Series(v)) for k, v in data.items()]))\n\n# Display the DataFrame\nprint(df)\n```\n\nHere's the explanation of the code:\n\n1. **Data Structure**: We use a dictionary where keys are tuples representing multi-level columns (`('A', 'start')`, `('A', 'end')`, etc.).\n\n2. **Creating the DataFrame**: We convert each list in the dictionary into a Pandas Series. This allows for varying lengths, as Pandas will fill in `NaN` for shorter lists when aligning them into a DataFrame.\n\n3. **Result**: The resulting DataFrame has a multi-level column index, with 'A', 'B', and 'C' as the top-level categories and 'start' and 'end' as the sub-levels.\n\nWith this setup, each sequence ('A', 'B', 'C') can have a different number of start:end pairs. The resulting DataFrame will handle any missing values (caused by differing lengths) as `NaN`."
