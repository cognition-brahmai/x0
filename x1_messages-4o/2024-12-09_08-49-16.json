        "content": "Certainly! Here's a simple Python program that accomplishes this task. It asks the user to input a number and then calculates and displays all the divisors of that number:\n\n```python\ndef find_divisors(number):\n    divisors = []\n    for i in range(1, number + 1):\n        if number % i == 0:\n            divisors.append(i)\n    return divisors\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        user_input = int(input(\"Please enter a number: \"))\n        if user_input <= 0:\n            print(\"Please enter a positive integer.\")\n        else:\n            divisors = find_divisors(user_input)\n            print(f\"The divisors of {user_input} are: {divisors}\")\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a valid integer.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### How it works:\n1. The program defines a function `find_divisors` that takes a number as an argument and returns a list of its divisors.\n2. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a number.\n3. It checks if the input is a positive integer and proceeds to find and print the list of divisors.\n4. If the input is invalid or not a positive integer, the program will prompt the user to enter a valid number.\n\nYou can run this program in any Python environment. It will handle user input and output the divisors of the provided number."
