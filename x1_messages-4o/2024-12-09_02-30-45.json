        "content": "In Python, using the `unittest.mock` library (which is part of the standard library and an evolution of the voidspace mock library), you can indeed set a `side_effect` on a property to simulate raising an exception. This involves a bit of trickery since properties are accessed directly rather than called like methods, but you can achieve this by using `PropertyMock`.\n\nHere's how you can configure your mock to raise a `DoesNotExist` exception when accessing the `shop` property:\n\n```python\nfrom unittest.mock import Mock, PropertyMock, patch\n\n# Assume Shop.DoesNotExist is an exception defined somewhere\nclass Shop:\n    class DoesNotExist(Exception):\n        pass\n\n# Mocking the user and request objects\nmock_user = Mock()\nmock_request = Mock(user=mock_user)\n\n# Using PropertyMock to set a side_effect on the property\nwith patch('path.to.your.Shop', new_callable=PropertyMock) as mock_shop:\n    mock_shop.side_effect = Shop.DoesNotExist\n\n    # Your class instance or function that uses `self.request.user.shop`\n    instance = YourClass()\n    instance.request = mock_request\n\n    # Now calling the method should handle the `DoesNotExist` exception\n    result = instance.get_object()\n    print(result)  # This should print `None` as per your implementation\n```\n\nIn this setup, you replace `path.to.your.Shop` with the actual import path to the `Shop` class. This `PropertyMock` approach allows you to set `side_effect` on a property, simulating the behavior you want to test. When `instance.get_object()` is called, accessing `self.request.user.shop` will trigger the `DoesNotExist` exception, and your code will handle it as expected."
