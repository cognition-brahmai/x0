However, the default `__repr__` for a Series only returns a condensed sample with some head and tail values, while the rest are missing. Is there a built-in method to pretty-print the whole Series or DataFrame? Ideally, I would like a method that supports proper alignment, possibly borders between columns, and maybe even color-coding for different columns."

        "content": "When working with pandas Series and DataFrames in the terminal, the default `__repr__` can indeed truncate the output if the data is large. However, there are several ways to display the entire Series or DataFrame with better formatting:\n\n1. **Display the whole Series or DataFrame**:\n   You can use the `to_string()` method to print out the entire Series or DataFrame without truncation:\n\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n\n   # For a Series\n   series.to_string()\n\n   # For a DataFrame\n   dataframe.to_string()\n   ```\n\n2. **Adjust pandas display options**:\n   You can change the display options in pandas to control how much of the DataFrame or Series is shown:\n\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n\n   # Set the maximum number of rows and columns to display\n   pd.set_option('display.max_rows', None)\n   pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)\n   ```\n\n3. **Pretty-printing with borders and alignment**:\n   For a more visually appealing output, you can use the `tabulate` library, which provides options for different table formats:\n\n   ```python\n   from tabulate import tabulate\n\n   # For a DataFrame\n   print(tabulate(dataframe, headers='keys', tablefmt='grid'))\n   ```\n\n   You can install the `tabulate` library via pip if you haven't already:\n   ```\n   pip install tabulate\n   ```\n\n4. **Color-coding with the `styler`**:\n   While color-coding is not natively supported in plain text terminals, you can use pandas `Styler` for HTML output, which can be rendered in Jupyter notebooks or saved as an HTML file:\n\n   ```python\n   # For a DataFrame\n   styled = dataframe.style.applymap(lambda x: 'background-color: yellow' if x > some_value else '')\n   styled.to_html('styled_dataframe.html')\n   ```\n\n   This won't be visible in a plain terminal but is great for visual analysis in environments that support HTML rendering.\n\nBy using these methods, you can achieve better alignment, visibility, and even aesthetics for your Series and DataFrames when working in the terminal or compatible environments."
