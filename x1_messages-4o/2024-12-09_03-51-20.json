        "content": "In Django, if you want to retrieve all permissions for a user as a list of permission IDs, you can achieve this by directly querying the `Permission` model. The `user.get_all_permissions()` method indeed provides permission names, which are strings in the format `\"<app_label>.<permission_codename>\"`. To get the IDs, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Import the necessary model from `django.contrib.auth.models`.\n2. Use the `user.user_permissions.all()` method to get the direct permissions of the user.\n3. If the user is a part of certain groups, you'll also need to retrieve permissions from those groups.\n4. Combine both sets of permissions and extract their IDs.\n\nHere's a code snippet that demonstrates how to achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import Permission\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User\n\ndef get_user_permission_ids(user):\n    # Get direct user permissions\n    direct_permissions = user.user_permissions.all()\n\n    # Get group permissions\n    group_permissions = Permission.objects.filter(group__user=user)\n\n    # Combine both sets of permissions\n    all_permissions = direct_permissions | group_permissions\n\n    # Extract permission IDs\n    permission_ids = list(all_permissions.values_list('id', flat=True))\n\n    return permission_ids\n\n# Usage\nuser = User.objects.get(username='your_username')\npermission_ids = get_user_permission_ids(user)\nprint(permission_ids)\n```\n\nThis function will return a list of permission IDs that the specified user has, including both direct and group-based permissions. This approach ensures you capture all permissions associated with the user."
