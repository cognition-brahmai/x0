        "content": "The error you're encountering is likely due to a mismatch between the versions of TensorFlow and the Object Detection API you are using. The TensorFlow Object Detection API often depends on specific versions of TensorFlow, and changes in API functions can lead to such errors.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Compatibility**: First, ensure that the version of TensorFlow you are using is compatible with the version of the Object Detection API. TensorFlow 1.x versions have specific Object Detection API versions that they work best with. You might need to downgrade TensorFlow to a compatible version.\n\n2. **Upgrade the Object Detection API**: If you want to use TensorFlow 1.5, you might need to update the Object Detection API to the latest version that supports TensorFlow 1.5. You can do this by pulling the latest code from the TensorFlow Models GitHub repository.\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git\n   cd models/research\n   protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.\n   ```\n\n3. **Modify the Code**: If updating the API is not an option, you can modify the source code to remove or replace the `dct_method` argument. This might involve editing the `tf_example_decoder.py` file and removing `dct_method=dct_method`.\n\n4. **Use a Virtual Environment**: It's a good practice to set up a virtual environment for your project. This way, you can easily manage dependencies and switch between different environments if needed.\n\n5. **Consult Documentation**: Refer to the TensorFlow Object Detection API documentation for any specific instructions on setting up and potential compatibility notes.\n\n6. **Check Community Forums**: Look for any similar issues raised in TensorFlow's GitHub issues section or forums like Stack Overflow. Often, others might have faced similar issues, and there could be existing solutions.\n\nBy ensuring compatibility between TensorFlow and the Object Detection API, and possibly making some code adjustments, you should be able to resolve the error and proceed with training your custom object detection model."
