However, when I tried a more complicated example with `y = [1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100]`, the output for 11 was `99`. I was expecting a quadratic function (x^2) to be returned, but it seems like the code is trying to find a linear function to map all the examples. How can I modify my code so that it can consider quadratic, cubic and other functions?\n\nHere's my code:\n```python\nfrom sklearn import linear_model\nimport numpy as np\n\nX = [[1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7],[8],[9],[10]]\ny = [2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]\n\nclf = linear_model.LinearRegression()\nclf.fit (X, y)\n\nprint(clf.predict([11])) # returns 22\n```"

        "content": "In your initial code, you're using linear regression, which is designed to find a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable. This is why you're getting a linear prediction even when you expect a quadratic relationship. To address this, you can use polynomial regression, which is a form of linear regression that can model non-linear relationships by transforming the input features into polynomial features.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use polynomial regression with scikit-learn:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Input data\nX = np.array([[1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7],[8],[9],[10]])\ny = [1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100]\n\n# Transform the features into polynomial features\ndegree = 2  # For quadratic\npoly = PolynomialFeatures(degree)\nX_poly = poly.fit_transform(X)\n\n# Fit the polynomial regression model\nmodel = LinearRegression()\nmodel.fit(X_poly, y)\n\n# Predict for new data\nX_new = np.array([[11]])\nX_new_poly = poly.transform(X_new)\nprediction = model.predict(X_new_poly)\n\nprint(prediction)  # Should be closer to 121 if the relationship is quadratic\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **PolynomialFeatures**: This is used to generate a new feature matrix consisting of all polynomial combinations of the features with degree less than or equal to the specified degree. For a quadratic relationship, you use `degree=2`.\n\n2. **LinearRegression**: After transforming the input features, you still use `LinearRegression` to fit the model. The transformed features allow it to model non-linear relationships.\n\n3. **Prediction**: You transform the new input data using the same polynomial transformation before making predictions.\n\nThis approach allows the model to capture the quadratic relationship in your data, and the prediction for `11` should be closer to `121`, assuming a quadratic relationship `y = x^2`. You can adjust the `degree` parameter to model cubic or even higher-degree polynomial relationships if needed."
