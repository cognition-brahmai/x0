        "content": "In the context of functional programming, what exactly is meant by \"partial function\"? My current understanding is that partial functions are derived by passing fewer parameters to a function than expected. As an example, if we were to directly apply this concept in Python:\n\n```python\n>>> def add(x,y):\n...    return x+y\n... \n>>> new_function = add(1)\n>>> new_function(2)\n3\n```\n\nIn the above example, `new_function` is considered a partial function. However, as per the Haskell Wiki, a partial function is defined as \"a function that is not defined for all possible arguments of the specified type.\" Can you clarify this concept?"

        "content": "Certainly! The term \"partial function\" can have different meanings depending on the context in which it is used, particularly in functional programming versus mathematics.\n\n1. **Mathematical Context**: In mathematics, a partial function is a function that is not defined for all possible inputs of its domain. For instance, the square root function is only defined for non-negative numbers in the set of real numbers. If you attempt to take the square root of a negative number, the function is not defined. This is what the Haskell Wiki is referring to: a partial function in this sense is one that does not provide an output for every input in its domain.\n\n2. **Functional Programming Context (Currying and Partial Application)**: In functional programming, the term \"partial function\" can refer to the concept of partial application, where you create a new function by fixing some of the arguments of an existing function. This is what your Python example illustrates:\n\n   ```python\n   from functools import partial\n\n   def add(x, y):\n       return x + y\n\n   new_function = partial(add, 1)\n   print(new_function(2))  # Outputs: 3\n   ```\n\n   In this context, `new_function` is a partially applied function, meaning that it is derived from the `add` function by \"fixing\" one of its arguments. This is a common technique in functional programming languages, where you often create new functions by pre-filling some of the arguments of existing functions.\n\nSo, while both uses of the term \"partial function\" are valid, they apply to different concepts. In mathematics, a partial function might not be defined for all inputs, while in functional programming, partial application involves fixing some arguments of a function to create a new function. Your Python example is an illustration of the latter concept."
