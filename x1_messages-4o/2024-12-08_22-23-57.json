Can you provide me with the necessary MATLAB code to extract the largest non-repeated number from this list? Furthermore, could you offer any alternative approaches to identify the maximum value that differs from the conventional method?"

        "content": "To locate the highest non-repeated value within an array in MATLAB, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify unique elements in the array.\n2. Count the occurrences of each element.\n3. Select elements that occur only once.\n4. Find the maximum of these elements.\n\nHere's a MATLAB code snippet that performs this operation:\n\n```matlab\n% Define the array\narray = [2, 15, 3, 6, 7];\n\n% Find unique elements and their counts\n[uniqueValues, ~, idx] = unique(array);\ncounts = accumarray(idx, 1);\n\n% Select elements that occur only once\nnonRepeatedValues = uniqueValues(counts == 1);\n\n% Find the maximum non-repeated value\nif ~isempty(nonRepeatedValues)\n    maxNonRepeatedValue = max(nonRepeatedValues);\nelse\n    maxNonRepeatedValue = []; % In case there are no non-repeated values\nend\n\ndisp(maxNonRepeatedValue);\n```\n\n### Alternative Approaches:\n\n1. **Logical Indexing:**\n   - You can use logical indexing to filter out repeated elements and then find the maximum.\n\n```matlab\n% Count occurrences of each element\ncounts = histc(array, unique(array));\n\n% Logical index for non-repeated elements\nnonRepeatedIndex = counts == 1;\n\n% Extract non-repeated elements\nnonRepeatedValues = array(nonRepeatedIndex);\n\n% Find the maximum\nif ~isempty(nonRepeatedValues)\n    maxNonRepeatedValue = max(nonRepeatedValues);\nelse\n    maxNonRepeatedValue = []; % In case there are no non-repeated values\nend\n\ndisp(maxNonRepeatedValue);\n```\n\n2. **Using `histcounts`:**\n   - Another method is to use `histcounts` for counting and filtering.\n\n```matlab\n% Count occurrences using histcounts\nedges = min(array):max(array);\n[counts, ~] = histcounts(array, edges);\n\n% Find non-repeated elements\nnonRepeatedValues = edges(counts == 1);\n\n% Find the maximum non-repeated value\nif ~isempty(nonRepeatedValues)\n    maxNonRepeatedValue = max(nonRepeatedValues);\nelse\n    maxNonRepeatedValue = []; % In case there are no non-repeated values\nend\n\ndisp(maxNonRepeatedValue);\n```\n\nThese methods provide different ways to achieve the same result, allowing you to choose based on your preference or specific application requirements."
