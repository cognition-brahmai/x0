        "content": "I am using the ProjectedGradientNMF method from the Sklearn package in Python to apply nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) on a large matrix. This method is supposed to decompose a given m by n matrix A into A = WH, where W is m by d and H is d by n. However, it seems that it only returns H, not W. Recomputing it with the transpose of A could give me W, but I want to avoid this as the matrix is large. How can I modify my code so that the algorithm returns both W and H simultaneously? Here is my current code:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import ProjectedGradientNMF\nimport numpy\nA = numpy.random.uniform(size = [40, 30])\nnmf_model = ProjectedGradientNMF(n_components = 5, init='random', random_state=0)\nnmf_model.fit(A)\nH = nmf_model.components_.T\n```"

        "content": "The `ProjectedGradientNMF` method from `sklearn.decomposition` is actually deprecated as of version 0.22, and you should use the `NMF` class instead. This class allows you to obtain both `W` and `H` matrices more easily. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import NMF\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Generate a random matrix A\nA = np.random.uniform(size=[40, 30])\n\n# Initialize the NMF model\nnmf_model = NMF(n_components=5, init='random', random_state=0)\n\n# Fit the model to the data\nW = nmf_model.fit_transform(A)\n\n# Get the H matrix\nH = nmf_model.components_\n\n# W is now the (m x d) matrix and H is the (d x n) matrix\nprint(\"Matrix W (40x5):\")\nprint(W)\nprint(\"\\nMatrix H (5x30):\")\nprint(H)\n```\n\nIn this updated code, `fit_transform` is used to compute the matrix `W`, and `components_` provides the matrix `H`. This approach is efficient and avoids the need to transpose the matrix."
