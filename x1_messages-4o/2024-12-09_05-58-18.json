I understand the formula to calculate the distance is `dist = sqrt((ax-bx)^2 + (ay-by)^2 + (az-bz)^2)`. How can I implement this using NumPy? So far, I have imported numpy and created numpy arrays for my points as follows: \n\n```python\nimport numpy\na = numpy.array((ax, ay, az))\nb = numpy.array((bx, by, bz))\n```"

Since you've already imported NumPy and created arrays for your points, you can proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. Subtract one point from the other to get the difference vector.\n2. Calculate the square of each component of the difference vector.\n3. Sum the squared components.\n4. Take the square root of the sum to get the Euclidean distance.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array((ax, ay, az))\nb = np.array((bx, by, bz))\n\n# Calculate the difference vector\ndifference = a - b\n\n# Calculate the Euclidean distance\ndistance = np.sqrt(np.sum(difference**2))\n\nprint(distance)\n```\n\nThis code will output the Euclidean distance between the points `a` and `b`. The `np.sqrt()` function is used to compute the square root, and `np.sum()` adds up the squared differences. This approach leverages NumPy's ability to perform element-wise operations efficiently."
