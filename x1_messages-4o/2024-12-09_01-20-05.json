I understand how to delete a single column, but I don't know how to preserve a select few and delete everything else. Can you guide me on how I can do this with pandas?"

        "content": "Certainly! In pandas, you can easily select specific columns from a DataFrame and discard the rest by using the `loc` or `iloc` indexer, or simply by passing a list of column names you want to retain. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\nSuppose your DataFrame is named `df`. To keep only columns 3 and 5, you can do the following:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame creation\ndata = {'1': ['x', 'x', 'x'],\n        '2': ['x', 'x', 'x'],\n        '3': ['x', 'x', 'x'],\n        '4': ['x', 'x', 'x'],\n        '5': ['x', 'x', 'x'],\n        '6': ['x', 'x', 'x']}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data, index=['A', 'B', 'C'])\n\n# Selecting only columns '3' and '5'\ndf_reduced = df[['3', '5']]\n\nprint(df_reduced)\n```\n\nThis code will create a new DataFrame `df_reduced` that contains only the columns '3' and '5'. The `[['3', '5']]` syntax is used to select the desired columns. Note that the column labels are given as strings, so ensure that you are providing them in the correct format as they appear in your DataFrame."
