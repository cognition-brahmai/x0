Everything works well except for the fact that the content logged to the logging framework is not captured by the \"Captured output\" of PyDev. I have already set up my logging to forward everything to the standard output, but \"Captured output\" still doesn't display the logs. How can I capture everything that is logged to a logging.Logger during the execution of a unittest in PyDev?\n\nHere is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport unittest\nimport logging\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger()\nlogger.level = logging.DEBUG\nlogger.addHandler(logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout))\n\nclass TestCase(unittest.TestCase):\n    def testSimpleMsg(self):\n        print(\"AA\")\n        logging.getLogger().info(\"BB\")\n```\n\nThe console output is:\n\n```\nFinding files... done.\nImporting test modules ... done.\n\ntestSimpleMsg (itf.lowlevel.tests.hl7.TestCase) ... AA\n2011-09-19 16:48:00,755 - root - INFO - BB\nBB\nok\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nRan 1 test in 0.001s\n\nOK\n```\n\nBut the CAPTURED OUTPUT for the test is:\n\n```\n======================== CAPTURED OUTPUT =========================\nAA\n```"

        "content": "To capture logging output in PyDev's \"Captured output\" section during unittest execution, ensure that the logging configuration is correctly set up to integrate with the unittest framework's output capturing mechanism. Here are a few steps and tips to help you achieve this:\n\n1. **Configure Logging Properly**: Make sure your logging is correctly set up to propagate messages, and that you are using a handler that outputs to a stream that unittest captures, such as `sys.stdout`.\n\n2. **Use `unittest.TestCase`'s `setUp` and `tearDown` Methods**: You can override these methods to set up your logging configuration before each test and tear it down afterward. This ensures that each test runs with the same logging configuration.\n\n3. **Use `unittest`'s `TextTestRunner`**: Ensure that you are using the correct test runner when executing your tests. PyDev should be configured to use a runner that captures standard output.\n\nHere's an updated version of your code that includes these suggestions:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport unittest\nimport logging\n\nclass TestCase(unittest.TestCase):\n    \n    @classmethod\n    def setUpClass(cls):\n        # Set up logging only once for this test class\n        cls.logger = logging.getLogger('TestLogger')\n        cls.logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n        handler = logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)\n        formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n        handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n        cls.logger.addHandler(handler)\n        cls.logger.propagate = True\n\n    def testSimpleMsg(self):\n        print(\"AA\")\n        self.logger.info(\"BB\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\n### Additional Tips:\n\n- **Check PyDev Settings**: Ensure that PyDev is configured to capture standard output and error streams. This can typically be set in the PyDev preferences under `Run/Debug > Console`.\n\n- **Custom Stream Handlers**: If needed, create a custom stream handler that explicitly writes to `sys.stdout` or `sys.stderr`. This can sometimes help if default handlers do not work as expected.\n\nBy ensuring that the logger is set up properly and that PyDev is configured to capture output, you should be able to see the logged messages within PyDev's captured output section."
