        "content": "I have recently transitioned to Python 3 and I've noticed that the function `xrange` is not available. This is causing my code to run slower than expected. For instance, when I run the following Python 2 code:\n\n```python\nfrom time import time as t\ndef count():\n  st = t()\n  [x for x in xrange(10000000) if x%4 == 0]\n  et = t()\n  print et-st\ncount()\n```\n\nThe result I get is `1.53888392448`. However, when I try to mimic the same functionality in Python 3 with this code:\n\n```python\nfrom time import time as t\n\ndef xrange(x):\n    return iter(range(x))\n\ndef count():\n    st = t()\n    [x for x in xrange(10000000) if x%4 == 0]\n    et = t()\n    print (et-st)\ncount()\n```\n\nThe result I get is `3.215819835662842`, which is slower. I am not able to find the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) that explains the removal of `xrange`. Can someone explain why `xrange` was removed in Python 3 and guide me to the corresponding PEP?"

        "content": "In Python 3, `xrange` was removed and `range` was redesigned to behave like `xrange` from Python 2. This means that in Python 3, `range` returns an immutable sequence type, which is more memory efficient, as it does not generate the entire list of numbers at once, similar to what `xrange` did in Python 2.\n\nThe decision to remove `xrange` and improve `range` was aimed at simplifying the language by reducing redundancy, as having two functions that perform similar tasks was deemed unnecessary.\n\nThe relevant discussion about this change can be found in PEP 3100, which is the \"Python 3000\" project plan. Although it doesn\u2019t provide detailed reasoning for every change, it lists the removal of `xrange` as part of the cleanup and simplification processes for Python 3.\n\nHere's a link to PEP 3100: [PEP 3100](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3100/)\n\nRegarding the performance difference you're observing, it's important to note a few things:\n\n1. **List comprehension timing**: The slower performance could be due to the list comprehension `[x for x in range(10000000) if x%4 == 0]` inherently taking longer due to different memory management or optimizations in Python 3.\n\n2. **Timing differences**: The timing discrepancies can also arise from differences in the Python 2 and Python 3 interpreters, or from different implementations of internal optimizations.\n\n3. **Python 3 improvements**: Ensure that you're using the latest Python 3 version, as there have been significant improvements in performance over the various releases.\n\nTo optimize performance in your Python 3 code, you could try using generator expressions where possible, or explore other optimizations depending on your specific use case."
