It involves calculating the total seconds between the two dates and then converting those seconds into full days by dividing by the number of seconds in a day (86,400 seconds) and using `math.floor` to get the whole number of days.\n\nHowever, there is a simpler and more Pythonic way to achieve the same result by directly using the `timedelta` object from the `datetime` module. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Example dates\na = datetime(2023, 10, 1)\nb = datetime(2023, 10, 15)\n\n# Calculate the difference in full days\nfull_days = (b - a).days\n\nprint(full_days)\n```\n\nWith this approach, you use the `.days` attribute of the `timedelta` object (which is the result of `b - a`) to directly get the number of full days between the two dates, making the code more concise and readable."
