        "content": "The \"ValueError: Circular reference detected\" error occurs when you attempt to serialize an object that contains a reference to itself, directly or indirectly. In your case, this is likely happening because of an issue with the data structure you're trying to serialize or the way you're handling the database cursor.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to address this issue and improve your code:\n\n1. **Cursor Management**: Make sure you open and close the cursor properly to avoid any issues with lingering references. Use a context manager (`with` statement) to ensure the cursor is closed automatically.\n\n2. **SQL Query**: Use parameterized queries, which are safer and help prevent SQL injection attacks.\n\n3. **Date Handling**: Your `date_handler` function seems appropriate, but let's make sure it only applies to `datetime` objects.\n\nHere is a refactored version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport datetime\n\ndef date_handler(obj):\n    if isinstance(obj, datetime.datetime):\n        return obj.isoformat()\n    raise TypeError(f\"Type {type(obj)} not serializable\")\n\ndef get_products_json(best_matching_codes, db):\n    products_json = []\n\n    with db.cursor() as cur:\n        for product_code in best_matching_codes:\n            query = \"SELECT * FROM %s WHERE code LIKE %%s\" % PRODUCTS_TABLE_NAME\n            cur.execute(query, (product_code,))\n            columns = [desc[0] for desc in cur.description]\n            rows = cur.fetchall()\n\n            for row in rows:\n                products_json.append(dict(zip(columns, row)))\n\n    return json.dumps(products_json, default=date_handler)\n\n# Example usage\n# best_matching_codes = ['some_code1', 'some_code2']\n# db = your_database_connection\n# print(get_products_json(best_matching_codes, db))\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Parameterized Queries**: Use `%s` for placeholders in the SQL query, and pass values as a tuple to `cur.execute()`. This prevents SQL injection.\n\n- **Context Manager for Cursor**: The `with db.cursor() as cur` ensures that the cursor is closed after the block is executed, which can help prevent circular references.\n\n- **Error Handling**: Raise a `TypeError` in `date_handler` if an unsupported type is encountered, which makes debugging easier.\n\n- **Ensure Correct Code Usage**: Make sure that `best_matching_codes` and `db` are defined and passed to the function correctly.\n\nThis should resolve your issue and improve the robustness and security of your code."
