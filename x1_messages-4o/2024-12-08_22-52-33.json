Let's start by identifying possible titles from the letter pool:\n\n- **Hansel and Gretel**: Not possible due to letter constraints.\n- **The Frog Prince**: Not possible due to letter constraints.\n- **Rapunzel**: Uses letters from SPUN.\n- **Little Red Riding Hood**: Not possible due to letter constraints.\n- **Cinderella**: Not possible due to letter constraints.\n\nFrom the given options, the letters can be rearranged to form the title **\"Rapunzel\"**. \n\nNow, let's query the provided SQL table to find the impact on cultural zeitgeist for the story \"Rapunzel\":\n\n```sql\nSELECT \"Impact on Cultural Zeitgeist\"\nFROM Brothers_Grimm_Stories\nWHERE \"Story Title\" = 'Rapunzel';\n```\n\nAccording to the table, the impact on cultural zeitgeist for \"Rapunzel\" is **Low**.\n\nTherefore, the story title is \"Rapunzel\" and its impact on the cultural zeitgeist is Low."
