Here is a simple code snippet to achieve that:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nrandom_number = random.randint(1, 10)\nprint(\"Random number between 1 and 10:\", random_number)\n```\n\nThis code utilizes the `randint` function from the `random` module, which returns a random integer between the two specified numbers, inclusive."
