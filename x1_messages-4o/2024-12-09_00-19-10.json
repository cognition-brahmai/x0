However, when I run this command `pyenv virtualenv 3.8.2 torch`, it fails with `pyenv: no such command 'virtualenv'`. How can I resolve this? I have already installed `virtualenv` and `pyenv` as indicated in my terminal."

        "content": "It seems like the `pyenv-virtualenv` plugin, which allows you to create virtual environments using `pyenv`, is not installed. The error message indicates that `pyenv` is unable to recognize the `virtualenv` command, which typically means that the plugin is missing. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Install `pyenv-virtualenv`:**\n\n   First, make sure you have the `pyenv-virtualenv` plugin installed. You can do this by cloning the repository into the `plugins` directory of `pyenv`:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv.git ~/.pyenv/plugins/pyenv-virtualenv\n   ```\n\n2. **Update your shell configuration:**\n\n   Make sure to add `pyenv` and `pyenv-virtualenv` to your shell startup script so that they are available in your terminal sessions. This could be `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, etc., depending on which shell you are using. Add the following lines if they are not already present:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=\"$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH\"\n   eval \"$(pyenv init --path)\"\n   eval \"$(pyenv init -)\"\n   eval \"$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Restart your shell:**\n\n   After making changes to your shell configuration, restart your terminal session or source the configuration file to apply the changes:\n\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bashrc\n   ```\n\n   or\n\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.zshrc\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify Installation:**\n\n   You can verify that `pyenv-virtualenv` is installed correctly by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   pyenv virtualenvs\n   ```\n\n   This command should list any virtual environments you have, and it will confirm that `pyenv-virtualenv` is working.\n\n5. **Create the Virtual Environment Again:**\n\n   Now you should be able to create a virtual environment using:\n\n   ```bash\n   pyenv virtualenv 3.8.2 torch\n   ```\n\nIf you face any further issues, ensure that `pyenv` itself is correctly installed and functioning by checking your `pyenv` version with `pyenv --version` and ensuring it outputs a version number. If there are any discrepancies, you might need to revisit the installation steps for `pyenv` as well."
