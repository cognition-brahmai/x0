        "content": "The `plt.figure()` function in Matplotlib is used to create a new figure object, which serves as a container for all the plots and subplots you want to create. Here's a breakdown of its necessity and functionality:\n\n1. **Creating a New Figure**: When you call `plt.figure()`, it initializes a new figure. This is important if you are planning to create multiple plots in the same script or if you want to customize the size and properties of your plot independently of others. Without explicitly calling `plt.figure()`, Matplotlib might use the default figure, which may not have the desired properties, especially if you have multiple plots.\n\n2. **Customizing Figure Properties**: The `figsize` parameter allows you to specify the width and height of the figure in inches. In your code, `figsize=(10, 8)` is setting the figure to be 10 inches wide and 8 inches tall. This can be important for ensuring that your plot has enough space for all elements like labels, titles, and legends without being cramped.\n\n3. **Managing Multiple Figures**: If you want to create multiple figures in a single script (for example, in a loop or a function), calling `plt.figure()` helps manage these figures separately. Each call to `plt.figure()` creates a new figure object, which you can then plot on independently.\n\nIn your context, using `plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))` is helpful to ensure that the scatterplot has the appropriate size and is managed separately from other potential plots. It also gives you the flexibility to add more subplots or adjust the layout if needed. While not always strictly necessary if you're only making one simple plot, it's a good practice to include it to maintain clarity and control over your plotting environment, especially in more complex scripts."
