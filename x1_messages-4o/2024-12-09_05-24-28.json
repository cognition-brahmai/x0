I am trying to create a function that adds entries to a JSON file, and I want my file to look something like this:\n\n<pre><code>[{\"name\" = \"name1\", \"url\" = \"url1\"}, {\"name\" = \"name2\", \"url\" = \"url2\"}]\n</code></pre>\n\nThe function I have written creates an entry such as `{\"name\"=\"some name\", \"url\"=\"some url\"}`. But, if I use this `add` function again, with a different name and URL, the first entry is being overwritten. How can I append a second entry to the first one without overwriting? Here is the code for the function I have:\n\n<pre><code>def add(args):\n    with open(DATA_FILENAME, mode='r', encoding='utf-8') as feedsjson:\n        feeds = json.load(feedsjson)\n    with open(DATA_FILENAME, mode='w', encoding='utf-8') as feedsjson:\n        entry = {}\n        entry['name'] = args.name\n        entry['url'] = args.url\n        json.dump(entry, feedsjson)\n</code></pre>\n\nI tried to modify my function to use the `feeds` in the write block, but it seems to not be working:\n\n<pre><code>with open(DATA_FILENAME, mode='a+', encoding='utf-8') as feedsjson:\n    feeds = json.load(feedsjson)\n    entry = {}\n    entry['name'] = args.name\n    entry['url'] = args.url\n    json.dump(entry, feeds)\n</code></pre>"

        "content": "To append data to a JSON file without overwriting the existing entries, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Read the existing data** from the JSON file.\n2. **Append the new entry** to the existing data.\n3. **Write the updated data** back to the JSON file.\n\nYour current approach has a few issues, such as incorrect use of the append mode (`a+`) and the way you're handling the JSON data. Here's how you can fix it:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\nDATA_FILENAME = 'data.json'\n\ndef add(args):\n    try:\n        # Step 1: Read the existing data from the JSON file\n        with open(DATA_FILENAME, mode='r', encoding='utf-8') as feedsjson:\n            try:\n                feeds = json.load(feedsjson)\n            except json.JSONDecodeError:\n                # If the file is empty or contains invalid JSON, start with an empty list\n                feeds = []\n\n        # Step 2: Append the new entry to the existing list of feeds\n        entry = {\n            'name': args.name,\n            'url': args.url\n        }\n        feeds.append(entry)\n\n        # Step 3: Write the updated list back to the JSON file\n        with open(DATA_FILENAME, mode='w', encoding='utf-8') as feedsjson:\n            json.dump(feeds, feedsjson, indent=2)\n\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        # If the file doesn't exist, create it and add the first entry\n        with open(DATA_FILENAME, mode='w', encoding='utf-8') as feedsjson:\n            feeds = [entry]\n            json.dump(feeds, feedsjson, indent=2)\n\n# Example usage\nclass Args:\n    def __init__(self, name, url):\n        self.name = name\n        self.url = url\n\nadd(Args(\"name1\", \"url1\"))\nadd(Args(\"name2\", \"url2\"))\n```\n\n### Key Changes and Explanations:\n\n- **Reading the file**: Use `mode='r'` for reading. If the file is empty or contains invalid JSON, handle it gracefully by initializing `feeds` as an empty list.\n- **Appending data**: Add the new entry to the list of feeds.\n- **Writing the file**: Use `mode='w'` to overwrite the file with the updated data. The `indent=2` parameter is used for pretty-printing, making the JSON file more readable.\n- **Error handling**: Handle `FileNotFoundError` to create the file if it doesn't exist when you try to read it for the first time.\n\nThis approach ensures that each call to the `add` function appends a new entry to the JSON file without overwriting the existing entries."
