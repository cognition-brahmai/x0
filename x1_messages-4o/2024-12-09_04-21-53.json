How can I achieve that?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired sorting order, you need to adjust the sorting key and the use of the `reverse` parameter in the `sorted()` function. You want to sort the tuples first by the second element in descending order, and then by the first element in ascending order when the second elements are the same.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Your list of tuples\nmy_list = [('B', 3), ('A', 2), ('A', 1), ('I', 1), ('J', 1)]\n\n# Sort by the second element in descending order, then by the first element in ascending order\nsorted_list = sorted(my_list, key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))\n\n# Print the sorted list\nprint(sorted_list)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0])`: This lambda function specifies the sorting key. `-x[1]` is used to sort by the second element in descending order, and `x[0]` is used to sort by the first element in ascending order if the second elements are the same.\n- By using a negative sign before `x[1]`, we achieve descending order for the second element without needing to use the `reverse=True` parameter in the `sorted()` function.\n\nThis will give you the expected result:\n\n```python\n[('B', 3), ('A', 2), ('A', 1), ('I', 1), ('J', 1)]\n```"
