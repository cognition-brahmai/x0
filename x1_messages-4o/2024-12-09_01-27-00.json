Specifically, I want to find a more succinct way to express \"Give me dict['foo'] if it exists, and if not, give me this other value bar\". Normally for objects, I would use getattr(obj, 'foo', bar) but it raises a KeyError when I use it with a dictionary. In JavaScript or CoffeeScript, I would write dict['foo'] || bar but it also yields a KeyError in Python. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "In Python, you can achieve the equivalent functionality for dictionaries using the `dict.get()` method. This method allows you to specify a default value that will be returned if the specified key does not exist in the dictionary. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nvalue = my_dict.get('foo', bar)\n```\n\nIn this example, `my_dict.get('foo', bar)` will return `my_dict['foo']` if the key `'foo'` exists in the dictionary. If the key does not exist, it will return the value of `bar` instead. This is similar to how `getattr` works for objects, and it does not raise a `KeyError`."
