But here's the catch, your code should only consider a statement as sarcastic if it has a minimum of 15 words and ends with a period instead of an exclamation mark. Additionally, your code should also count the number of sarcastic statements present in the passage and return it. \nFor example, consider the passage: \"Oh great, another Monday morning. I just can't wait to start the day!\" The function should return a count of 1 sarcastic statement. Can you handle this challenge?"

        "content": "Sure, I can help with that. To tackle this challenge, we'll need to use a machine learning model specifically trained for sarcasm detection. However, for simplicity and due to the unavailability of a pretrained sarcasm detection model without extensive data and training, let's create a basic example using a rule-based approach. This won't be perfect but will follow your criteria.\n\nBelow is a Python code example that uses basic text processing to identify potentially sarcastic statements based on word count and punctuation. For more accurate sarcasm detection, a proper NLP model is recommended.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef is_sarcastic(statement):\n    # Check if the statement is sarcastic based on given conditions\n    statement = statement.strip()\n    \n    # Check if the statement has at least 15 words and ends with a period\n    if len(statement.split()) >= 15 and statement.endswith('.'):\n        # Here, we can add further checks for sarcasm detection\n        # For simplicity, let's assume a basic keyword check for common sarcasm indicators\n        sarcasm_indicators = ['great', 'wonderful', 'amazing', 'perfect']\n        words = statement.lower().split()\n        if any(word in words for word in sarcasm_indicators):\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef count_sarcastic_statements(passage):\n    # Split the passage into sentences\n    sentences = re.split(r'(?<=[.!?]) +', passage)\n    \n    # Count the number of sarcastic statements\n    sarcastic_count = sum(is_sarcastic(sentence) for sentence in sentences)\n    \n    return sarcastic_count\n\n# Example usage\npassage = \"Oh great, another Monday morning. I just can't wait to start the day!\"\nsarcastic_count = count_sarcastic_statements(passage)\nprint(f\"The passage contains {sarcastic_count} sarcastic statement(s).\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Statement Check:** The function `is_sarcastic` checks if a statement contains at least 15 words and ends with a period. Additionally, it looks for certain keywords that may imply sarcasm.\n2. **Count Sarcastic Statements:** The function `count_sarcastic_statements` splits the passage into sentences and counts how many of these sentences are considered sarcastic based on the criteria.\n\nThis is a simple rule-based approach and may not be highly accurate. For a more precise solution, consider training a sarcasm detection model using a dataset of sarcastic and non-sarcastic sentences, employing techniques like NLP with deep learning models (e.g., transformers), and using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch."
