An example of the div tags I am dealing with is given below:\n\n<div id=\"post-45\">...</div>\n<div id=\"post-334\">...</div>\n\nTo solve this, I have tried the following code:\n\n```python\nhtml = '<div id=\"post-45\">...</div> <div id=\"post-334\">...</div>'\nsoupHandler = BeautifulSoup(html)\nprint soupHandler.findAll('div', id='post-*')\n```\nBut I am unable to filter the div tags as I intended. How can I correctly filter these div tags using BeautifulSoup?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that the `findAll` method in BeautifulSoup does not support wildcard characters like `*` directly in its search parameters. However, you can use a regular expression to match the pattern of the `id` attribute you're interested in.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use a regular expression with BeautifulSoup:\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\nhtml = '<div id=\"post-45\">...</div> <div id=\"post-334\">...</div>'\nsoupHandler = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')\n\n# Use a regular expression to match the pattern 'post-#'\ndivs = soupHandler.find_all('div', id=re.compile(r'^post-\\d+$'))\n\nfor div in divs:\n    print(div)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `re.compile(r'^post-\\d+$')`: This regular expression matches strings that start with `post-` followed by one or more digits. \n  - `^` asserts the position at the start of a string.\n  - `post-` matches the literal string \"post-\".\n  - `\\d+` matches one or more digits.\n  - `$` asserts the position at the end of a string.\n\nUsing this regular expression with `id=re.compile(...)` allows you to filter `div` tags whose `id` attributes match the desired pattern."
