The model is running on the 10 million Movielens dataset and I am splitting the dataset into 80% training, 10% test and 10% validation. However, the recommendations provided by the model do not make sense. For instance, when I rate only kids movies, I get recommendations for completely unrelated movies. I have also tried training the model with different parameters and more factors but the results remain unsatisfactory. In contrast, when I use the implicit feedback method, I get much better results. Why are the results so poor with the explicit method?"

        "content": "When using Apache Spark's ALS (Alternating Least Squares) for collaborative filtering, the quality of recommendations can vary significantly based on various factors. Here's why you might be experiencing poor results with the explicit feedback method:\n\n1. **Data Sparsity**: The Movielens dataset, even at 10 million ratings, can still be sparse relative to the number of movies and users. Explicit feedback models often struggle with sparse datasets because they rely heavily on the available ratings.\n\n2. **Cold Start Problem**: If you're rating only a small subset of movies (like kids' movies), the model might not have enough data to accurately understand your preferences. ALS with explicit feedback can have difficulty making predictions for users with limited rating history.\n\n3. **Bias in Ratings**: Explicit feedback models are sensitive to the scale and distribution of ratings. If there are biases (e.g., users only rate movies they like, or ratings cluster around certain values), it can skew the recommendations.\n\n4. **Parameter Tuning**: While you mentioned trying different parameters, the explicit feedback method often requires careful tuning of hyperparameters such as rank (number of latent factors), regularization parameter, and number of iterations. It's possible that the model hasn't been optimally tuned yet.\n\n5. **Implicit Feedback Superiority**: Implicit feedback models consider the presence or absence of interactions, rather than explicit ratings. This can often lead to better results because they naturally handle the problem of interpreting \"missing\" ratings and can better leverage the complete interaction history.\n\n6. **Overfitting**: If the model is too complex (e.g., too many latent factors), it might overfit the training data, capturing noise rather than underlying patterns. This would result in poor recommendations.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to potentially improve the explicit feedback method:\n\n- **Experiment with Different Hyperparameters**: Systematically try different values for rank, regularization, and iterations using cross-validation.\n- **Preprocessing**: Consider normalizing or scaling the ratings, or using techniques to reduce sparsity.\n- **Feature Engineering**: Incorporate additional features (such as movie genres or user demographics) if possible.\n- **Blending Models**: Combine explicit and implicit feedback models to leverage the strengths of both.\n- **Data Augmentation**: Increase the diversity of ratings to provide more context for the model to learn from.\n\nUltimately, if implicit feedback is working well for your use case, it might be the more appropriate approach given the nature of your data and requirements."
