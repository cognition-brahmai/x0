I've written the following code for this:\n\n```python\nif x >= start and x <= end:\n    # do stuff\n```\nHowever, this code is underlined and I am getting a tooltip that tells me to \"simplify chained comparison\". I am unable to understand why this is happening as I believe this comparison is as simple as it can be. Can someone explain what I am missing here?"

In Python, you can perform chained comparisons in a more concise and readable way. Your current code:\n\n```python\nif x >= start and x <= end:\n    # do stuff\n```\n\ncan be simplified to:\n\n```python\nif start <= x <= end:\n    # do stuff\n```\n\nThis chained comparison is equivalent to the original code but is more idiomatic in Python. It checks if `x` is greater than or equal to `start` and less than or equal to `end` in a single expression. This is not only more concise but also easier to read, which is why you're getting the suggestion to simplify it."
