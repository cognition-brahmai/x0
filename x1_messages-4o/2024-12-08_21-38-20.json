        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find a missing number \\( x \\) such that the median of the set \\(\\{6, 7, 8, 9, x\\}\\) is equal to the mean of the set.\n\n1. **Median Calculation:**\n\n   - Since we will have five numbers in the set, the median will be the third number when the numbers are arranged in ascending order.\n\n2. **Mean Calculation:**\n\n   - The mean of the numbers is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Mean} = \\frac{6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + x}{5} = \\frac{30 + x}{5}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine Median Position:**\n\n   - To find the median, we need the third number after sorting. The position of \\( x \\) will determine the arrangement.\n\n4. **Possible Arrangements:**\n\n   - **Case 1:** If \\( x \\leq 6 \\), the sorted set is \\(\\{x, 6, 7, 8, 9\\}\\). The median is 7.\n   - **Case 2:** If \\( 6 < x \\leq 7 \\), the sorted set is \\(\\{6, x, 7, 8, 9\\}\\). The median is 7.\n   - **Case 3:** If \\( 7 < x \\leq 8 \\), the sorted set is \\(\\{6, 7, x, 8, 9\\}\\). The median is \\( x \\).\n   - **Case 4:** If \\( 8 < x \\leq 9 \\), the sorted set is \\(\\{6, 7, 8, x, 9\\}\\). The median is 8.\n   - **Case 5:** If \\( x > 9 \\), the sorted set is \\(\\{6, 7, 8, 9, x\\}\\). The median is 8.\n\n5. **Equating Median and Mean:**\n\n   - **For Case 3:** The median is \\( x \\). So, we set:\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{30 + x}{5}\n     \\]\n     Solving for \\( x \\):\n     \\[\n     5x = 30 + x \\\\\n     4x = 30 \\\\\n     x = 7.5\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the missing number that makes the median equal to the mean is \\( 7.5 \\)."
