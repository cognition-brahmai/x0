I discovered that when I call python when my virtualenv is activated, it still points to `/usr/bin/python` instead of `/home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots/bin/python`. When I use `which python` in the virtualenv, I get `/home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots/bin/python`. Also, when I check my `$PATH` variable in the virtualenv, it seems to be correct. However, when I actually run python it goes to `/usr/bin/python`. Strangely, if I run python3.5, it grabs python3.5 from the correct directory. I have not modified `/home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots/bin/` in any way. Both `python` and `python3.5` are still linked to `python3` in that directory. Also, running `./python`, `./python3` or `./python3.5` from `/home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots/bin/` works normally. I am using `virtualenvwrapper` and this problem seemed to occur recently, long after installing `virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper`. Could you help me resolve this?"

        "content": "Certainly! The issue you're experiencing with the virtual environment not using the expected Python interpreter can be perplexing, but it often boils down to configuration or path issues. Here are some steps to help you troubleshoot and potentially resolve the problem:\n\n1. **Verify Virtual Environment Activation:**\n   Ensure that your virtual environment is activated correctly. When activated, your shell prompt should reflect the virtual environment name. You can activate it using:\n   ```bash\n   source /home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Symlinks:**\n   Within your virtual environment's `bin` directory, verify that the symlinks for `python`, `python3`, and `python3.5` are pointing to the correct Python binaries. You can check this with:\n   ```bash\n   ls -l /home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots/bin/python*\n   ```\n\n3. **Ensure Correct Shebang:**\n   Check the shebang line (the first line starting with `#!`) of the `python` executable in your virtual environment. It should point to the Python binary within the environment:\n   ```bash\n   head -n 1 /home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots/bin/python\n   ```\n\n4. **Recreate the Virtual Environment:**\n   If there seems to be a persistent issue, sometimes it's easiest to recreate the virtual environment. Deactivate and remove the current one, and then create a new one:\n   ```bash\n   deactivate\n   rm -rf /home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots\n   mkvirtualenv noots\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify `virtualenvwrapper` Configuration:**\n   Ensure that `virtualenvwrapper` is properly set up in your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`). You should have lines similar to:\n   ```bash\n   export WORKON_HOME=~/dev/.virtualenvs\n   source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh\n   ```\n\n6. **Python Aliases:**\n   Check if there are any shell aliases that might be redirecting `python` to `/usr/bin/python` instead of the virtual environment's Python. You can view aliases with:\n   ```bash\n   alias\n   ```\n\n7. **Check for Shell Scripts or Environment Variables:**\n   Ensure that no shell scripts or environment variables in your setup are overriding the Python path. This includes checking for scripts that run on shell startup.\n\n8. **Consider Python Version Management Tools:**\n   If you're using tools like `pyenv`, ensure they're not interfering with the Python version in your virtual environment. You can temporarily disable such tools to see if it resolves the issue.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the problem with your virtual environment. If the issue persists, consider any recent changes to your system's Python configuration or updates that might have affected the setup."
