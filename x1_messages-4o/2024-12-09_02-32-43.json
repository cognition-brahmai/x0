        "content": "If you're looking for alternatives to `pylab` for plotting in Python and prefer libraries that do not use a stateful model, there are several options available:\n\n1. **Matplotlib (Object-Oriented API)**: While `pylab` is part of Matplotlib and uses a stateful interface similar to MATLAB, Matplotlib also offers a more flexible and explicit object-oriented API. You can create figures and axes explicitly and have more control over your plots.\n\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n   # Object-oriented API\n   fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n   ax.plot(x, y)\n   ax.set_title('Title')\n   ax.set_xlabel('X-axis')\n   ax.set_ylabel('Y-axis')\n   plt.show()\n   ```\n\n2. **Seaborn**: Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. It is more declarative and works well with Pandas DataFrames.\n\n   ```python\n   import seaborn as sns\n\n   sns.set_theme(style=\"darkgrid\")\n   sns.lineplot(x=x, y=y, data=data)\n   ```\n\n3. **Plotly**: An interactive plotting library that offers a high-level interface for creating rich visualizations. Plotly does not use a stateful model and allows for interactive plots that can be embedded in web applications.\n\n   ```python\n   import plotly.express as px\n\n   fig = px.line(df, x='x', y='y', title='Line Plot')\n   fig.show()\n   ```\n\n4. **Bokeh**: Designed for creating interactive plots, particularly in web browsers. Bokeh provides a powerful interface for creating complex plots and does not rely on a stateful model.\n\n   ```python\n   from bokeh.plotting import figure, show\n   from bokeh.io import output_notebook\n\n   output_notebook()\n   \n   p = figure(title=\"Line Plot\", x_axis_label='x', y_axis_label='y')\n   p.line(x, y, legend_label='Data', line_width=2)\n   show(p)\n   ```\n\n5. **Altair**: A declarative statistical visualization library based on Vega and Vega-Lite. Altair is great for creating concise and informative charts with less code.\n\n   ```python\n   import altair as alt\n   import pandas as pd\n\n   df = pd.DataFrame({'x': x, 'y': y})\n   chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_line().encode(\n       x='x',\n       y='y'\n   )\n   chart.show()\n   ```\n\n6. **ggplot (ggplot2 for Python)**: Inspired by ggplot2 from R, this library provides a grammar of graphics for Python. It allows for building plots in layers.\n\n   ```python\n   from plotnine import ggplot, aes, geom_line\n\n   df = pd.DataFrame({'x': x, 'y': y})\n   plot = ggplot(df, aes(x='x', y='y')) + geom_line()\n   print(plot)\n   ```\n\nEach of these libraries has its own strengths and is suited to different types of plotting tasks, so the best choice depends on your specific needs and preferences."
