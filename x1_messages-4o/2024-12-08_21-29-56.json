        "content": "You have decided to take a road trip from New York to Los Angeles, but you want to make it a challenge by figuring out the most cost-effective mode of transportation. You have three options: driving your car, taking a flight, or riding a bus. However, there are some rules you need to follow to make the decision-making process more interesting.\nRule 1: The cost of gas will depend on the number of passengers in the car. For every additional passenger, the gas cost will decrease by $25. \nRule 2: The cost of airfare will depend on the time of the year you are traveling. During peak season (June-August), the airfare will increase by $200. \nRule 3: The cost of riding a bus will depend on the distance traveled. For every 100 miles, the cost of the bus ticket will decrease by $5.\nTo make things more challenging, you need to calculate the total cost for each mode of transportation using the following formula:\nTotal Cost = (Base Cost + Extra Costs) * Number of Passengers\nCan you help figure out the best mode of transportation to take for a group of 6 people? And can you provide examples in Java, Python, and Bash?\n[Base Costs]\nDriving: Gas cost = $150, toll cost = $30, distance = 2,800 miles \nFlight: Airfare cost = $500, baggage fee = $50 per person, distance = 2,500 miles \nBus: Bus ticket cost = $120 per person, distance = 2,900 miles\n[Extra Costs]\nDriving: None \nFlight: Additional $200 during peak season \nBus: Decrease of $5 for every 100 miles traveled\nIn Java:\ndouble gasCost = 150;\ndouble tollCost = 30;\nint distance = 2800;\ndouble baseDrivingCost = gasCost + tollCost;\ndouble drivingExtraCost = 0;\nint numPassengers = 6;\ndouble airfareCost = 500;\ndouble baggageFee = 50;\ndouble baseFlightCost = airfareCost + (baggageFee * numPassengers);\ndouble flightExtraCost = 0;\nif (isPeakSeason()) {\n    flightExtraCost += 200;\n}\ndouble busTicketCost = 120;\nint busDistance = 2900;\ndouble baseBusCost = busTicketCost * numPassengers;\ndouble busExtraCost = (distance / 100) * 5;\ndouble drivingTotalCost = (baseDrivingCost + drivingExtraCost) * numPassengers;\ndouble flightTotalCost = (baseFlightCost + flightExtraCost) * numPassengers;\ndouble busTotalCost = (baseBusCost + busExtraCost) * numPassengers;\nSystem.out.println(\"Driving Total Cost: $\" + drivingTotalCost);\nSystem.out.println(\"Flight Total Cost: $\" + flightTotalCost);\nSystem.out.println(\"Bus Total Cost: $\" + busTotalCost);\nIn Python:\ngasCost = 150\ntollCost = 30\ndistance = 2800\nbaseDrivingCost = gasCost + tollCost\ndrivingExtraCost = 0\nnumPassengers = 6\nairfareCost = 500\nbaggageFee = 50\nbaseFlightCost = airfareCost + (baggageFee * numPassengers)\nflightExtraCost = 0\nif isPeakSeason():\n    flightExtraCost += 200\nbusTicketCost = 120\nbusDistance = 2900\nbaseBusCost = busTicketCost * numPassengers\nbusExtraCost = (distance / 100) * 5\ndrivingTotalCost = (baseDrivingCost + drivingExtraCost) * numPassengers\nflightTotalCost = (baseFlightCost + flightExtraCost) * numPassengers\nbusTotalCost = (baseBusCost + busExtraCost) * numPassengers\nprint(\"Driving Total Cost: $\" + str(drivingTotalCost))\nprint(\"Flight Total Cost: $\" + str(flightTotalCost))\nprint(\"Bus Total Cost: $\" + str(busTotalCost))\nIn Bash:\ngasCost=150\ntollCost=30\ndistance=2800\nbaseDrivingCost=$((gasCost + tollCost))\ndrivingExtraCost=0\nnumPassengers=6\nairfareCost=500\nbaggageFee=50\nbaseFlightCost=$((airfareCost + (baggageFee * numPassengers)))\nflightExtraCost=0\nif [ $(isPeakSeason) = true ]; then\n    flightExtraCost=$((flightExtraCost + 200))\nfi\nbusTicketCost=120\nbusDistance=2900\nbaseBusCost=$((busTicketCost * numPassengers))\nbusExtraCost=$((distance / 100 * 5))\ndrivingTotalCost=$((baseDrivingCost + drivingExtraCost * numPassengers))\nflightTotalCost=$((baseFlightCost + flightExtraCost * numPassengers))\nbusTotalCost=$((baseBusCost + busExtraCost * numPassengers))\necho \"Driving Total Cost: $\"$drivingTotalCost\necho \"Flight Total Cost: $\"$flightTotalCost\necho \"Bus Total Cost: $\"$busTotalCost"
