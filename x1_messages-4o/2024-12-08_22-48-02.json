The waste reduction rate can be calculated using the formula:\nWaste Reduction Rate = (Initial Waste - Final Waste) / Initial Waste * 100%\nwhere Initial Waste is the amount of waste produced before implementing the strategies and Final Waste is the amount of waste produced after implementing the strategies. Can you provide sample Swift code to calculate the waste reduction rate for a company using the data provided in the case study section of the report?"

        "content": "Certainly! Below is a sample Swift code snippet that calculates the waste reduction rate for a company using the provided formula. You'll need to replace `initialWaste` and `finalWaste` with the actual values from your case study section of the report.\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\n// Function to calculate waste reduction rate\nfunc calculateWasteReductionRate(initialWaste: Double, finalWaste: Double) -> Double {\n    guard initialWaste > 0 else {\n        print(\"Initial waste must be greater than zero.\")\n        return 0.0\n    }\n    \n    let wasteReductionRate = ((initialWaste - finalWaste) / initialWaste) * 100\n    return wasteReductionRate\n}\n\n// Sample data from the case study section\nlet initialWaste: Double = 1000.0 // replace with actual initial waste value\nlet finalWaste: Double = 600.0    // replace with actual final waste value\n\n// Calculate the waste reduction rate\nlet wasteReductionRate = calculateWasteReductionRate(initialWaste: initialWaste, finalWaste: finalWaste)\n\n// Print the result\nprint(\"The waste reduction rate is \\(wasteReductionRate)%\")\n```\n\nIn this code, the `calculateWasteReductionRate` function takes the `initialWaste` and `finalWaste` as inputs and returns the waste reduction rate as a percentage. Ensure that the `initialWaste` value is greater than zero to avoid division by zero errors. Replace the sample values with the actual data from your case study to get the correct calculation."
