I have downloaded Enthought Canopy EPD Free (now Canopy Express) from https://www.enthought.com/products/epd/free/ and I am trying to install SciKit Learn which is not part of the basic EPD Free install. This is available for download at http://sourceforge.net/projects/scikit-learn/files/. However, during installation, it does not find Python in the Windows registry. How can I adjust the registry to recognize the Enthought version of Python?"

        "content": "To add Python to the Windows registry, especially when you're using a specific distribution like Enthought Canopy, you'll need to manually edit the registry to point to your Python installation. Here are the steps to do that:\n\n1. **Find Your Python Installation Path**: \n   - Locate where Enthought Canopy has installed Python on your system. This might be something like `C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\AppData\\Local\\Enthought\\Canopy\\App\\Python`.\n\n2. **Open Registry Editor**:\n   - Press `Win + R`, type `regedit`, and press `Enter`.\n\n3. **Navigate to the PythonCore Key**:\n   - Go to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Python\\`.\n\n4. **Create a New Key for Your Python Version**:\n   - Under `Python`, if there isn\u2019t already a `PythonCore` key, create it.\n   - Inside `PythonCore`, create a new key for your Python version (e.g., `2.7` or `3.9`).\n\n5. **Add InstallPath**:\n   - Inside the version key (e.g., `3.9`), create a new key named `InstallPath`.\n   - Set the default value of `InstallPath` to the directory of your Python installation.\n\n6. **Include Python Directory in PATH** (optional but recommended):\n   - Right-click on `This PC` or `My Computer` and select `Properties`.\n   - Go to `Advanced system settings`.\n   - Click on `Environment Variables`.\n   - Under `System variables`, find the `Path` variable and click `Edit`.\n   - Add a new entry with the path to your Python directory (e.g., `C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\AppData\\Local\\Enthought\\Canopy\\App\\Python`).\n\n7. **Test the Installation**:\n   - Open a new command prompt and type `python` to ensure it starts the Enthought Canopy Python interpreter.\n\n8. **Install SciKit Learn**:\n   - Once Python is recognized, you can use `pip` to install SciKit Learn by running `pip install scikit-learn` in the command prompt.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to adjust the registry to recognize your Enthought version of Python, allowing you to proceed with installing SciKit Learn or any other Python packages. Always be cautious when editing the registry, as incorrect changes can affect your system's stability."
