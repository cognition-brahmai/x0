However, when I check the Python version at the start of my script, the code fails to run because the interpreter crashes within the module. Instead of informing the user to use a newer version of Python, it throws a system error. How can I address this?"

        "content": "To ensure that your Python script requires a minimum version of Python, you can add a version check at the beginning of your script. This check should be done before any other code that might not be compatible with earlier Python versions. By doing this, you can provide a user-friendly message and exit the script gracefully if the Python version is not sufficient.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Define the minimum required Python version\nmin_version = (2, 6)\n\n# Check the current Python version\nif sys.version_info < min_version:\n    sys.stderr.write(\n        \"This script requires Python {}.{} or higher!\\n\".format(*min_version)\n    )\n    sys.stderr.write(\n        \"You are currently using Python {}.{}.\\n\".format(\n            sys.version_info.major, sys.version_info.minor\n        )\n    )\n    sys.exit(1)\n\n# Your code here\n# The rest of your script can go here\n# For example:\nprint(\"Your Python version is sufficient to run this script.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Import `sys`:** This module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter and to functions that interact with the interpreter.\n\n2. **Define `min_version`:** This tuple specifies the minimum required Python version. In your case, it is (2, 6).\n\n3. **Check the current Python version:** The `sys.version_info` attribute provides the version information of the running Python interpreter as a tuple. You can compare this to your minimum version requirement.\n\n4. **Provide feedback and exit:** If the current Python version is less than the required version, output an error message to `sys.stderr` and exit the program using `sys.exit(1)`.\n\nThis approach ensures that the script will only proceed if the version requirement is met, and it provides a clear message to the user if the version is insufficient."
