As part of this, I created a function to remove C-style comments (both /* COMMENT */ and //COMMENT) from a string. However, when I test this function, it seems to do nothing. Can anyone suggest what I might be doing wrong? Here is my function:\n\n```python\ndef removeComments(string):\n    re.sub(re.compile(\"/\\*.*?\\*/\",re.DOTALL ) ,\"\",string) # remove all occurance streamed comments (/*COMMENT */) from string\n    re.sub(re.compile(\"//.*?\\n\" ) ,\"\",string) # remove all occurance singleline comments (//COMMENT\\n ) from string\n```\nAnd here is how I'm using it:\n```python\nstr=\"/* spam * spam */ eggs\"\nremoveComments(str)\nprint str\n```"

        "content": "The issue with your function is that the `re.sub` function returns a new string with the replacements, but it does not modify the original string in place. You need to assign the result of `re.sub` back to your string variable. Here's how you can modify your function to work correctly:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef removeComments(string):\n    # Remove all occurrences of block comments (/* COMMENT */)\n    string = re.sub(re.compile(\"/\\*.*?\\*/\", re.DOTALL), \"\", string)\n    # Remove all occurrences of line comments (// COMMENT)\n    string = re.sub(re.compile(\"//.*?\\n\"), \"\", string)\n    return string\n\n# Usage\nstr = \"/* spam * spam */ eggs // this is a line comment\\n more code\"\nstr = removeComments(str)\nprint(str)\n```\n\nThis way, the `removeComments` function returns the modified string without the comments, and you need to assign this result back to your original string variable. The `print` statement will then show the string with the comments removed."
