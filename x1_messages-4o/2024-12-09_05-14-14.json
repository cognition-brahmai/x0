        "content": "To enforce Foreign Key constraints in SQLite using SQLAlchemy, you need to ensure that the foreign key support is enabled for each database connection. In SQLite, foreign key constraints are not enabled by default, so you need to explicitly turn them on.\n\nHere's how you can do this using SQLAlchemy:\n\n1. **Enable Foreign Key Support**: You can enable foreign key support by executing the `PRAGMA foreign_keys` command every time a new database connection is created. You can achieve this by using SQLAlchemy's event system.\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine, event\n\n# Create the engine\nengine = create_engine('sqlite:///your_database.db')\n\n# Listen for the 'connect' event and enable foreign key constraints\n@event.listens_for(engine, \"connect\")\ndef set_sqlite_pragma(dbapi_connection, connection_record):\n    cursor = dbapi_connection.cursor()\n    cursor.execute(\"PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON\")\n    cursor.close()\n```\n\n2. **Check SQLite Version in Python**: You can determine the SQLite version that Python is using by inspecting the `sqlite3` module. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\n\n# Get the SQLite version\nsqlite_version = sqlite3.sqlite_version\nprint(\"SQLite version:\", sqlite_version)\n```\n\n3. **Ensure Python Uses the Latest SQLite Version**: If you find that Python is not using the latest version of SQLite that you have installed, it may be because Python is bundled with its own version of SQLite. To use a different version, you would need to:\n\n   - **Rebuild Python**: This involves building Python from source and linking it to the desired SQLite version. This can be complex and is generally not recommended unless necessary.\n   \n   - **Use a Virtual Environment**: Sometimes, using a virtual environment can help manage dependencies better and might allow you to specify a different SQLite version, but usually, it still depends on the Python build.\n\n   - **Upgrade Python**: If you are using an outdated version of Python, consider upgrading to a more recent one, as it might come with a newer SQLite version.\n\n4. **Verify Your Setup**: After setting up, you should verify that foreign keys are actually being enforced. You can test this by creating tables with foreign keys and attempting to insert invalid data to see if an error occurs.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to enforce foreign key constraints and verify the SQLite version in your Python environment."
