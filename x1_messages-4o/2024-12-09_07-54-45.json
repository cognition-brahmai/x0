        "content": "The behavior you're experiencing is likely due to the lack of readline support in the Python interactive shell on OS X Snow Leopard. The readline library is responsible for handling input features like command history and line editing, which are typically invoked with the arrow keys.\n\nHere's how you can fix this issue:\n\n1. **Install GNU Readline:**\n   You'll need to install the GNU Readline library and then recompile Python to use it. You can do this using a package manager like Homebrew.\n\n   First, install Homebrew if you haven't already:\n\n   ```bash\n   /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n   ```\n\n   Then, install readline:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew install readline\n   ```\n\n2. **Recompile Python with Readline Support:**\n   You'll need to recompile Python so that it links against the newly installed readline library. You can do this by installing Python via Homebrew:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew install python\n   ```\n\n   This should automatically link Python against the readline library.\n\n3. **Use an Alternative Interactive Shell:**\n   If recompiling Python is not an option, you can use an alternative interactive shell like IPython, which provides better support for command history and line editing.\n\n   To install IPython, you can use pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install ipython\n   ```\n\n   Then, start IPython by simply typing `ipython` in your terminal.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to use the arrow keys in the Python interactive mode without any issues."
