Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef round_up_to_nearest_ten(number):\n    return math.ceil(number / 10) * 10\n\n# Example usage\nnumber = 46\nrounded_number = round_up_to_nearest_ten(number)\nprint(rounded_number)  # Output: 50\n```\n\nIn this code, you divide the number by 10, use `math.ceil` to round it up to the nearest integer, and then multiply by 10 to get the result rounded up to the nearest ten."
