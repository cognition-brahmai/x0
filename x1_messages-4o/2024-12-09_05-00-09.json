The style of the original window gets messed up after attaching and detaching. I've already tried using flags/setFlags and getWindowLong/setWindowLong but haven't had any luck.\n2. If I attach and detach the calculator to the main window and then close the main window, the PyQt process does not close and clean properly. It requires manual termination of the process, indicating incorrect parenting/deparenting.\n\nCan you help me fix these issues?"

        "content": "To address the issues you're experiencing, we need to make sure we're correctly managing the window styles and parent-child relationships between the PyQt application and the external application window (Calculator in this case). Let's tackle each issue separately:\n\n### Issue 1: Messed Up Window Style After Attach/Detach\n\nWhen modifying the style of an external window, it's crucial to restore the original style once you're done. You can achieve this by saving the original style before modifying it and then restoring it during detachment. However, you've commented out the code related to window styles, so let's reinstate and improve it:\n\n```python\ndef attach(self):\n    # Save the current window style\n    self._style = win32gui.GetWindowLong(self.hwnd, win32con.GWL_STYLE)\n    \n    # Remove the title bar and frame\n    win32gui.SetWindowLong(self.hwnd, win32con.GWL_STYLE, self._style & ~win32con.WS_CAPTION & ~win32con.WS_THICKFRAME)\n    win32gui.SetParent(self.hwnd, self.dock.winId())\n    \n    self._window = QWindow.fromWinId(self.hwnd)\n    self._widget = self.createWindowContainer(self._window)\n    self.dock.setWidget(self._widget)\n\ndef detach(self):\n    if self._window:\n        # Restore the original window style\n        win32gui.SetWindowLong(self.hwnd, win32con.GWL_STYLE, self._style)\n        win32gui.SetParent(self.hwnd, 0)\n        \n        self._window.setParent(None)\n        self._window.show()\n        self.dock.setWidget(None)\n        self._widget = None\n        self._window = None\n```\n\n### Issue 2: PyQt Process Not Closing Properly\n\nThis issue is likely due to the external process remaining attached to the main window. To ensure that the external application is properly detached and the PyQt application closes cleanly, make sure to handle the cleanup in the `closeEvent` of the main window:\n\n```python\ndef closeEvent(self, event):\n    try:\n        if self._window:\n            self.detach()\n    except Exception as e:\n        import traceback\n        traceback.print_exc()\n    super().closeEvent(event)\n```\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Error Handling**: It's always a good idea to have proper error handling, especially when dealing with external processes and window handles. Ensure that exceptions are caught and logged to help diagnose issues.\n  \n- **Process Management**: Make sure that the external process (Calculator) is terminated when the main window closes. You might want to hold a reference to the process and call `p.terminate()` during cleanup.\n\nHere's how you can modify the initialization to store the process reference:\n\n```python\ndef __init__(self, path_exe):\n    super().__init__()\n\n    # ... existing code ...\n\n    self.process = subprocess.Popen(path_exe)\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n    self.hwnd = win32gui.FindWindowEx(0, 0, \"CalcFrame\", None)\n    if self.hwnd == 0:\n        raise Exception(\"Process not found\")\n\ndef closeEvent(self, event):\n    try:\n        if self._window:\n            self.detach()\n        if self.process:\n            self.process.terminate()\n    except Exception as e:\n        import traceback\n        traceback.print_exc()\n    super().closeEvent(event)\n```\n\nBy implementing these changes, you should be able to resolve the issues with window styling and ensure the PyQt application closes properly."
