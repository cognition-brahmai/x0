        "content": "Creating a JSON document that captures the grievances of citizens towards the government, segmented by age group, along with their demands, satisfaction levels, and percentages can be approached by first defining a clear structure for your JSON object. Below is a sample Ruby code that generates such a JSON document:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'json'\n\n# Sample data\ndata = {\n  \"age_groups\" => [\n    {\n      \"age_range\" => \"18-25\",\n      \"percentage_of_population\" => 15,\n      \"satisfaction_level\" => \"Low\",\n      \"grievances\" => [\n        {\n          \"issue\" => \"Unemployment\",\n          \"demand\" => \"Increase job opportunities\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"issue\" => \"Education\",\n          \"demand\" => \"Reduce tuition fees\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"age_range\" => \"26-35\",\n      \"percentage_of_population\" => 20,\n      \"satisfaction_level\" => \"Moderate\",\n      \"grievances\" => [\n        {\n          \"issue\" => \"Housing\",\n          \"demand\" => \"Affordable housing schemes\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"issue\" => \"Healthcare\",\n          \"demand\" => \"Better healthcare services\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"age_range\" => \"36-45\",\n      \"percentage_of_population\" => 25,\n      \"satisfaction_level\" => \"High\",\n      \"grievances\" => [\n        {\n          \"issue\" => \"Infrastructure\",\n          \"demand\" => \"Improve rural infrastructure\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n# Convert the data to JSON format\njson_document = JSON.pretty_generate(data)\n\n# Output the JSON document\nputs json_document\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **age_groups**: This is an array of hashes, where each hash represents a specific age group.\n- **age_range**: Defines the age range for the group.\n- **percentage_of_population**: Indicates the percentage of the total population that falls within this age group.\n- **satisfaction_level**: Represents the general satisfaction level of the age group with current government policies. This can be values like \"Low\", \"Moderate\", or \"High\".\n- **grievances**: An array of hashes, where each hash contains:\n  - **issue**: The specific grievance or issue that citizens in the age group have.\n  - **demand**: The corresponding demand or solution that citizens are seeking for the issue.\n\nThis code snippet will generate a JSON document with structured data. You can modify the sample data as needed to fit your specific context or use a database to populate it dynamically."
