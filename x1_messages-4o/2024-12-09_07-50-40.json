Here are the three different styles I've used:\n\n```python\n# before\nmy_var = somethinglikethis.where(we=do_things).where(we=domore).where(we=everdomore)\n\n# this way\nmy_var = somethinglikethis.where(we=do_things) \\\n                          .where(we=domore) \\\n                          .where(we=everdomore)\n\n# or this way\nmy_var = somethinglikethis.where(we=do_things). \\\n                           where(we=domore). \\\n                           where(we=everdomore)\n```"

        "content": "In Python, when chaining methods and dealing with line breaks, style and readability are the primary considerations. According to the PEP 8 style guide, which is the style guide for Python code, the preference is generally for the following style:\n\n```python\nmy_var = (somethinglikethis\n          .where(we=do_things)\n          .where(we=domore)\n          .where(we=everdomore))\n```\n\nThis style places the period at the beginning of the continuation line, which makes it clear that the line is a continuation of the previous one and that the method chaining is ongoing. It also avoids the use of a backslash (`\\`) for line continuation, which can sometimes lead to readability issues and errors if not used carefully.\n\nThe parentheses around the entire expression ensure that the line breaks are handled correctly by Python, and they also make it visually clear that the lines are part of a single logical statement. This style tends to be more visually appealing and is commonly seen in the Python community.\n\nHowever, the ultimate choice can depend on team conventions, personal preference, and the specific context of your code. The key goal should be to maintain readability and consistency throughout your codebase."
