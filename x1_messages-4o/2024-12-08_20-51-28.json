        "content": "To solve the expression \\(\\sin^{-1}(0.5) + \\cos^{-1}(0.3) - \\tan^{-1}(1.5)\\), we need to calculate each inverse trigonometric function separately.\n\n1. \\(\\sin^{-1}(0.5)\\): This is the angle whose sine is 0.5. The angle is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\) or approximately 0.5236 radians.\n\n2. \\(\\cos^{-1}(0.3)\\): This is the angle whose cosine is 0.3. This can be found using a calculator, which gives approximately 1.2661 radians.\n\n3. \\(\\tan^{-1}(1.5)\\): This is the angle whose tangent is 1.5. Using a calculator, this is approximately 0.9828 radians.\n\nNow, compute the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\sin^{-1}(0.5) + \\cos^{-1}(0.3) - \\tan^{-1}(1.5) \\approx 0.5236 + 1.2661 - 0.9828 \\approx 0.8069\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is approximately 0.8069 radians."
