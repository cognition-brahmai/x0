It seems it is not changing the current directory, which is causing many of my commands to fail. I wrote a test and the results were not as expected. Using the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import with_statement\nfrom fabric.api import local, run, cd\n\ndef xxx():\n    with cd(\"src\"):\n        local(\"pwd\")\n```\nWhen I run 'fab xxx', the result is '/home/pioneer/workspace/myproject' instead of '/home/pioneer/workspace/myproject/src'. Why is the 'cd' context manager not changing the directory as expected?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is related to the behavior of Fabric's `local` and `cd` commands. In Fabric, the `cd` context manager is designed to change the working directory on the remote host when using the `run` command, not when using the `local` command. This is why you are not seeing the expected behavior when using `local` with `cd`.\n\nWhen you use `local`, it executes the command in the local shell, and the `cd` context manager does not affect the local command execution environment. The directory change using `cd` only applies to remote operations with `run`.\n\nTo achieve the desired behavior with local commands, you can use shell commands directly within the `local` function. Here's how you can modify your code to work as expected:\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import with_statement\nfrom fabric.api import local\n\ndef xxx():\n    local(\"cd src && pwd\")\n```\n\nIn this version, `cd src && pwd` is a shell command that changes the directory to `src` and then executes `pwd`, effectively giving you the desired output.\n\nIf you need to perform multiple operations in the same directory, you can also use a multi-line shell script:\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import with_statement\nfrom fabric.api import local\n\ndef xxx():\n    local(\"\"\"\n        cd src\n        pwd\n        # Add more commands here if needed\n    \"\"\")\n```\n\nThis way, all commands within the triple-quoted string will be executed in the context of the `src` directory."
