The output should look like this:\n\n```python\nindex col1   col2   col3   col4   \n0     a      c      2      4          \n1     a      d      1      2      \n2     b      d      1      2      \n3     b      e      2      4      \n```\n\nI have tried the following code:\n\n```python\ndf_new = df.groupby(['col1', 'col2'])['col3', 'col4'].sum()\n```\n\nBut this only returns the aggregated results of col4. I am having trouble finding examples that aggregate more than one column. How can I aggregate both col3 and col4 after grouping by col1 and col2?"

        "content": "It seems like the issue arises from using an outdated syntax for selecting multiple columns in the `groupby` method. In recent versions of Pandas, you'll get a `FutureWarning` if you try to select multiple columns in the way you've written. You should use a list of column names to specify the columns you want to aggregate.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndf_new = df.groupby(['col1', 'col2'])[['col3', 'col4']].sum().reset_index()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `[['col3', 'col4']]` is used to select multiple columns for aggregation.\n- `.sum()` performs the aggregation by summing the values of `col3` and `col4`.\n- `.reset_index()` is used to reset the index of the resulting DataFrame, which is especially useful if you want `col1` and `col2` to be columns rather than part of the index in the output.\n\nThis should give you the desired output:\n\n```python\n  col1 col2  col3  col4\n0    a    c     2     4\n1    a    d     1     2\n2    b    d     1     2\n3    b    e     2     4\n```\n\nMake sure you are using a recent version of Pandas for the best compatibility with this syntax."
