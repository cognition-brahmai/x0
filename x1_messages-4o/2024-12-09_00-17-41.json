        "content": "Your current approach is quite straightforward and works well for stripping non-numeric characters except for the dot (\".\"). However, if you're looking for a potentially more efficient or concise method, you can use regular expressions with the `re` module. Here's how you can achieve the same result using `re.sub`:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nval = \"your_input_string_here\"\nval = re.sub(r'[^0-9.]', '', val)\n```\n\nThis code uses a regular expression to replace any character that is not a digit (`0-9`) or a dot (`.`) with an empty string. It's a clean and efficient method for this kind of operation.\n\nIf performance is critical and you are processing a large number of strings, benchmarking both methods would be a good idea to see which one performs better in your specific case. However, for most typical use cases, either approach should work efficiently."
