I have a list, N = [1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5], and I'm aiming to create a new list, L = [[1],[2,2],[3,3,3],[4,4,4,4],[5,5,5,5,5]]. In my current approach, I'm trying to use a 'while' loop. The function I've written for this uses comparison to check if values in the initial list are the same, and if they are, it groups them together in the new list. Here's what I've done so far:\n\n```python\nglobal n\n\nn = [1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5] #Sorted list\nl = [] #Empty list to append values to\n\ndef compare(val):\n   \"\"\" This function receives index values\n   from the n list (n[0] etc) \"\"\"\n   \n   global valin\n   valin = val\n\n   global count\n   count = 0\n\n   for i in xrange(len(n)):\n        if valin == n[count]: # If the input value i.e. n[x] == n[iteration]\n            temp = valin, n[count]\n            l.append(temp) #append the values to a new list\n            count +=1\n        else:\n          count +=1\n    \n\nfor x in xrange (len(n)):\n    compare(n[x]) #pass the n[x] to compare function\n```"

        "content": "Your approach seems to be on the right track, but it can be simplified and made more efficient. You don't need to use global variables or a separate function for comparison. Here's a cleaner and more efficient way to group the same values into sublists using a 'while' loop:\n\n```python\nN = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]\nL = []  # List to store the grouped sublists\n\ni = 0\nwhile i < len(N):\n    current_value = N[i]  # Get the current value\n    sublist = []  # Create a new sublist to store the current group\n\n    # Loop to group the same values together\n    while i < len(N) and N[i] == current_value:\n        sublist.append(N[i])\n        i += 1\n\n    # Append the grouped sublist to the main list L\n    L.append(sublist)\n\nprint(L)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what this code does:\n\n1. It initializes an index `i` to 0 to track the current position in the list `N`.\n2. It uses a `while` loop to iterate over the list `N`.\n3. For each unique value in `N`, it creates a `sublist` and appends all consecutive occurrences of that value to `sublist`.\n4. Once it encounters a different value, it appends the `sublist` to the main list `L`.\n5. The loop continues until all elements in `N` are processed.\n\nThis approach is efficient and concise, and it will give you the desired output `L = [[1], [2, 2], [3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4, 4], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]]`."
