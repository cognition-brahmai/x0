However, this function takes a lot of time to execute, which results in a connection timeout and I get this error: `Socket error: [Errno 32] Broken pipe`. Is there a method in Flask to execute a function after returning the request?"

        "content": "Yes, you can execute a function after sending a response to the client in Flask by performing the task in a separate thread or using a task queue like Celery. Here's an overview of both approaches:\n\n### 1. Using a Background Thread\n\nYou can use Python's `threading` module to execute your function in a separate thread. Here's a simple example:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, jsonify\nimport threading\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\ndef long_running_function():\n    # Your long-running task here\n    import time\n    time.sleep(10)\n    print(\"Task complete!\")\n\n@app.route('/start-task', methods=['GET'])\ndef start_task():\n    # Start the long-running function in a separate thread\n    thread = threading.Thread(target=long_running_function)\n    thread.start()\n    \n    # Send response to client\n    return jsonify({\"status\": \"Task started\"}), 202\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n### 2. Using Celery\n\nCelery is a distributed task queue that can handle asynchronous execution of tasks. Here's a basic setup:\n\n1. **Install Celery:**\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install celery\n   ```\n\n2. **Set up Celery with Flask:**\n\n   First, create a Celery instance in your Flask app:\n\n   ```python\n   from flask import Flask, jsonify\n   from celery import Celery\n\n   app = Flask(__name__)\n   app.config['CELERY_BROKER_URL'] = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'  # You can use other brokers too\n   app.config['CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND'] = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'\n\n   def make_celery(app):\n       celery = Celery(app.import_name, broker=app.config['CELERY_BROKER_URL'])\n       celery.conf.update(app.config)\n       TaskBase = celery.Task\n\n       class ContextTask(TaskBase):\n           abstract = True\n           def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n               with app.app_context():\n                   return TaskBase.__call__(self, *args, **kwargs)\n       \n       celery.Task = ContextTask\n       return celery\n\n   celery = make_celery(app)\n\n   @celery.task\n   def long_running_task():\n       import time\n       time.sleep(10)\n       print(\"Task complete!\")\n\n   @app.route('/start-task', methods=['GET'])\n   def start_task():\n       long_running_task.delay()\n       return jsonify({\"status\": \"Task started\"}), 202\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       app.run(debug=True)\n   ```\n\n3. **Run Celery Worker:**\n\n   In another terminal, start the Celery worker:\n\n   ```bash\n   celery -A your_flask_app_name.celery worker --loglevel=info\n   ```\n\nReplace `your_flask_app_name` with the name of your Flask app file (without the `.py` extension).\n\nUsing Celery is a more robust solution, especially if you expect the task to be long-running or if you need to scale your application in the future."
