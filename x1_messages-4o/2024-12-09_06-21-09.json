        "content": "The error you're encountering is a common issue when working with AJAX requests across different domains, known as a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issue. This happens because the browser's same-origin policy restricts how a script loaded from one origin can interact with resources from another origin.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to configure your Python Bottle server to include the appropriate CORS headers in its responses. Here's how you can do that:\n\n1. **Using a Decorator in Bottle:**\n   You can create a decorator function to add CORS headers to your route responses.\n\n   ```python\n   from bottle import response, route, run\n\n   def enable_cors(fn):\n       def _enable_cors(*args, **kwargs):\n           # Set CORS headers\n           response.headers['Access-Control-Allow-Origin'] = '*'\n           response.headers['Access-Control-Allow-Methods'] = 'GET, POST, PUT, OPTIONS'\n           response.headers['Access-Control-Allow-Headers'] = 'Origin, Accept, Content-Type, X-Requested-With, X-CSRF-Token'\n           \n           if bottle.request.method != 'OPTIONS':\n               # Actual request; proceed as normal\n               return fn(*args, **kwargs)\n\n       return _enable_cors\n\n   @route('/routeREST/select', method=['GET', 'OPTIONS'])\n   @enable_cors\n   def select():\n       # Your route logic here\n       return \"Your response data\"\n\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       run(host='localhost', port=8666)\n   ```\n\n2. **Handling Preflight OPTIONS Request:**\n   Ensure the server can handle OPTIONS requests, which are preflight requests sent by browsers to check if the actual request is safe to send.\n\n3. **Testing:**\n   Restart your Bottle server and test your AJAX requests to see if the CORS issue is resolved.\n\n4. **Security Note:**\n   Using `'*'` as the value for `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is generally not recommended for production, as it allows any website to access your resources. Instead, specify the exact origin(s) that should be allowed.\n\nBy implementing these changes, your Bottle server should be able to handle CORS requests from your JavaScript application running on a different port."
