        "content": "You can sort a list of strings based on their character length in Python using the `sorted()` function or the `sort()` method with a custom key. Here's how you can do it with both methods:\n\n### Using `sorted()`\n\nThe `sorted()` function returns a new list that is sorted:\n\n```python\n# List of strings\nstrings = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"date\"]\n\n# Sort the list by the length of each string\nsorted_strings = sorted(strings, key=len)\n\nprint(sorted_strings)\n```\n\n### Using `sort()`\n\nThe `sort()` method sorts the list in place and does not return a new list:\n\n```python\n# List of strings\nstrings = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"date\"]\n\n# Sort the list by the length of each string in place\nstrings.sort(key=len)\n\nprint(strings)\n```\n\nBoth of these methods will sort the list of strings based on their character length, resulting in:\n\n```\n['date', 'apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n```\n\nIn both cases, the `key` parameter is set to `len`, which is a built-in function that returns the length of the string."
