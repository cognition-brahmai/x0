Despite the two files being in the same folder, I'm unable to import the function. Can you help me solve this problem?"

        "content": "Certainly! The issue you're encountering is related to Python's module import system. Even though `app.py` and `config.py` are in the same folder, Python might not recognize them as modules that can be imported directly, depending on how the script is being executed.\n\nHere are a few steps to resolve this:\n\n1. **Use Relative Imports**: Since both files are in the same directory, you can use a relative import. Replace your import statement in `app.py` with:\n\n   ```python\n   from . import config as Config\n   ```\n\n   This tells Python to look at the local package context, which is defined by the folder and its `__init__.py` file.\n\n2. **Check the Entry Point**: Ensure you are running your application from the root directory (`DoubleDibz`) using the `run.py` file. This ensures that the `app` directory is treated as a package.\n\n3. **Update the `PYTHONPATH`**: If you still face issues, you can manually set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to include the `DoubleDibz` directory. This can be done in the terminal before running your script:\n\n   On Unix-based systems (Linux/Mac):\n\n   ```bash\n   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/DoubleDibz\n   ```\n\n   On Windows:\n\n   ```cmd\n   set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:\\path\\to\\DoubleDibz\n   ```\n\n4. **Run as a Module**: Another approach is to run the application as a module by navigating to the root directory and using the `-m` flag:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m app.app\n   ```\n\n5. **Double-check `__init__.py` files**: Ensure that all directories you want to be treated as packages have `__init__.py` files, even if they're empty.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the import issue. If you continue to experience problems, double-check your directory paths and ensure there are no naming conflicts with other Python modules."
