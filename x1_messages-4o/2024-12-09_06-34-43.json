How can I correctly format the string to include the '%' sign in the output?"

To include a literal `%` sign in your output, you need to escape it by using `%%`.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to correctly include the `%` sign:\n\n```python\noFile.write(\"Percentage: %s%%\\n\" % percent)\n```\n\nIn this corrected line, `%%` is used to include a literal `%` character in the output. This way, the format specifier `%s` will correctly be replaced by the value of `percent`, and the `%%` will be replaced by a single `%` in the final output."
