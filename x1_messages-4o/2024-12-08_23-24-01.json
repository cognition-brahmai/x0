One compartment is filled with pure water and the other compartment is filled with pure alcohol. The mixture is created by combining equal amounts of water and alcohol from each compartment. If the removal and replacement process only occurs in one of the compartments, what is the new ratio of water to alcohol in the entire container? Round your answer to the nearest tenth."

        "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\nInitially, we have two compartments, each with a capacity of 50 liters:\n\n- Compartment A: 50 liters of pure water\n- Compartment B: 50 liters of pure alcohol\n\nNow, assume we remove \\( x \\) liters from one compartment and replace it with the same amount from the other compartment. Because the problem specifies that the removal and replacement process only occurs in one of the compartments, let's say we perform this operation on Compartment A.\n\n1. **Remove \\( x \\) liters of water from Compartment A and replace it with \\( x \\) liters of alcohol from Compartment B:**\n\n   - Compartment A now has \\( (50 - x) \\) liters of water and \\( x \\) liters of alcohol.\n   - Compartment B still has 50 liters, but \\( x \\) liters of alcohol have been removed, so it now has \\( (50 - x) \\) liters of alcohol and \\( x \\) liters of water added.\n\n2. **Mixture in the entire container:**\n\n   - Total water in the container: \\( (50 - x) + x = 50 \\) liters\n   - Total alcohol in the container: \\( x + (50 - x) = 50 \\) liters\n\nAfter this operation, the mixture in the entire container is 50 liters of water and 50 liters of alcohol. The ratio of water to alcohol remains 1:1, or simply 1.0 when rounded to the nearest tenth.\n\nThus, the new ratio of water to alcohol in the entire container is 1.0."
