        "content": "The KeyError you're encountering is due to the fact that you're using curly braces `{}` within your string template, which are being interpreted by the `str.format()` method as placeholders for variables.\n\nIn your string template, you have:\n\n```python\ntemplate = \"\\\nfunction routes(app, model){\\\n  app.get('/preNew{className}', function(req, res){\\\n    res.render('{className}'.ejs, {});\\\n  });\\\n});\".format(className=className)\n```\n\nThe issue is with the `{className}` placeholders, which are correctly formatted for substitution, but the `{}` inside `res.render('{className}.ejs, {});` is being considered as a placeholder by the `format()` method, and since you haven't provided a key for it, it throws a `KeyError`.\n\nTo fix this, you need to escape the curly braces that are not meant for variable substitution. You can do this by doubling the curly braces `{{}}`. Here's your corrected code:\n\n```python\ntemplate = \"\\\nfunction routes(app, model){\\\n  app.get('/preNew{className}', function(req, res){\\\n    res.render('{className}.ejs', {{}});\\\n  });\\\n});\".format(className=className)\n```\n\nBy using `{{}}`, you're telling the `format()` method to treat them as literal curly braces rather than as a placeholder. This should resolve the `KeyError` you're encountering."
