My program takes a user input to select the measure of the coins (grams or pounds), and then it calculates the number of coins, their worth, and the number of rolls needed. However, I am encountering an error that says \"TypeError: list indices must be integers, not tuple\". The error points to the line where I define the list \"coin_args\". I have been trying to solve this for two days and I have read through the documentation for lists and tuples, but I haven't found a solution. Could you point me in the right direction to solve this error?\n\nHere is my code:\n\n```python\nmeasure = raw_input(\"How would you like to measure the coins? Enter 1 for grams 2 for pounds.  \")\n\ncoin_args = [\n[\"pennies\", '2.5', '50.0', '.01'] \n[\"nickles\", '5.0', '40.0', '.05']\n[\"dimes\", '2.268', '50.0', '.1']\n[\"quarters\", '5.67', '40.0', '.25']\n]\n\nif measure == 2:\n    for coin, coin_weight, rolls, worth in coin_args:\n        print \"Enter the weight of your %s\" % (coin)\n        weight = float(raw_input())\n        convert2grams = weight * 453.592\n\n        num_coin = convert2grams / (float(coin_weight))\n        num_roll = round(num_coin / (float(rolls)))\n        amount = round(num_coin * (float(worth)), 2)\n\n        print \"You have %d %s, worth $ %d, and will need %d rolls.\" % (num_coin, coin, amount, num_roll)\n\nelse:\n    for coin, coin_weight, rolls, worth in coin_args:\n        print \"Enter the weight of your %s\" % (coin)\n        weight = float(raw_input())\n\n        num_coin = weight / (float(coin_weight))\n        num_roll = round(num_coin / (float(rolls)))\n        amount = round(num_coin * (float(worth)), 2)\n\n        print \"You have %d %s, worth $ %d, and will need %d rolls.\" % (num_coin, coin, amount, num_roll)\n```\n\nAnd here is the stack trace:\n\n```python\nFile \".\\coin_estimator_by_weight.py\", line 5, in <module>\n  [\"nickles\", '5.0', '40.0', '.05']\nTypeError: list indices must be integers, not tuple\n```"

        "content": "The error you are encountering is due to a missing comma in your `coin_args` list. In Python, elements in a list need to be separated by commas. Without commas, Python interprets the elements as a single tuple, which leads to the \"TypeError: list indices must be integers, not tuple\" error.\n\nHere's the corrected version of your `coin_args` list:\n\n```python\ncoin_args = [\n    [\"pennies\", '2.5', '50.0', '.01'],\n    [\"nickles\", '5.0', '40.0', '.05'],\n    [\"dimes\", '2.268', '50.0', '.1'],\n    [\"quarters\", '5.67', '40.0', '.25']\n]\n```\n\nI've added commas at the end of each list element to separate them properly. This should resolve the error you're encountering.\n\nAdditionally, there are a few improvements and corrections I can suggest:\n\n1. Ensure you compare `measure` with `'2'` as `raw_input()` returns a string, not an integer. Here is the corrected condition:\n\n```python\nif measure == '2':\n```\n\n2. When printing the results, you might want to use `%f` for floating-point numbers instead of `%d`, which is for integers. This is especially important for `amount`, which is a floating-point number. Also, to ensure the number of coins and rolls are integers, you may want to convert them using `int()`.\n\n3. Consider using Python's built-in string formatting methods like `.format()` or f-strings for more readability, especially when working with Python 3.x in the future.\n\nYour corrected code with these improvements would look like this:\n\n```python\nmeasure = raw_input(\"How would you like to measure the coins? Enter 1 for grams 2 for pounds. \")\n\ncoin_args = [\n    [\"pennies\", '2.5', '50.0', '.01'],\n    [\"nickles\", '5.0', '40.0', '.05'],\n    [\"dimes\", '2.268', '50.0', '.1'],\n    [\"quarters\", '5.67', '40.0', '.25']\n]\n\nif measure == '2':\n    for coin, coin_weight, rolls, worth in coin_args:\n        print \"Enter the weight of your %s\" % (coin)\n        weight = float(raw_input())\n        convert2grams = weight * 453.592\n\n        num_coin = convert2grams / (float(coin_weight))\n        num_roll = int(round(num_coin / (float(rolls))))\n        amount = round(num_coin * (float(worth)), 2)\n\n        print \"You have %d %s, worth $%.2f, and will need %d rolls.\" % (int(num_coin), coin, amount, num_roll)\n\nelse:\n    for coin, coin_weight, rolls, worth in coin_args:\n        print \"Enter the weight of your %s\" % (coin)\n        weight = float(raw_input())\n\n        num_coin = weight / (float(coin_weight))\n        num_roll = int(round(num_coin / (float(rolls))))\n        amount = round(num_coin * (float(worth)), 2)\n\n        print \"You have %d %s, worth $%.2f, and will need %d rolls.\" % (int(num_coin), coin, amount, num_roll)\n```\n\nI hope this helps you to resolve the error and improve your code!"
