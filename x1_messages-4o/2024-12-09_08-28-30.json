Specifically, you can use `numpy.linalg.norm`, which is designed to compute the norm of an array. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef mag(x):\n    return np.linalg.norm(x)\n```\n\n`numpy.linalg.norm` calculates the Euclidean norm (L2 norm) of the vector by default, which is equivalent to the magnitude you're looking for. This function is optimized and should be faster than manually computing the sum of squares and taking the square root."
