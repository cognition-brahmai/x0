        "content": "Creating a Node.js application to fetch a response from a given URL via an HTTP request can be achieved using the built-in `http` or `https` modules, or by using a popular third-party library like `axios` or `node-fetch`. Here, I'll show you how to do it using both the built-in `https` module and the `axios` library.\n\n### Using the Built-in `https` Module\n\n1. **Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:**\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir node-http-example\n   cd node-http-example\n   ```\n\n2. **Initialize a new Node.js project:**\n\n   ```bash\n   npm init -y\n   ```\n\n3. **Create a file named `app.js`:**\n\n   ```javascript\n   // app.js\n   const https = require('https');\n\n   const url = 'https://api.example.com/data'; // Replace with your URL\n\n   https.get(url, (response) => {\n     let data = '';\n\n     // A chunk of data has been received.\n     response.on('data', (chunk) => {\n       data += chunk;\n     });\n\n     // The whole response has been received. Print out the result.\n     response.on('end', () => {\n       console.log(JSON.parse(data));\n     });\n\n   }).on('error', (err) => {\n     console.error('Error: ' + err.message);\n   });\n   ```\n\n4. **Run your application:**\n\n   ```bash\n   node app.js\n   ```\n\n### Using the `axios` Library\n\n1. **Install `axios`:**\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install axios\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a file named `app.js`:**\n\n   ```javascript\n   // app.js\n   const axios = require('axios');\n\n   const url = 'https://api.example.com/data'; // Replace with your URL\n\n   axios.get(url)\n     .then(response => {\n       console.log(response.data);\n     })\n     .catch(error => {\n       console.error('Error:', error.message);\n     });\n   ```\n\n3. **Run your application:**\n\n   ```bash\n   node app.js\n   ```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Using `https`:** You create a GET request to the specified URL. Data is received in chunks, and you accumulate it until the entire response is received. Finally, you parse and log the data.\n  \n- **Using `axios`:** This library simplifies the HTTP request process. It returns a promise, making it easy to handle asynchronous operations with `.then()` and `.catch()` for success and error handling, respectively.\n\nYou can choose either method based on your preference and the complexity of your application. `axios` is generally preferred for its simplicity and additional features like request cancellation and automatic JSON transformation."
