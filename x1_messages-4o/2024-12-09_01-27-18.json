Occasionally, clients receive 0-byte responses. In the app's log, it's clear that a value is being returned, Gunicorn recognizes a 200 status and 22 bytes HTTP body, but the Heroku router log shows 0 bytes being passed back to the client. Is this a Heroku bug?\n\nHere's a snippet of my app's log:\n\n```\nMar 14 13:13:31 d.0b1adf0a-0597-4f5c-8901-dfe7cda9bce0 app[web.1]\n[2013-03-14 13:13:31 UTC] 10.104.41.136 apisrv -\napi_get_credits_balance(): session_token=[MASKED]\n\nMar 14 13:13:31 d.0b1adf0a-0597-4f5c-8901-dfe7cda9bce0 app[web.1]\n[2013-03-14 13:13:31 UTC] 10.104.41.136 apisrv 1252148511\napi_get_credits_balance(): returning [{'credits_balance': 0}]\n\nMar 14 13:13:31 d.0b1adf0a-0597-4f5c-8901-dfe7cda9bce0 app[web.1]\n\"10.104.41.136 - - [14/Mar/2013:13:13:31] \"POST\n/get_credits_balance?session_token=MASKED HTTP/1.1\" 200 22 \"-\"\n\"Appcelerator Titanium/3.0.0.GA (iPhone/6.1.2; iPhone OS; en_US;)\"\n\nMar 14 13:13:30 d.0b1adf0a-0597-4f5c-8901-dfe7cda9bce0 heroku[router]\nat=info method=POST path=/get_credits_balance?session_token=MASKED\nhost=matchspot-apisrv.herokuapp.com fwd=\"66.87.116.128\" dyno=web.1\nqueue=0 wait=0ms connect=1ms service=19ms status=200 bytes=0\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing with the Heroku router log showing 0 bytes being passed back to the client, despite your application logging a successful response, is likely not a Heroku bug but rather a misconfiguration or subtle problem in the application or its deployment. Here are a few things to investigate:\n\n1. **Response Handling**: Ensure that your Flask app is correctly handling and finalizing the response. A common problem is not using `return` properly in the view functions, or not ensuring that the response is fully constructed before sending. Double-check that your response is being returned correctly from the function.\n\n2. **Gunicorn Worker Timeout**: Check if the Gunicorn workers are timing out. Sometimes, if a request takes too long to process, it can cause a timeout, and the response will not be sent. You may consider increasing the timeout or optimizing the request handling.\n\n3. **Gunicorn Configuration**: Ensure that Gunicorn is configured to handle the desired number of workers and threads. An inadequate number of workers may result in unprocessed requests.\n\n4. **Middleware or WSGI Issues**: If you have any middleware or WSGI configurations, ensure they are not causing issues in processing or sending the response.\n\n5. **App Server Logs**: Check Gunicorn and Heroku logs for any warnings or errors besides the snippets you've provided. Sometimes, underlying issues might be logged elsewhere.\n\n6. **Heroku Dyno Restarts**: Check if there are any dyno restarts around the time of these 0-byte responses. Dyno restarts could lead to interrupted responses.\n\n7. **Network Issues**: Although less likely, consider if there could be intermittent network issues affecting the delivery of responses between Heroku and the client.\n\n8. **Debugging**: To gather more information, you could enable more verbose logging temporarily to see if there are any hidden warnings or errors.\n\n9. **Heroku Support**: If none of the above resolves the issue, consider reaching out to Heroku support with detailed logs and descriptions.\n\nBy carefully checking these areas, you should be able to identify the root cause of the issue and address it accordingly."
