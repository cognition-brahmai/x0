I previously thought that 'os.sep' could provide this, but it only returns the separator for components of a directory or filename, such as '\\\\' or '/'."

The `os.pathsep` attribute provides the correct separator for PATH-like environment variables, which is `';'` on Windows and `':'` on Unix-based systems like Linux and macOS.\n\nHere's how you can use it in your Python code:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\npath_separator = os.pathsep\nprint(f\"The PATH separator for this operating system is: '{path_separator}'\")\n```\n\nThis will print the appropriate separator based on the operating system on which the Python script is being executed."
