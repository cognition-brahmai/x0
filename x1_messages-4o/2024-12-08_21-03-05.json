        "content": "Certainly! To achieve this, we need to modify the existing Swift code to include data structures that capture both the categorization and frequency of each word. We can use a dictionary to store categories and another dictionary to track the frequency of each word. Finally, we'll display the results in a table format sorted by frequency. Here's a complete implementation:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\n// Define a type alias for the category dictionary\ntypealias CategoryDict = [String: [String]]\n\n// Define a type alias for the frequency dictionary\ntypealias FrequencyDict = [String: Int]\n\n// Function to categorize words and capture their frequency\nfunc categorizeWords(words: [String]) -> (CategoryDict, FrequencyDict) {\n    var categories: CategoryDict = [:]\n    var frequencies: FrequencyDict = [:]\n    \n    for word in words {\n        // Determine the category for the word (for simplicity, use the first letter)\n        let category = String(word.prefix(1)).uppercased()\n        \n        // Add the word to the category\n        if categories[category] != nil {\n            categories[category]?.append(word)\n        } else {\n            categories[category] = [word]\n        }\n        \n        // Update the frequency of the word\n        frequencies[word, default: 0] += 1\n    }\n    \n    return (categories, frequencies)\n}\n\n// Function to display the results in a table format\nfunc displayResults(categories: CategoryDict, frequencies: FrequencyDict) {\n    // Sort the words by frequency in descending order\n    let sortedWords = frequencies.sorted { $0.value > $1.value }\n    \n    print(String(format: \"%-10s %-30s %-10s\", \"Category\", \"Words\", \"Frequency\"))\n    print(String(repeating: \"-\", count: 50))\n    \n    for (word, frequency) in sortedWords {\n        for (category, words) in categories {\n            if words.contains(word) {\n                print(String(format: \"%-10s %-30s %-10d\", category, word, frequency))\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage\nlet words = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"avocado\", \"blueberry\", \"apple\", \"banana\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"apple\"]\nlet (categories, frequencies) = categorizeWords(words: words)\ndisplayResults(categories: categories, frequencies: frequencies)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Data Structures:**\n   - `CategoryDict`: A dictionary that maps categories to a list of words belonging to each category.\n   - `FrequencyDict`: A dictionary that maps each word to its frequency count.\n\n2. **Categorization:**\n   - Words are categorized based on their first letter. This can be customized based on your criteria.\n\n3. **Frequency Calculation:**\n   - The frequency of each word is updated as we iterate through the list of words.\n\n4. **Sorting and Display:**\n   - Words are sorted by their frequency in descending order.\n   - Results are displayed in a tabular format with columns for category, word, and frequency.\n\nYou can customize the categorization logic as needed, depending on how you want to group your words."
