But, I'm facing an issue where the model provides varied results when predicting on the training data, but it gives the same prediction result for every testing input. What could be the reason for this and how can I get varied results for the testing data prediction too? Here is my code and the dataset I'm using is the IMDB 5000 Movie Dataset."

        "content": "When your Support Vector Regression (SVR) model gives the same prediction for every input in the test set, it often indicates that the model is not well-tuned or that there might be an issue with the preprocessing of your data. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and improve your model:\n\n1. **Check Data Preprocessing:**\n   - **Feature Scaling:** Ensure that your features are properly scaled, as SVR is sensitive to the scale of the input data. Use `StandardScaler` or `MinMaxScaler` from Scikit-Learn to scale your features.\n   - **Imbalanced Data:** Check if your training data is imbalanced in terms of the target variable. If most of your training data has similar IMDB scores, the model might learn to predict the mean or median value.\n\n2. **Model Parameters:**\n   - **Kernel Choice:** Experiment with different kernels (`'linear'`, `'poly'`, `'rbf'`, `'sigmoid'`) to see which one works best for your data. The default kernel is `'rbf'`.\n   - **Hyperparameters:** Tune the hyperparameters `C`, `epsilon`, and `gamma` (if using the `'rbf'` kernel). Use techniques like Grid Search (`GridSearchCV`) or Randomized Search (`RandomizedSearchCV`) to find the best parameters.\n\n3. **Model Complexity:**\n   - If your model is too simple (e.g., using a linear kernel with default parameters), it might not be capturing the complexity of your data well. Increasing the complexity by tuning hyperparameters or using a more expressive kernel can help.\n\n4. **Check for Overfitting or Underfitting:**\n   - If the training predictions vary but the test predictions do not, it might be a sign of overfitting. Consider using cross-validation to check the model's performance on different subsets of your data.\n\n5. **Debugging Tips:**\n   - Print the shapes of your training and test datasets to make sure they are as expected.\n   - Visualize your data and predictions to gain insights.\n\nHere's an example of how you might set up your SVR with feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVR\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load your dataset\ndata = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_dataset.csv')\n\n# Assuming 'features' is a DataFrame with your features and 'target' is the series with IMDB scores\nX = data.drop(columns=['imdb_score'])\ny = data['imdb_score']\n\n# Train-test split\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Create a pipeline with scaling and SVR\npipeline = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), SVR())\n\n# Define the parameter grid for GridSearchCV\nparam_grid = {\n    'svr__kernel': ['linear', 'poly', 'rbf', 'sigmoid'],\n    'svr__C': [0.1, 1, 10, 100],\n    'svr__epsilon': [0.01, 0.1, 0.2],\n    'svr__gamma': ['scale', 'auto']\n}\n\n# Perform Grid Search\ngrid_search = GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid, cv=5, scoring='neg_mean_squared_error')\ngrid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Best parameters and score\nprint(\"Best parameters:\", grid_search.best_params_)\nprint(\"Best cross-validated score:\", grid_search.best_score_)\n\n# Predict on the test set\ny_pred = grid_search.predict(X_test)\n\n# Check predictions\nprint(\"Predictions on test set:\", y_pred)\n```\n\nBy following these steps and adjusting the model parameters, you should be able to get more varied and accurate predictions on your testing data."
