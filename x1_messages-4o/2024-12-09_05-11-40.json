The code snippet is as follows: \n\n```python\ndf = df[~df['InvoiceNo'].str.contains('C')]\n```\n\nCan someone explain the purpose and usage of the tilde sign in this context?"

        "content": "Certainly! In the context of the code snippet you provided, the tilde sign (`~`) is used as a bitwise NOT operator in Pandas. It is used to invert a boolean Series or array, essentially flipping `True` to `False` and vice versa.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what the code does:\n\n1. `df['InvoiceNo'].str.contains('C')`: This part of the code checks each value in the `InvoiceNo` column of the DataFrame `df` to see if it contains the letter `'C'`. It returns a boolean Series where each entry corresponds to whether the condition is `True` or `False`.\n\n2. `~df['InvoiceNo'].str.contains('C')`: The tilde sign inverts the boolean Series. So, every `True` becomes `False` and every `False` becomes `True`. This means you are now selecting rows where the `InvoiceNo` does **not** contain the letter `'C'`.\n\n3. `df = df[~df['InvoiceNo'].str.contains('C')]`: Finally, this line filters the DataFrame `df` to include only those rows where the `InvoiceNo` does not contain the letter `'C'`. The result is assigned back to `df`, effectively removing any rows that had `InvoiceNo` with the letter `'C'`.\n\nIn summary, the tilde (`~`) is used here to exclude rows from the DataFrame based on the specified condition."
