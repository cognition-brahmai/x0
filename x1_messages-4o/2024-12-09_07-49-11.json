Specifically, I have this abstract base class:\n\n```python\nimport abc\n\nclass Abstract(object):\n\n    __metaclass__ = abc.ABCMeta\n\n    @abc.abstractproperty\n    def id(self):\n        return   \n\n    @abc.abstractmethod\n    def foo(self):\n        return \"foo\"\n\n    def bar(self):\n        return \"bar\"\n```\n\nIs it possible to test the method `bar` without creating any subclasses of the base class? I know I could test on all concrete subclasses of the base class, but that seems excessive in some scenarios."

        "content": "In Python, abstract base classes (ABCs) cannot be instantiated directly, as they are designed to be subclassed. However, you can create a temporary subclass within your test code specifically for testing purposes. This allows you to test the concrete methods of the abstract base class without creating full-fledged subclasses.\n\nHere's how you can test the `bar` method without creating permanent subclasses:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\n\nclass Abstract(object):\n    __metaclass__ = abc.ABCMeta\n\n    @abc.abstractproperty\n    def id(self):\n        return   \n\n    @abc.abstractmethod\n    def foo(self):\n        return \"foo\"\n\n    def bar(self):\n        return \"bar\"\n\n# Test case for the Abstract class\nclass TestAbstract(unittest.TestCase):\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create a temporary subclass for testing\n        class Concrete(Abstract):\n            @property\n            def id(self):\n                return 1\n\n            def foo(self):\n                return \"concrete foo\"\n\n        self.concrete_instance = Concrete()\n\n    def test_bar(self):\n        # Test the bar method\n        self.assertEqual(self.concrete_instance.bar(), \"bar\")\n\n# Run the tests\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Temporary Subclass for Testing**: \n   - In the `setUp` method of your test case, create a temporary subclass `Concrete` that implements all abstract methods and properties of the abstract base class.\n   - This subclass is only for testing purposes and is not part of your main application code.\n\n2. **Instantiation**:\n   - Instantiate the temporary subclass and store it in an instance variable (e.g., `self.concrete_instance`).\n\n3. **Testing Concrete Methods**:\n   - Use this instance to test the concrete methods like `bar`.\n\nBy using this approach, you ensure that you can test the `bar` method without creating extensive subclasses, keeping your tests clean and focused on the functionality you want to verify."
