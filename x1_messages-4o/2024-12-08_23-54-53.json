These systems are designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. AI technology encompasses a range of techniques, including machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, and computer vision, enabling computers to process data, identify patterns, and improve their performance over time. The goal of AI is to create systems that can function autonomously and efficiently in various environments and applications."
