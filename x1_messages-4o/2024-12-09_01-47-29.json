I can iterate over both of them, and they return the same list of files. Here is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nfrom glob import glob, iglob\n\nfor fn in glob('/*'):\n    print fn\n\nprint ''\n\nfor fn in iglob('/*'):\n    print fn\n```\nI have read the Python documentation for both [glob()](http://docs.python.org/library/glob.html) and [Iterator](http://docs.python.org/glossary.html#term-iterator), but I am still unclear on the benefits of using iglob() over glob(). Does iglob() provide any additional functionality compared to a simple list?"

        "content": "The primary difference between `glob()` and `iglob()` in Python's `glob` module is the type of object they return and how they handle memory and performance.\n\n1. **Return Type**:\n   - `glob()`: Returns a list of all matching file paths. Once the list is generated, it is stored entirely in memory.\n   - `iglob()`: Returns an iterator that generates each file path one at a time, as you iterate over it. This means that it doesn't store all the file paths in memory at once.\n\n2. **Memory Efficiency**:\n   - `glob()`: Because it stores the entire list of file paths in memory, it can be less memory efficient, especially when dealing with a large number of files.\n   - `iglob()`: More memory efficient when dealing with a large number of files because it generates file paths on-the-fly.\n\n3. **Performance**:\n   - With `glob()`, the entire list of file paths is created immediately, which can cause a delay if there are many files.\n   - With `iglob()`, file paths are generated as needed, which can reduce the initial delay and spread the work over the iteration.\n\n4. **Use Cases**:\n   - Use `glob()` when you need to access the entire list of files at once, such as when you need to sort or batch process them.\n   - Use `iglob()` when you are processing files one at a time and want to conserve memory, or when you are working with a potentially large number of files.\n\nIn summary, `iglob()` is beneficial in scenarios where memory usage is a concern or when you want to start processing files immediately as they are found, rather than waiting for the entire list to be generated. It\u2019s particularly useful in large-scale data processing or file system operations."
