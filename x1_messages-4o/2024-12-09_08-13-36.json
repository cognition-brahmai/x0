For example, I have a list, `mylist = ['10', '12', '14']`, and I want to format this list such that each element appears on a separate line, without the brackets, commas and quotation marks.

Here's how you can do it with your list `mylist`:\n\n```python\nmylist = ['10', '12', '14']\n\nfor element in mylist:\n    print(element)\n```\n\nThis loop will print each element of the list on a new line, producing the following output:\n\n```\n10\n12\n14\n```\n\nEach element is printed individually, so there are no brackets, commas, or quotation marks."
