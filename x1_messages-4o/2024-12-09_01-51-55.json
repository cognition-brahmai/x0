        "content": "To round numbers in your list to the nearest 1000, you can use a simple function that utilizes Python's built-in `round()` function with a specific rounding factor. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef round_to_nearest_1000(number):\n    return round(number, -3)\n\nrev_list = []\n\nfor i in range(12):\n    rev = int(round(random.normalvariate(100000, 12000)))\n    rev_list.append(round_to_nearest_1000(rev))\n\nprint(rev_list)\n```\n\nIn this revised code:\n- I've defined a function `round_to_nearest_1000()` that rounds a given number to the nearest 1000. The key is using `round(number, -3)`, where `-3` indicates rounding to the nearest thousand.\n- The numbers generated by `random.normalvariate()` are rounded to the nearest 1000 before being appended to `rev_list`.\n\nWhen you run this code, the output list will contain numbers rounded to the nearest thousand."
