Currently, I am using a method that seems to be slow and inelegant. In this method, for a given x, I am generating strings of 1s and 0s of length x. For example, for x = 1, I am getting ['0','1'] and for x = 2, I am getting ['00','01','10','11']. I am looking for a solution that would ideally be fast and require fewer iterations. Here is the code I am currently using:\n\n```python\nself.nbits = n\nitems = []\nfor x in xrange(n+1):\n    ones = x\n    zeros = n-x\n    item = []\n    for i in xrange(ones):\n        item.append(1)\n    for i in xrange(zeros):\n        item.append(0)\n    items.append(item)\nperms = set()\nfor item in items:\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(item):\n        perms.add(perm)\nperms = list(perms)\nperms.sort()\nself.to_bits = {}\nself.to_code = {}\nfor x in enumerate(perms):\n    self.to_bits[x[0]] = ''.join([str(y) for y in x[1]])\n    self.to_code[''.join([str(y) for y in x[1]])] = x[0]\n```"

        "content": "To generate all possible permutations of a binary sequence of length `x` efficiently, you can leverage Python's `itertools.product`, which can generate the Cartesian product of the input iterables. This is a much more direct and efficient approach for this particular problem, as it generates all combinations of the specified elements directly without needing to explicitly permute them.\n\nHere's a more efficient and elegant solution using `itertools.product`:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef generate_binary_permutations(n):\n    # Generate all binary sequences of length n\n    perms = list(itertools.product([0, 1], repeat=n))\n\n    # Convert tuples to strings and create mappings\n    to_bits = {}\n    to_code = {}\n    \n    for index, perm in enumerate(perms):\n        # Convert each tuple to a string\n        bit_string = ''.join(map(str, perm))\n        \n        # Create mappings\n        to_bits[index] = bit_string\n        to_code[bit_string] = index\n\n    return to_bits, to_code\n\n# Example usage\nn = 2\nto_bits, to_code = generate_binary_permutations(n)\nprint(to_bits)\nprint(to_code)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **itertools.product**: This function is used to generate the Cartesian product of input iterables. By specifying `[0, 1]` repeated `n` times, we effectively generate all `2^n` combinations of binary sequences.\n\n2. **Mapping**: We create two dictionaries, `to_bits` and `to_code`. `to_bits` maps indices to binary strings, and `to_code` maps binary strings back to their indices.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: This method directly generates all possible combinations without the need to create intermediate lists of ones and zeros and then permuting them. It is more efficient and concise for generating binary sequences.\n\nThis approach provides a clean and efficient way to generate all possible permutations of a binary sequence of length `n`."
