In that book, I came across the following example using the ggplot2 package in R:\n\n```R\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nggplot(data = diamonds) + \nstat_summary(\n    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),\n    fun.ymin = min,\n    fun.ymax = max,\n    fun.y = median\n)\n```\n\nI'm trying to replicate this plot using the appropriate geom_ function. It seems that the default geom for stat_summary is pointrange. However, when I attempt to use geom_pointrange, I'm not seeing the min and max points on the plot as I would expect. Here's the code I used:\n\n```R\nggplot(data = diamonds) + geom_pointrange(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth), stat = \"summary\")\n```\n\nCan someone guide me on how to use geom_pointrange to get the exact plot as the one in the example?"

        "content": "In the code you've provided, the key issue is specifying the summary functions (for minimum, maximum, and median) explicitly when using `geom_pointrange`. By default, `geom_pointrange` might not know which summary statistics to use unless they're specified.\n\nHere's how you can achieve that using `geom_pointrange` with `stat_summary`:\n\n```R\nggplot(data = diamonds) +\n  stat_summary(\n    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),\n    fun.ymin = min,\n    fun.ymax = max,\n    fun.y = median,\n    geom = \"pointrange\"\n  )\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can directly use `geom_pointrange` and specify the `fun.ymin`, `fun.ymax`, and `fun.y` within `stat_summary`. This effectively tells `geom_pointrange` to calculate the min, max, and median for each group defined by `x`:\n\n```R\nggplot(data = diamonds) + \n  geom_pointrange(\n    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),\n    stat = \"summary\",\n    fun.ymin = min,\n    fun.ymax = max,\n    fun.y = median\n  )\n```\n\nThis should give you the plot with the min, max, and median values for `depth` for each `cut` category."
