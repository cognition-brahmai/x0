I have a dataframe that contains order data, where each order has multiple packages stored as comma-separated strings in the 'package' and 'package_code' columns. I want to split the packages data and create a row for each package including its order details. For instance, I start with a dataframe like this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    \"order_id\":[1,3,7],\n    \"order_date\":[\"20/5/2018\",\"22/5/2018\",\"23/5/2018\"], \n    \"package\":[\"p1,p2,p3\",\"p4\",\"p5,p6\"],\n    \"package_code\":[\"#111,#222,#333\",\"#444\",\"#555,#666\"]\n})\n```\n\nI want to transform this dataframe such that each package and its corresponding package code have their own row, while preserving the order details. How can I do this using pandas?"

        "content": "To achieve this, you can use the `pandas` library to split the comma-separated values in the 'package' and 'package_code' columns and then explode them into separate rows. Here's a step-by-step guide to transform your dataframe:\n\n1. Use the `str.split()` method to split the strings in the 'package' and 'package_code' columns into lists.\n2. Use the `DataFrame.explode()` function to create a row for each element in the lists, while keeping the other columns intact.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create the initial dataframe\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    \"order_id\": [1, 3, 7],\n    \"order_date\": [\"20/5/2018\", \"22/5/2018\", \"23/5/2018\"], \n    \"package\": [\"p1,p2,p3\", \"p4\", \"p5,p6\"],\n    \"package_code\": [\"#111,#222,#333\", \"#444\", \"#555,#666\"]\n})\n\n# Split the 'package' and 'package_code' columns by comma\ndf['package'] = df['package'].str.split(',')\ndf['package_code'] = df['package_code'].str.split(',')\n\n# Use explode to create a row for each package\ndf_exploded = df.explode(['package', 'package_code'])\n\n# Display the transformed dataframe\nprint(df_exploded)\n```\n\nAfter running this code, `df_exploded` will be:\n\n```\n   order_id order_date package package_code\n0         1  20/5/2018      p1         #111\n0         1  20/5/2018      p2         #222\n0         1  20/5/2018      p3         #333\n1         3  22/5/2018      p4         #444\n2         7  23/5/2018      p5         #555\n2         7  23/5/2018      p6         #666\n```\n\nThis transformation maintains the association between each package and its corresponding package code, along with the order details."
