        "content": "If you don't have access to FFmpeg on your shared hosting solution, you can try using Python libraries that can extract video metadata without FFmpeg. One such library is `moviepy`, which can read video durations for various formats, including MP4, AVI, and MOV. You'll need to ensure that Python and the required libraries are supported on your hosting environment. Here's how you can use `moviepy` to get the duration of a video:\n\n1. **Install moviepy**: First, you need to install the `moviepy` library. You can do this via pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install moviepy\n   ```\n\n2. **Get video duration**: Use the following code to get the duration of a video:\n\n   ```python\n   from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip\n\n   def get_video_duration(file_path):\n       try:\n           with VideoFileClip(file_path) as video:\n               duration = video.duration  # Duration in seconds\n           return duration\n       except Exception as e:\n           print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n           return None\n\n   video_path = \"path_to_your_video.mp4\"\n   duration = get_video_duration(video_path)\n   if duration:\n       print(f\"Duration: {duration} seconds\")\n   else:\n       print(\"Could not determine video duration.\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Note**: The `moviepy` library has some dependencies, including `imageio` and `numpy`, which should be installed automatically with `moviepy`. Ensure that your environment supports these libraries.\n\nKeep in mind that `moviepy` might not support every aspect of video processing that `FFmpeg` does, but it should work well for reading basic metadata like duration. If `moviepy` is not feasible due to environment restrictions, you might need to consider alternative hosting solutions that allow FFmpeg or similar tools."
