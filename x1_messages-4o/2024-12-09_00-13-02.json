        "content": "To achieve the task of identifying proper and common nouns from a sentence and displaying their frequencies, you'll need to follow a multi-step process. Since the command line doesn't directly support natural language processing (NLP), you can use a combination of tools like Python scripts and command-line utilities. Here's a general approach using Python and some command-line tools:\n\n1. **Install Required Python Libraries**: Ensure you have `nltk` installed. You can install it using pip if it's not already available:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install nltk\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a Python Script**: Write a Python script to process the sentence and identify nouns using `nltk`. Save this script as `identify_nouns.py`.\n\n   ```python\n   import nltk\n   from nltk import pos_tag, word_tokenize\n   from collections import Counter\n\n   # Download the necessary resources\n   nltk.download('punkt')\n   nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')\n\n   def identify_nouns(sentence):\n       # Tokenize and tag parts of speech\n       tokens = word_tokenize(sentence)\n       tagged = pos_tag(tokens)\n\n       proper_nouns = []\n       common_nouns = []\n\n       # Categorize nouns\n       for word, tag in tagged:\n           if tag == 'NNP':  # Proper noun, singular\n               proper_nouns.append(word)\n           elif tag in ['NN', 'NNS']:  # Common noun, singular or plural\n               common_nouns.append(word)\n\n       # Count the frequency of each noun\n       proper_noun_count = Counter(proper_nouns)\n       common_noun_count = Counter(common_nouns)\n\n       return proper_noun_count, common_noun_count\n\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       sentence = \"This world is full of surprises\"\n       proper_nouns, common_nouns = identify_nouns(sentence)\n\n       print(\"Proper Nouns:\")\n       for noun, count in proper_nouns.most_common():\n           print(f\"- {noun} ({count})\")\n\n       print(\"Common Nouns:\")\n       for noun, count in common_nouns.most_common():\n           print(f\"- {noun} ({count})\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Run the Python Script**: Execute the script from the shell to get the desired output.\n\n   ```bash\n   python identify_nouns.py\n   ```\n\nThe script uses `nltk` to tokenize the sentence and tag each word's part of speech. It then categorizes words as proper or common nouns based on their POS tags (`NNP` for proper nouns and `NN`/`NNS` for common nouns) and counts their occurrences. Finally, it prints the nouns and their frequencies in descending order.\n\nThis approach assumes a basic level of NLP processing, and for more complex sentences or languages, additional NLP models or libraries might be required."
