However, `json.load()` just reads until end-of-file and there doesn't seem to be a way to use it to read a single object or to lazily iterate over the objects. Is there a way to do this, preferably using the standard library or a third-party library? Currently, I'm putting each object on a separate line and using `json.loads(f.readline())`, but I would prefer not to do this. \n\nConsider this example:\n\nexample.py\n```\nimport my_json as json\nimport sys\n\nfor o in json.iterload(sys.stdin):\n    print(\"Working on a\", type(o))\n```\nin.txt\n```\n{\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} 1 2 [] 4 5 6\n```\nexample session\n```\n$ python3.2 example.py < in.txt\nWorking on a dict\nWorking on a int\nWorking on a int\nWorking on a list\nWorking on a int\nWorking on a int\nWorking on a int\n```"

        "content": "To achieve this functionality, you can use the `ijson` library, which is a third-party library that allows for lazy parsing of JSON data. It works well for streaming and can parse JSON objects one at a time from a file or stream.\n\nFirst, you'll need to install the `ijson` library if you haven't already. You can do this using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install ijson\n```\n\nThen, you can create a function similar to `json.iterload`, which will read and parse the JSON objects one at a time. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport ijson\n\ndef iterload(file):\n    parser = ijson.parse(file)\n    for prefix, event, value in parser:\n        if event == 'start_map':\n            yield next_object(parser, prefix)\n        elif event == 'number':\n            yield value\n        elif event in ('string', 'boolean', 'null'):\n            yield value\n\ndef next_object(parser, prefix):\n    result = {}\n    for prefix, event, value in parser:\n        if event == 'end_map':\n            return result\n        elif event == 'map_key':\n            key = value\n        elif event in ('string', 'number', 'boolean', 'null'):\n            result[key] = value\n        elif event == 'start_map':\n            result[key] = next_object(parser, prefix)\n        elif event == 'start_array':\n            result[key] = next_array(parser, prefix)\n\ndef next_array(parser, prefix):\n    result = []\n    for prefix, event, value in parser:\n        if event == 'end_array':\n            return result\n        elif event in ('string', 'number', 'boolean', 'null'):\n            result.append(value)\n        elif event == 'start_map':\n            result.append(next_object(parser, prefix))\n        elif event == 'start_array':\n            result.append(next_array(parser, prefix))\n\n# Usage example\nimport sys\n\nwith open('in.txt', 'r') as f:\n    for obj in iterload(f):\n        print(\"Working on a\", type(obj))\n```\n\nThis script uses `ijson.parse` to lazily iterate through the JSON tokens. It handles start and end events for objects and arrays to construct the JSON objects incrementally. This way, you can process each JSON value or object as it's read from the file or stream, without loading everything into memory at once.\n\n### Explanation:\n- `iterload(file)`: This function initializes the parser and iterates through the parsed events. It yields JSON objects or values one by one.\n- `next_object(parser, prefix)`: This function constructs a JSON object by listening for key-value pairs and handling nested objects and arrays.\n- `next_array(parser, prefix)`: This function constructs a JSON array by appending values and handling nested structures.\n\nUsing `ijson` allows you to efficiently handle large JSON data streams without loading them entirely into memory, which is particularly useful for processing large datasets or continuous streams of JSON data."
