I have set `app.run(debug=True)` in my Flask file and deployed it using uWSGI and Nginx by following the instructions provided in a link. The command I used for uWSGI is `uwsgi -s /tmp/uwsgi.sock -w flask_file_name:app -H /path/to/virtual/env --chmod-socket 666`. However, when an error occurs, I'm not receiving any debug information either in the browser or the uWSGI log. What could be the issue and how can I solve it? Here is my Flask file for reference:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, make_response, Response, jsonify\nimport json\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.debug = True\n\n@app.route(\"/\")\ndef hello():\n    return \"Hello World!\"\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run()\n```"

        "content": "When deploying a Flask application with uWSGI and Nginx, setting `app.debug = True` or using `app.run(debug=True)` won't enable the interactive debugger in the same way it does when running the Flask development server directly. This is because uWSGI is designed for production use, and enabling the debugger in production is generally not recommended due to security risks.\n\nHowever, if you need to enable debug mode for development purposes, you can use the following methods:\n\n### 1. Enable Debug Mode in uWSGI Configuration\nYou can enable the Flask debug mode by setting the `FLASK_ENV` environment variable to `development` before starting uWSGI. This will ensure that Flask is aware that you want to run in debug mode.\n\n1. **Set Environment Variable:**\n\n   You can set the environment variable in your shell or in your uWSGI configuration file.\n\n   - **Shell Method:**\n     ```bash\n     export FLASK_ENV=development\n     uwsgi --socket /tmp/uwsgi.sock -w flask_file_name:app -H /path/to/virtual/env --chmod-socket 666\n     ```\n\n   - **uWSGI Configuration File Method:**\n     Create a `uwsgi.ini` file or similar configuration file:\n\n     ```ini\n     [uwsgi]\n     module = flask_file_name:app\n     socket = /tmp/uwsgi.sock\n     chmod-socket = 666\n     virtualenv = /path/to/virtual/env\n     env = FLASK_ENV=development\n     ```\n\n     Then start uWSGI with this configuration file:\n\n     ```bash\n     uwsgi --ini uwsgi.ini\n     ```\n\n### 2. Use Werkzeug's Debugger\nAnother approach is to use the Werkzeug debugger during development. This is not recommended for production use, but it can be useful for debugging.\n\n1. **Install Debug Middleware:**\n\n   You can wrap your Flask app with Werkzeug's debugger middleware:\n\n   ```python\n   from werkzeug.debug import DebuggedApplication\n\n   app = Flask(__name__)\n   app.debug = True\n\n   if __name__ != '__main__':\n       app.wsgi_app = DebuggedApplication(app.wsgi_app, evalex=True)\n\n   @app.route(\"/\")\n   def hello():\n       return \"Hello World!\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Run uWSGI:**\n\n   Run uWSGI as usual. The Werkzeug debugger should now be activated.\n\n### 3. Logging Errors to the Console\nEnsure that your uWSGI configuration is set to log errors to the console or a file:\n\n- Add `--logto /path/to/error.log` to your uWSGI command or configuration file to log errors to a file.\n\n```bash\nuwsgi --socket /tmp/uwsgi.sock -w flask_file_name:app -H /path/to/virtual/env --chmod-socket 666 --logto /path/to/error.log\n```\n\n### 4. Use a Development Server\nFinally, for full debugging capabilities, you might consider running a separate development server while you debug, and then deploy with uWSGI and Nginx once you're ready for production.\n\nThis approach ensures that you have access to all debugging features during development without compromising the security of your production environment."
