Everything appears to be functioning correctly as per the Apache error log. However, it seems that mod_wsgi for Apache 2.4, which I installed using `sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3`, was compiled for Python/3.5.1+ and is using Python/3.5.2. As a result, my Python 3.6.1 code is failing because I'm using new features not available in 3.5.2. Additionally, mod_wsgi doesn't seem to be using my Python 3.6.1 virtual environment although it is trying to use it for Django according to the error log. I also tried using `./configure --with-python=/usr/local/bin/python3.6` and `make` with `make install` to install mod_wsgi for Python 3.6. What could I be doing wrong?"

        "content": "To resolve your issue with `mod_wsgi` and ensure compatibility with Python 3.6.1, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install Python 3.6.1:**\n   Make sure Python 3.6.1 is installed on your system and accessible. You can verify this by running:\n   ```bash\n   python3.6 --version\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Apache Development Tools:**\n   Ensure you have the necessary development tools for building `mod_wsgi`. You can install them using:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install apache2-dev\n   ```\n\n3. **Recompile mod_wsgi for Python 3.6.1:**\n   Since the `libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3` package you installed is compiled for Python 3.5, you will need to compile `mod_wsgi` from source for Python 3.6.1.\n\n   - First, download the `mod_wsgi` source code:\n     ```bash\n     wget https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/mod_wsgi/archive/4.7.1.tar.gz\n     tar xvf 4.7.1.tar.gz\n     cd mod_wsgi-4.7.1\n     ```\n\n   - Next, configure the build to use your Python 3.6.1 interpreter:\n     ```bash\n     ./configure --with-python=/usr/local/bin/python3.6\n     ```\n\n   - Build and install `mod_wsgi`:\n     ```bash\n     make\n     sudo make install\n     ```\n\n4. **Configure Apache to Use the New mod_wsgi:**\n   Edit your Apache configuration files to point to the newly installed `mod_wsgi` module. This might typically be done in the `/etc/apache2/mods-available/wsgi.load` file or a similar configuration file, depending on your setup. You should ensure it points to the location where `mod_wsgi` was installed, something like:\n   ```apache\n   LoadModule wsgi_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_wsgi.so\n   ```\n\n5. **Configure Django to Use the Virtual Environment:**\n   Ensure that your Django application is configured to use the correct Python virtual environment. You can set this in your Apache configuration file for your Django site, typically in the `<VirtualHost>` block:\n   ```apache\n   WSGIDaemonProcess myproject python-home=/path/to/your/venv python-path=/path/to/your/project\n   WSGIProcessGroup myproject\n   WSGIScriptAlias / /path/to/your/project/myproject/wsgi.py\n   ```\n\n   Replace `/path/to/your/venv` with the path to your Python 3.6.1 virtual environment and `/path/to/your/project` with the path to your Django project.\n\n6. **Restart Apache:**\n   Finally, restart Apache to apply the changes:\n   ```bash\n   sudo service apache2 restart\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to compile and use `mod_wsgi` with Apache that is compatible with Python 3.6.1 and ensure that your Django application runs in the specified virtual environment. If you encounter any errors during this process, make sure to check the Apache error logs for more detailed information."
