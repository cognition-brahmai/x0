        "content": "To print a tuple using string formatting in Python, you need to use the `%s` format specifier, which is used to convert any object to a string using the `str()` function. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ntup = (1, 2, 3)\nprint(\"This is a tuple %s\" % (tup,))\n```\n\nIn this example, `%s` is used to convert the tuple to a string, and the tuple is passed as a single argument in parentheses to ensure it's treated as a single object for formatting. This will output:\n\n```\nThis is a tuple (1, 2, 3)\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use newer formatting methods such as `str.format()` or f-strings (available in Python 3.6 and later):\n\nUsing `str.format()`:\n\n```python\ntup = (1, 2, 3)\nprint(\"This is a tuple {}\".format(tup))\n```\n\nUsing f-strings:\n\n```python\ntup = (1, 2, 3)\nprint(f\"This is a tuple {tup}\")\n```\n\nBoth of these will also output:\n\n```\nThis is a tuple (1, 2, 3)\n```"
