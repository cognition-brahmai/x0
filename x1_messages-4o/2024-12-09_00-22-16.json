However, when I try to combine them using `soda = \"a\" + \"b\"`, the output I get is `'ab'`. I want the output to be `'lemonlime'`. How can this be achieved?"

To concatenate the values of the variables `a` and `b`, you need to remove the quotes around `a` and `b` in the expression. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\na = 'lemon'\nb = 'lime'\nsoda = a + b\n```\n\nNow, the value of `soda` will be `'lemonlime'`, which is the result you are looking for."
