For example, I have the following dictionary:\n\n```python\ndict = {'Adam' : (10, '2002-08-13'),\n        'Eve'  : (40, '1972-08-13')}\n```\n\nI would like to delete all the keys in my dictionary where the age (the first element in the value tuple) is greater than 30. I am currently accessing the age of each key using the syntax `dict[name][0]`. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To remove keys from a dictionary based on a condition, you can use a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that only includes the items you want to keep. Here's how you can do it for your specific case:\n\n```python\n# Original dictionary\ndata = {\n    'Adam': (10, '2002-08-13'),\n    'Eve': (40, '1972-08-13')\n}\n\n# Create a new dictionary excluding entries where age is greater than 30\nfiltered_data = {name: info for name, info in data.items() if info[0] <= 30}\n\n# Assign the filtered dictionary back to the original variable if needed\ndata = filtered_data\n\n# Print the result\nprint(data)\n```\n\nThis code snippet creates a new dictionary `filtered_data` that only includes entries from the original dictionary `data` where the age (first element of the tuple) is 30 or less. The `if info[0] <= 30` condition is used to filter out entries where the age is greater than 30. Finally, it assigns the filtered result back to `data` if you want to update the original dictionary."
