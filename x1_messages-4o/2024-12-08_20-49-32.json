        "content": "Certainly! To create a Ruby program that generates a command in Spanish for ordering a cup of tea with specified temperature and steeping time, you can follow these steps. This program will ensure that the command is easily understandable for Spanish speakers by using clear and concise Spanish language.\n\nHere's a sample Ruby code:\n\n```ruby\n# Define a method to create a tea order command in Spanish\ndef tea_order_command(temperature, steeping_time)\n  # Ensure the inputs are of the correct type\n  raise 'Temperature must be a number' unless temperature.is_a?(Numeric)\n  raise 'Steeping time must be a number' unless steeping_time.is_a?(Numeric)\n\n  # Create the command string in Spanish\n  command = \"Por favor, prepare una taza de t\u00e9 a #{temperature} grados Celsius y d\u00e9jela reposar durante #{steeping_time} minutos para una preparaci\u00f3n \u00f3ptima.\"\n\n  # Return the command\n  command\nend\n\n# Example usage\ntemperature = 80 # Temperature in Celsius\nsteeping_time = 5 # Steeping time in minutes\n\n# Generate the command\ncommand = tea_order_command(temperature, steeping_time)\n\n# Output the command\nputs command\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Method Definition**: The `tea_order_command` method takes two parameters: `temperature` and `steeping_time`. These parameters allow you to specify the desired temperature and steeping time for the tea.\n- **Input Validation**: The method checks if the inputs are numbers, raising an error if they are not. This ensures that the inputs are appropriate for generating the command.\n- **Command String**: The command string is constructed in Spanish using string interpolation to include the temperature and steeping time in the sentence.\n- **Example Usage**: Replace the `temperature` and `steeping_time` variables with the desired values, and the method will generate the appropriate command in Spanish.\n\nThis code will output a command like:\n```\nPor favor, prepare una taza de t\u00e9 a 80 grados Celsius y d\u00e9jela reposar durante 5 minutos para una preparaci\u00f3n \u00f3ptima.\n```\n\nThis sentence is straightforward and should be easily understandable for Spanish speakers. You can adjust the temperature and steeping time as needed for different orders."
