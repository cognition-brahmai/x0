        "content": "As of the latest data, the five most common types of investments are:\n\n1. **Stocks/Equities**: Shares of ownership in a company.\n2. **Bonds**: Debt securities issued by entities such as governments or corporations.\n3. **Real Estate**: Property investments for income or capital appreciation.\n4. **Mutual Funds/ETFs**: Pooled investment vehicles that allow investors to buy a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities.\n5. **Cryptocurrencies**: Digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography for security.\n\nTo create a PHP code snippet that identifies these types of investments, you can create an associative array and a function to match a given investment type with the list:\n\n```php\n<?php\n\nfunction identifyInvestmentType($investmentType) {\n    $commonInvestments = [\n        'stocks' => 'Stocks/Equities',\n        'bonds' => 'Bonds',\n        'real_estate' => 'Real Estate',\n        'mutual_funds' => 'Mutual Funds/ETFs',\n        'cryptocurrencies' => 'Cryptocurrencies'\n    ];\n\n    $key = strtolower(str_replace(' ', '_', $investmentType));\n\n    if (array_key_exists($key, $commonInvestments)) {\n        return $commonInvestments[$key];\n    } else {\n        return \"Investment type not recognized.\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n$investmentType = \"Stocks\";\necho identifyInvestmentType($investmentType); // Outputs: Stocks/Equities\n\n?>\n```\n\nThis code snippet creates an array of common investments and checks if a given investment type exists within that array. If it does, it returns the investment name; otherwise, it states that the type is not recognized."
