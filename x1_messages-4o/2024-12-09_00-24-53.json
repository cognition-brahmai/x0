This functionality allows a yielded generator coroutine to be resumed from the caller. However, I have recently started using the new native `async/await` coroutines but I can't figure out how to perform the equivalent of the `send()` method with these. I understand that the use of `yield` in `async` functions is not allowed, so native coroutines can only return once using a `return` statement. I also understand that `await` expressions bring new values into a coroutine, but these values come from callees, not the caller. Is there a way to resume a returned coroutine from where it left off and potentially send in a new value? How can I emulate techniques like this:\n\n```python\ndef myCoroutine():\n  ...\n  while True:\n    ...\n    ping = yield(pong)\n    ...\n```\n\nAnd in the caller:\n\n```python\nwhile True:\n  ...\n  buzz = myCoroutineGen.send(bizz)\n  ...\n```\n\nMoreover, I have noticed that Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) [PEP-0492](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/#id63) mentions that native coroutines do have a `send()` method. How does it work without `yield` expression to receive the values inside the coroutine?"

        "content": "In Python, the transition from generator-based coroutines to native `async/await` coroutines introduced some changes in how you can interact with them. While generator-based coroutines use the `yield` and `send()` methods for bidirectional communication, native coroutines work differently.\n\nNative coroutines, defined with `async def`, do not use `yield` expressions, so you cannot directly use `send()` in the same way to pass values back into the coroutine from the caller. Instead, native coroutines focus on asynchronous execution and awaiting results from asynchronous calls.\n\nHowever, you can still achieve similar functionality to sending values into a coroutine using other techniques:\n\n1. **Asynchronous Generators**: If you need to iterate over generated values asynchronously, you can use asynchronous generators, which are defined with `async def` and use `yield` together with `await`. You can iterate over these using `async for`.\n\n2. **Using `asyncio.Queue` or other Data Structures**: You can use data structures such as queues to send data into a coroutine. For example, you can use an `asyncio.Queue` to send data into a coroutine from another coroutine or task. This allows you to implement producer-consumer patterns asynchronously.\n\n3. **Pass State or Data via Function Arguments**: If you need to introduce new data or state into a coroutine, you can pass it as an argument when calling the coroutine or pass it through shared objects that the coroutine can access.\n\nHere's an example of using an `asyncio.Queue` to send data into a coroutine:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def producer(queue):\n    for i in range(5):\n        await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate work\n        await queue.put(f\"ping {i}\")\n    await queue.put(None)  # Signal the consumer to stop\n\nasync def consumer(queue):\n    while True:\n        pong = await queue.get()\n        if pong is None:\n            break\n        print(f\"Received: {pong}\")\n\nasync def main():\n    queue = asyncio.Queue()\n    await asyncio.gather(producer(queue), consumer(queue))\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nIn this example, the `producer` coroutine sends data (pings) into the `queue`, and the `consumer` receives and processes them. This is a common pattern for sending data between coroutines in an asynchronous program.\n\nWhile native coroutines have a `send()` method available as part of their implementation, it is primarily intended for internal use within the Python interpreter and doesn't directly provide the same functionality as generator-based coroutines. Instead, you should use the patterns described above to achieve similar results with `async/await`."
