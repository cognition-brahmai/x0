When I try to run pytest using `python3 -m pytest ...`, I get an error that says `/usr/bin/python3: No module named pytest`. How can I run pytest using Python 3?"

        "content": "To run `pytest` under Python 3 on your Debian Linux system, you'll need to ensure that `pytest` is installed for Python 3. When you run `pytest` under Python 2.7, it's using the Python 2 version of the `pytest` module, which is why you're encountering the error when attempting to run it with Python 3.\n\nHere's how you can set it up:\n\n1. **Install `pytest` for Python 3:**\n   You can use `pip3`, the Python 3 package installer, to install `pytest` for Python 3. Open your terminal and run the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip3 install pytest\n   ```\n\n   This command installs `pytest` for Python 3.x and allows you to run it using the Python 3 interpreter.\n\n2. **Run `pytest` using Python 3:**\n   Once installed, you can run `pytest` using Python 3 by specifying the full path to the Python 3 interpreter or using `python3 -m pytest`. Use the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m pytest [options] [path]\n   ```\n\n   Replace `[options]` and `[path]` with any specific options or the path to the tests you want to run.\n\n3. **Verify the installation:**\n   To confirm that `pytest` is installed correctly for Python 3, you can check the version by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m pytest --version\n   ```\n\n   If everything is set up correctly, this should display the version of `pytest` installed for Python 3.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to run `pytest` under Python 3 without any issues. If you encounter any errors during installation, make sure that your environment is correctly set up for Python 3 and that you have the necessary permissions to install packages."
