For instance, in Python it feels tedious to write something like \"print \"foo is\" + bar + '.'. Is there a way to write this line in a more succinct, Ruby-like way such as \"print \"foo is #{bar}.\"?"

        "content": "Yes, Python provides several ways to perform variable interpolation similar to Ruby's `#{}` syntax, allowing you to write more concise and readable code. Here are a few methods:\n\n1. **f-strings (Python 3.6 and above)**: This is the most recommended and Pythonic way to perform string interpolation. You can use curly braces `{}` to embed expressions inside string literals, preceded by the letter `f`.\n\n   ```python\n   bar = \"awesome\"\n   print(f\"foo is {bar}.\")\n   ```\n\n2. **`str.format()` method**: This method allows you to insert variables into strings using curly braces `{}` and the `format()` function.\n\n   ```python\n   bar = \"awesome\"\n   print(\"foo is {}.\".format(bar))\n   ```\n\n3. **`%` formatting**: This is an older method, similar to C-style string formatting, where `%s` is a placeholder for string variables.\n\n   ```python\n   bar = \"awesome\"\n   print(\"foo is %s.\" % bar)\n   ```\n\nAmong these, f-strings are generally preferred for their readability and efficiency. They also allow for more complex expressions inside the braces."
