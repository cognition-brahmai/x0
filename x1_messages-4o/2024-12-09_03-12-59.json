What should I do to resolve this error?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to how the static methods are being referenced in the dictionary. When you define a dictionary inside a class before the class is fully constructed, it treats `open` and `proccess` as regular attributes instead of static methods, resulting in a `staticmethod` object rather than callable functions.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can populate the `switch` dictionary after the class has been fully defined. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nclass A(object):\n    @staticmethod\n    def open():\n        return 123\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def proccess():\n        return 456\n\n    # Initialize the switch dictionary as an empty dictionary\n    switch = {}\n\n\n# After the class definition, populate the switch dictionary\nA.switch = {\n    1: A.open,\n    2: A.proccess,\n}\n\n# Now the dictionary contains references to the actual static methods\nobj = A.switch[1]()\nprint(obj)  # This should output 123\n```\n\nBy moving the initialization of `switch` outside the class definition, you ensure that `open` and `proccess` are fully resolved to their static method implementations, allowing them to be called correctly."
