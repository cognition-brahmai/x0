However, when I include a new line character (\\n) within the string, it does not create a new line as expected. Instead, it draws a question mark (?) on the image. Here is the code I am using:\n\n```python\ncv2.putText(img, \"This is \\n some text\", (50,50), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, 2)\n```\n\nThe result I get from this is \"This is ? some text\". Why is the new line character not working as expected? Am I doing something wrong?"

        "content": "The `cv2.putText()` function in OpenCV does not inherently support multi-line text, including handling of newline characters like `\\n`. This function is designed to draw text in a single line only. Therefore, when you include a newline character in the string, OpenCV does not interpret it as a command to move to a new line and instead treats it as an invalid character, which is why it shows up as a question mark (`?`).\n\nTo display multi-line text, you need to manually handle the positioning of each line. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport cv2\n\n# Load or create an image\nimg = cv2.imread('path_to_your_image')  # Or use cv2.imread() if you have an image file\n\n# Define the text and split it into lines\ntext = \"This is\\nsome text\"\nlines = text.split('\\n')\n\n# Set the starting position\nx, y = 50, 50\n\n# Define the font and other properties\nfont = cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX\nfont_scale = 1\ncolor = (255, 255, 255)  # White text\nthickness = 2\nline_height = 30  # You may need to adjust this based on the font size\n\n# Loop through each line and put it on the image\nfor i, line in enumerate(lines):\n    y_position = y + i * line_height\n    cv2.putText(img, line, (x, y_position), font, font_scale, color, thickness)\n\n# Save or display the image\ncv2.imshow('Image with Text', img)\ncv2.waitKey(0)\ncv2.destroyAllWindows()\n```\n\nIn this code, we split the text into individual lines using `split('\\n')` and then draw each line at a specific vertical position calculated using the `line_height` variable. Adjusting `line_height` helps maintain the appropriate spacing between lines based on the font size."
