I am specifically trying to extract a subset of data from a column based on certain conditions being met in another column. Here is the code I'm working with:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ntst = pd.read_csv('C:\\\\SomeCSV.csv')\n\nlookupValue = tst['SomeCol'] == \"SomeValue\"\nID = tst[lookupValue][['SomeCol']]\n#How to convert ID to a list\n```\nIn this code, I'm able to get the correct values but they are in pandas.core.frame.DataFrame format. How can I convert this to a list?"

        "content": "To convert a column from a pandas `DataFrame` to a list, you can use the `.tolist()` method on a pandas `Series`. In your case, you first need to ensure you are selecting a single column as a `Series`, rather than as a `DataFrame`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ntst = pd.read_csv('C:\\\\SomeCSV.csv')\n\nlookupValue = tst['SomeCol'] == \"SomeValue\"\nID_series = tst[lookupValue]['SomeCol']  # Select as a Series\nID_list = ID_series.tolist()  # Convert to list\n\nprint(ID_list)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- `tst[lookupValue]['SomeCol']` selects the column as a `Series` instead of a `DataFrame` by specifying a single column.\n- `.tolist()` converts the `Series` into a Python list.\n\nThis will give you a list of values from the `SomeCol` column where the condition `SomeCol == \"SomeValue\"` is met."
