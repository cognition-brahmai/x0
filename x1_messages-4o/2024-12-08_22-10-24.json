        "content": "To calculate the distance between your current location and each restaurant within a 5-mile radius using the provided C++ code, you'll want to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define the Distance Function**: This function calculates the distance between two geographical points using the Haversine formula. This formula accounts for the curvature of the Earth and gives an accurate distance between two points specified by their latitude and longitude.\n\n2. **Set Your Current Location**: You'll need to input your current latitude and longitude coordinates. In the example, these are set to `37.7749` and `-122.4194`, respectively.\n\n3. **Define Restaurant Locations**: Input the latitude and longitude for each restaurant. The example already provides these details for five restaurants.\n\n4. **Calculate Distances**: Use the `distance` function to calculate the distance between your current location and each restaurant.\n\n5. **Check the Radius**: Compare each calculated distance to the specified 5-mile radius. If a restaurant is within this radius, it will be noted.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the provided code:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cmath>\nusing namespace std;\n\n// Function to calculate distance between two lat/lon points\ndouble distance(double lat1, double lon1, double lat2, double lon2) {\n    int R = 6371; // Earth's radius in kilometers\n    double dLat = (lat2 - lat1) * M_PI / 180.0;\n    double dLon = (lon2 - lon1) * M_PI / 180.0;\n    \n    // Haversine formula\n    double a = sin(dLat / 2) * sin(dLat / 2) +\n               cos(lat1 * M_PI / 180.0) * cos(lat2 * M_PI / 180.0) *\n               sin(dLon / 2) * sin(dLon / 2);\n    double c = 2 * atan2(sqrt(a), sqrt(1 - a));\n    double distance = R * c;\n    return distance * 0.621371; // Convert km to miles\n}\n\nint main() {\n    // Your current location\n    double myLat = 37.7749;\n    double myLon = -122.4194;\n    \n    // Restaurant A\n    double latA = 37.7749;\n    double lonA = -122.4194;\n    double distA = distance(myLat, myLon, latA, lonA);\n    \n    // Restaurant B\n    double latB = 37.7874;\n    double lonB = -122.4082;\n    double distB = distance(myLat, myLon, latB, lonB);\n    \n    // Restaurant C\n    double latC = 37.7912;\n    double lonC = -122.4055;\n    double distC = distance(myLat, myLon, latC, lonC);\n    \n    // Restaurant D\n    double latD = 37.7833;\n    double lonD = -122.4090;\n    double distD = distance(myLat, myLon, latD, lonD);\n    \n    // Restaurant E\n    double latE = 37.7909;\n    double lonE = -122.4041;\n    double distE = distance(myLat, myLon, latE, lonE);\n    \n    // Check if within 5-mile radius\n    if (distA <= 5.0) {\n        cout << \"Restaurant A is within a 5-mile radius.\" << endl;\n    }\n    if (distB <= 5.0) {\n        cout << \"Restaurant B is within a 5-mile radius.\" << endl;\n    }\n    if (distC <= 5.0) {\n        cout << \"Restaurant C is within a 5-mile radius.\" << endl;\n    }\n    if (distD <= 5.0) {\n        cout << \"Restaurant D is within a 5-mile radius.\" << endl;\n    }\n    if (distE <= 5.0) {\n        cout << \"Restaurant E is within a 5-mile radius.\" << endl;\n    }\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Earth's Radius**: The Earth's radius is set to 6371 kilometers. The result is converted to miles by multiplying by 0.621371.\n- **Haversine Formula**: This formula is used to calculate the great-circle distance between two points, providing an efficient way to measure distance on a sphere like Earth.\n\nMake sure you replace the latitude and longitude values with the actual locations you're interested in calculating."
