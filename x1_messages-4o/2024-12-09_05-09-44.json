        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the default log level of your `mylogger` logger, which is set to `WARNING`. This means that only log messages with a level of `WARNING` or higher will be processed unless you explicitly set a lower level for the logger itself.\n\nTo fix this, you need to set the log level of `mylogger` to `DEBUG` (or `INFO`, depending on your needs) to ensure that all log messages with a level equal to or higher than `DEBUG` are processed. Here's how you can update your code:\n\n```python\nimport logging\nimport sys\n\nmylogger = logging.getLogger(\"mylogger\")\nmylogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)  # Set the logger level to DEBUG\n\nh1 = logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout)\nh1.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)  # Set the handler level to DEBUG\n\nmylogger.addHandler(h1)\n\n# Now trying to log with the created logger\nmylogger.debug(\"This is a debug message\")  # Now this will output\nmylogger.info(\"This is an info message\")   # Now this will output\nmylogger.warning(\"This is a warning message\")  # Use warning instead of warn\n```\n\nAlso, note that `mylogger.warn()` is deprecated in favor of `mylogger.warning()`. It's a good practice to use `warning()` for consistency with the logging module's convention."
