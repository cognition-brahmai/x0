        "content": "The error you're encountering indicates that `nvcc` is having trouble locating the Visual Studio configuration file `vcvars64.bat`, which is necessary for setting up the environment variables needed for compilation. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify Visual Studio Installation**:\n   - Ensure that Visual Studio 2012 Express Edition is properly installed. The Express Edition might not include the 64-bit compiler and tools by default, which could be causing the issue.\n\n2. **Install Windows SDK**:\n   - Sometimes, the Express Edition doesn't come with a 64-bit compiler. Installing the Windows SDK can provide the necessary tools. You can download and install the Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 4, which includes these tools.\n\n3. **Update the Path Environment Variable**:\n   - Check if the path to `vcvars64.bat` is correctly set in your system's environment variables. If not, you need to manually add it. Typically, the file is located in the `VC\\bin\\amd64` directory under your Visual Studio installation path. You can update your PATH by:\n     - Right-clicking on 'This PC' or 'Computer', selecting 'Properties'.\n     - Click 'Advanced system settings'.\n     - Click 'Environment Variables'.\n     - Under 'System variables', find and select 'Path', then click 'Edit'.\n     - Add the path to `vcvars64.bat` to the list, separated by a semicolon.\n\n4. **Use Visual Studio Command Prompt**:\n   - Instead of using the standard command prompt, try using the Visual Studio Command Prompt. This command prompt automatically sets up the environment for using Visual Studio tools.\n   - You can find it in the Start Menu under Visual Studio Tools.\n\n5. **Check NVCC Configuration**:\n   - Ensure that `nvcc` is configured to use the correct version of Visual Studio. This can sometimes be configured within `nvcc.profile` located in the CUDA installation directory. Make sure the path to the Visual Studio installation is correct.\n\n6. **Reinstall CUDA Toolkit**:\n   - If none of the above solutions work, consider reinstalling the CUDA Toolkit, ensuring that during installation, you have chosen the correct Visual Studio version.\n\nBy ensuring that the necessary tools are installed and correctly configured, you should be able to resolve the error and compile your CUDA code successfully."
