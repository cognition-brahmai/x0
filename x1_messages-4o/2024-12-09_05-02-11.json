Since you are likely using Python 3, you should use the `urllib` module instead. Here's how you can modify your code to work with Python 3:\n\n```python\nimport urllib.request\n\nresponse = urllib.request.urlopen(\"http://www.google.com\")\nhtml = response.read()\nprint(html)\n```\n\nThis code uses `urllib.request` to open a URL and retrieve its HTML content. Make sure you have Python 3 installed, and this should resolve the import error you are encountering."
