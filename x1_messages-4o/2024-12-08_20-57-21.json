In exactly 150 words, describe the protagonist's journey as they navigate through treacherous waters to reach the island during the elusive time window.

As the protagonist gets closer to the island, they realize that their true test is not physical, but rather a test of their selflessness. Will they be able to prove themselves worthy and gain the crystal's power, or will their own selfish desires be their downfall?"
