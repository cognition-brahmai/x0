Here is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess as s\ns.call(\"gpio -g read 17\")\n```\n\nWhen I run this, I get the following error:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n    File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n    File \"/usr/lib/python2.6/subprocess.py\", line 470, in call\n        return Popen(*popenargs, **kwargs).wait()\n    File \"/usr/lib/python2.6/subprocess.py\", line 623, in __init__\n        errread, errwrite)\n    File \"/usr/lib/python2.6/subprocess.py\", line 1141, in _execute_child\n        raise child_exception\nOSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory\n```\n\nHowever, when I add `shell=True` to the `s.call()` function, it starts working:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess as s\ns.call(\"gpio -g read 17\", shell=True)\n```\nThis returns 0 and doesn't raise an error. Can someone explain why this happens?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to how the `subprocess.call()` function interprets the command you're trying to run. Let's break down what's happening:\n\n1. **Default Behavior of `subprocess.call()`**:\n   - When you use `subprocess.call()` without `shell=True`, it expects the command to be provided as a list of arguments. This is because, by default, `subprocess.call()` does not execute the command through a shell, and it tries to find the executable directly.\n   - In your case, `s.call(\"gpio -g read 17\")` is being passed as a single string, so Python attempts to find an executable named exactly \"gpio -g read 17\", which, of course, doesn't exist.\n\n2. **Using `shell=True`**:\n   - When you set `shell=True`, the command string is passed to the shell to be executed. This means that the shell interprets the command string, which allows for more complex commands, including those with spaces and additional arguments like what you have (\"gpio -g read 17\").\n   - This works because the shell can parse the command string and execute it correctly.\n\n3. **Correct Usage without `shell=True`**:\n   - To call the command without using the shell, you should provide the command and its arguments as a list. This allows Python to find the \"gpio\" executable and pass the arguments `-g`, `read`, and `17` to it. Here's how you can do it:\n\n    ```python\n    import subprocess as s\n    s.call([\"gpio\", \"-g\", \"read\", \"17\"])\n    ```\n\n   - This way, `subprocess.call()` directly calls the \"gpio\" executable with the specified arguments, without requiring a shell to interpret the command.\n\nTo summarize, use `shell=True` when you need shell features, but for simple command execution, it's often safer and more efficient to pass the command and arguments as a list."
