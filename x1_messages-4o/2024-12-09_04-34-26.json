        "content": "I am trying to decompress the contents of a gzip file sent to me in string-based chunks (over xmlrpc binary transfer) in a memory- and disk-limited environment. I've been using the zlib.decompress() or zlib.decompressobj()/decompress() methods, but both seem to have issues with the gzip header. I've also tried offsetting past the gzip header as documented, but I haven't managed to avoid errors. The gzip library seems to only support decompressing from files, which doesn't work in my case as the buffer is filled from xmlrpc, not a local file. Here is a simplified version of my code:\n\n```python\n#! /usr/bin/env python\n\nimport zlib\n\nCHUNKSIZE=1000\n\nd = zlib.decompressobj()\n\nf=open('23046-8.txt.gz','rb')\nbuffer=f.read(CHUNKSIZE)\n\nwhile buffer:\n  outstr = d.decompress(buffer)\n  print(outstr)\n  buffer=f.read(CHUNKSIZE)\n\noutstr = d.flush()\nprint(outstr)\n\nf.close()\n```\n\nHowever, this code results in the following error:\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"./test.py\", line 13, in &lt;module&gt;\n    outstr = d.decompress(buffer)\nzlib.error: Error -3 while decompressing: incorrect header check \n```\n\nI could theoretically feed the xmlrpc-sourced data into a StringIO and then use that as a fileobj for gzip.GzipFile(), but I don't have enough memory to hold the entire file contents in memory as well as the decompressed data. I need to process it chunk-by-chunk. I'd prefer to avoid changing the compression of my xmlrpc-sourced data from gzip to plain zlib as it impacts other sub-systems. Can you suggest a solution to this problem?"

        "content": "To decompress a gzip-compressed string in chunks without running into memory issues, you can use the `gzip` library's `GzipFile` object with a file-like interface, such as `io.BytesIO`, to handle the gzip headers properly. You\u2019ll need to process the incoming data in chunks, using a `GzipFile` object to manage the decompression. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport io\nimport gzip\n\nCHUNKSIZE = 1000\n\n# Simulate reading from a network source or similar\ndef read_in_chunks(file_object, chunk_size=CHUNKSIZE):\n    while True:\n        data = file_object.read(chunk_size)\n        if not data:\n            break\n        yield data\n\n# Simulate your XMLRPC or other source as a file-like object\nwith open('23046-8.txt.gz', 'rb') as f:\n    # Initialize GzipFile with a BytesIO object\n    decompressor = gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=io.BytesIO())\n\n    for chunk in read_in_chunks(f):\n        # Write each chunk into the BytesIO buffer of the GzipFile\n        decompressor.fileobj.write(chunk)\n        # Seek back to the beginning of the buffer to read decompressed data\n        decompressor.fileobj.seek(0)\n\n        # Decompress and read all available data\n        while True:\n            outstr = decompressor.read(CHUNKSIZE)\n            if not outstr:\n                break\n            print(outstr.decode('utf-8', errors='ignore'))\n        \n        # Clear the buffer for the next chunk\n        decompressor.fileobj.seek(0)\n        decompressor.fileobj.truncate(0)\n\n    # Flush the decompressor to get any remaining data\n    outstr = decompressor.read()\n    if outstr:\n        print(outstr.decode('utf-8', errors='ignore'))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`io.BytesIO`**: Acts as an in-memory buffer that you can use with `GzipFile` to manage decompression.\n- **`GzipFile`**: Handles gzip headers and decompression for you.\n- **Chunk Handling**: The incoming data is written to the `BytesIO` buffer in chunks, allowing `GzipFile` to process it correctly.\n- **Memory Efficiency**: By processing each chunk independently and clearing the buffer after processing, you manage memory usage efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that your decompression handles gzip headers correctly while maintaining a low memory footprint."
