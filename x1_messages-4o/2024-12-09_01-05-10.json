        "content": "You can extract the last part of a path in Python using the `os.path` module, which provides functions to manipulate and operate on file paths. Specifically, you can use the `os.path.basename` function to achieve this. Here is how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\npath = \"/folderA/folderB/folderC/folderD/\"\nlast_part = os.path.basename(os.path.normpath(path))\n\nprint(last_part)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `os.path.normpath(path)` is used to normalize the path, which removes any trailing slashes, making it easier to extract the last part.\n- `os.path.basename()` then extracts the last component of the path, which in this case is \"folderD\"."
