        "content": "To calculate the GDP contribution of Region C, we first need to understand the contribution of each region based on the number of industries and their respective average contribution rates. Let's break down the calculation based on the Swift code provided:\n\n1. **Identify the number of industries and their contribution percentage:**\n\n   - Region A: 20 industries, each contributing 10%\n   - Region B: 30 industries, each contributing 8%\n   - Region C: 15 industries, each contributing 12%\n   - Region D: 25 industries, each contributing 6%\n\n2. **Calculate the total contribution percentage of each region:**\n\n   - Region A Contribution: \\(20 \\times 0.1 = 2.0\\)\n   - Region B Contribution: \\(30 \\times 0.08 = 2.4\\)\n   - Region C Contribution: \\(15 \\times 0.12 = 1.8\\)\n   - Region D Contribution: \\(25 \\times 0.06 = 1.5\\)\n\n3. **Calculate the total contribution percentage from all regions:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Contribution} = 2.0 + 2.4 + 1.8 + 1.5 = 7.7\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the GDP contribution of Region C:**\n\n   Using the given GDP of X ($100 billion):\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Region C GDP} = 100,000,000,000 \\times \\left(\\frac{1.8}{7.7}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Region C GDP} \\approx 100,000,000,000 \\times 0.2338 \\approx 23,380,000,000\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the GDP contribution of Region C is approximately $23.38 billion."
