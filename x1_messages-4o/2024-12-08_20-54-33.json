Can I modify the code to handle irregular verbs as well?"

        "content": "To modify your JavaScript code to handle more complex sentences with multiple verbs, including irregular verbs, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Tokenize the Sentence**: Break down the sentence into words and identify the verbs. You can use libraries like `compromise` or `natural` for natural language processing tasks to help identify parts of speech.\n\n2. **Conjugate Verbs to Past Tense**: Create a function to conjugate verbs into their past tense forms. You can use a library like `verb` from `compromise` to handle this, which includes support for irregular verbs.\n\n3. **Reconstruct the Sentence**: Replace the identified verbs with their past tense forms and reconstruct the sentence.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement this:\n\n```javascript\nconst nlp = require('compromise');\n\nfunction convertToPastTense(sentence) {\n  // Parse the sentence using compromise\n  let doc = nlp(sentence);\n\n  // Find all verbs in the sentence\n  let verbs = doc.verbs();\n\n  // Convert each verb to its past tense form\n  verbs.toPastTense();\n\n  // Return the modified sentence\n  return doc.text();\n}\n\n// Example usage\nlet sentence = \"People work in an office, communicate with clients, and complete projects to meet their job requirements.\";\nlet pastTenseSentence = convertToPastTense(sentence);\n\nconsole.log(pastTenseSentence);\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **Tokenization and Analysis**: We use `compromise` to parse the sentence and identify verbs.\n\n- **Conversion to Past Tense**: The `toPastTense()` method from `compromise` handles both regular and irregular verbs, converting them to their past tense forms.\n\n- **Reconstruction**: The `text()` method reconstructs the sentence with the verbs in their past tense.\n\nThis approach should work for most sentences with multiple verbs, including handling irregular verbs. Keep in mind that compromise is a relatively lightweight library, so it might not handle every edge case perfectly. For more complex NLP tasks, you might want to explore more comprehensive NLP libraries or frameworks."
