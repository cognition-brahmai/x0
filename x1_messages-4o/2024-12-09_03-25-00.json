When I run the command 'pledge.Amount.plot()', it returns an object '<matplotlib.axes.AxesSubplot at 0x9397c6c>' but it doesn't display the actual graph. I have already imported the matplotlib library so that doesn't seem to be the issue. Is there any other module I need to import to display the graph?"

        "content": "It sounds like you're encountering an issue where the plot isn't being displayed in your Jupyter Notebook. This is a common issue and is usually resolved by ensuring that the plots are set to display inline. You can do this by using the `%matplotlib inline` magic command. This command should be placed at the beginning of your notebook, preferably in the first cell after your imports. Here's a quick example of how to set it up:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Ensure plots are displayed inline in the notebook\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# Example DataFrame and plotting\ndata = {'Amount': [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]}\npledge = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Plotting\npledge.Amount.plot()\nplt.show()  # This can also help to explicitly display the plot\n```\n\nIf you are still having issues, make sure that your Jupyter Notebook is up to date and that there are no errors in your dataset or plotting code. Additionally, you can try explicitly calling `plt.show()` after your plot command to ensure the plot is rendered."
