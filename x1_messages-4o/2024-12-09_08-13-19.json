The changes could include elements that were added, removed, or changed. The challenge is that the values in these dictionaries can be of varying types such as integers, strings, lists, or other dictionaries, hence the solution needs to be recursive. I have written a function to do this, but it does not work correctly when the value is a list. How can I modify this function to handle lists without having to repeat a large portion of the function after a `if(type(d2) == list)` check?\n\nHere is the function I have so far:\n```python\ndef dd(d1, d2, ctx=\"\"):\n    print \"Changes in \" + ctx\n    for k in d1:\n        if k not in d2:\n            print k + \" removed from d2\"\n    for k in d2:\n        if k not in d1:\n            print k + \" added in d2\"\n            continue\n        if d2[k] != d1[k]:\n            if type(d2[k]) not in (dict, list):\n                print k + \" changed in d2 to \" + str(d2[k])\n            else:\n                if type(d1[k]) != type(d2[k]):\n                    print k + \" changed to \" + str(d2[k])\n                    continue\n                else:\n                    if type(d2[k]) == dict:\n                        dd(d1[k], d2[k], k)\n                        continue\n    print \"Done with changes in \" + ctx\n    return\n```"

When it encounters a list, it calls `compare_lists`.\n- **List Comparison**: The `compare_lists` function compares two lists element by element. If the elements are dictionaries or lists themselves, it recursively compares them using `dd` or `compare_lists` respectively.\n- **Handling Context**: The `ctx` parameter is used to keep track of the path to the current element, providing a clear output of where changes occurred.\n- **Additions and Deletions**: After element-wise comparison, the function checks for any additional elements in either list and outputs them as added or removed.\n\nThis approach should effectively handle changes between two dictionaries with nested dictionaries and lists."
