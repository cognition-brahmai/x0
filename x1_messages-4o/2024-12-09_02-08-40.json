For instance, I have a code snippet like this:\n\n```python\nb = 'some variable'\na = c | b #try statement goes here\n```\n\nIn the above code, `b` is a declared variable and `c` is not, which would throw an error. Is there a way to implement a try/except such that `a` would become `b`, in case of any exception?"

        "content": "Yes, you can implement a try/except block in a single line using a conditional expression. Here\u2019s how you can handle this situation:\n\n```python\nb = 'some variable'\na = (c | b) if 'c' in locals() else b\n```\n\nHowever, since using `locals()` might not always be the most straightforward approach, especially when dealing with undefined variables, you can use a try/except expression using Python's `or` operator, which works as a short-circuit evaluation:\n\n```python\nb = 'some variable'\na = (c | b) if 'c' in locals() else b\n```\n\nIf you want to explicitly catch an exception, you can use a lambda function and a try/except inside it:\n\n```python\nb = 'some variable'\na = (lambda: (c | b))() if 'c' in locals() else b\n```\n\nThis way, if `c` is not defined, `a` will be assigned the value of `b`."
