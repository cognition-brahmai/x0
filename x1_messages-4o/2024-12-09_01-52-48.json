I'm using the same preprocessing code from Keras and I convert to RGB with OpenCV because this is the format expected by preprocess_input(). However, I'm getting slightly different predictions between OpenCV and Keras image loading. I don't understand why the predictions are not the same. How can I use OpenCV imread() and resize() to get the same prediction as Keras image loading?\n\nHere is my code:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport json\nfrom tensorflow.keras.applications.resnet50 import ResNet50\nfrom tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image\nfrom tensorflow.keras.applications.resnet50 import preprocess_input, decode_predictions\nimport cv2\n\nmodel = ResNet50(weights='imagenet')\n\nimg_path = '/home/me/squirrel.jpg'\n\n# Keras prediction\nimg = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))\nx = image.img_to_array(img)\nx = np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)\nx = preprocess_input(x)\npreds = model.predict(x)\nprint('Predicted Keras:', decode_predictions(preds, top=3)[0])\n\n# OpenCV prediction\nimgcv = cv2.imread(img_path)\ndim = (224, 224)\nimgcv_resized = cv2.resize(imgcv, dim, interpolation=cv2.INTER_LINEAR)\nx = cv2.cvtColor(imgcv_resized , cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)\nx = np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)\nx = preprocess_input(x)\npreds = model.predict(x)\nprint('Predicted OpenCV:', decode_predictions(preds, top=3)[0])\n\n#Predicted Keras: [('n02490219', 'marmoset', 0.28250763), ('n02356798', 'fox_squirrel', 0.25657368), ('n02494079', 'squirrel_monkey', 0.19992349)]\n#Predicted OpenCV: [('n02356798', 'fox_squirrel', 0.5161952), ('n02490219', 'marmoset', 0.21953616), ('n02494079', 'squirrel_monkey', 0.1160824)]\n```"

        "content": "The discrepancy in predictions between using Keras and OpenCV for image preprocessing typically arises from differences in how the images are loaded and processed. Here are some steps to ensure both methods produce the same result:\n\n1. **Image Loading and Color Format**: Ensure that the image loaded using OpenCV is in the RGB format since OpenCV loads images in BGR format by default.\n\n2. **Image Size and Aspect Ratio**: Ensure that both Keras and OpenCV are resizing the image in exactly the same way. This includes ensuring that the interpolation method is consistent.\n\n3. **Image Data Type and Values**: Ensure that the data type and normalization of pixel values are consistent between the two methods.\n\nHere\u2019s a refined version of your OpenCV code to match the Keras preprocessing as closely as possible:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport json\nfrom tensorflow.keras.applications.resnet50 import ResNet50\nfrom tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image\nfrom tensorflow.keras.applications.resnet50 import preprocess_input, decode_predictions\nimport cv2\n\nmodel = ResNet50(weights='imagenet')\n\nimg_path = '/home/me/squirrel.jpg'\n\n# Keras prediction\nimg = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))\nx = image.img_to_array(img)\nx = np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)\nx = preprocess_input(x)\npreds = model.predict(x)\nprint('Predicted Keras:', decode_predictions(preds, top=3)[0])\n\n# OpenCV prediction\nimgcv = cv2.imread(img_path)\nimgcv = cv2.cvtColor(imgcv, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)  # Convert BGR to RGB\nimgcv_resized = cv2.resize(imgcv, (224, 224), interpolation=cv2.INTER_LINEAR)  # Resize to 224x224\nx = np.array(imgcv_resized, dtype=np.float32)  # Ensure float32 data type\nx = np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)\nx = preprocess_input(x)\npreds = model.predict(x)\nprint('Predicted OpenCV:', decode_predictions(preds, top=3)[0])\n```\n\n**Additional Tips**:\n- Ensure that the `preprocess_input()` function is applied to both methods after resizing and converting the image to the required data type.\n- Check if any additional preprocessing steps like subtracting the mean or scaling are applied in the Keras method and ensure the same is done with OpenCV.\n- Make sure the image path is correct and the same image is being used in both cases.\n- If there are still minor differences, they may be due to numerical precision differences in the libraries."
