I have tried using the following code:\n\n```python\n'.'.join(urlparse.urlparse(url).netloc.split('.')[-2:])\n```\n\nThis works for URLs like \"http://www.foo.com\", but not for URLs like \"http://www.foo.com.au\". Is there a proper way to do this without using special knowledge about valid TLDs or country codes as they change over time?"

To handle this properly without manually maintaining a list of TLDs, you can use the `tldextract` library, which is specifically designed to handle this kind of task. Here's how you can use it:\n\n1. First, install the `tldextract` library if you haven't already:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install tldextract\n   ```\n\n2. Use the library to extract the TLD:\n\n   ```python\n   import tldextract\n\n   url = \"http://www.foo.com.au\"\n   extracted = tldextract.extract(url)\n   tld = extracted.registered_domain\n\n   print(tld)  # Outputs: foo.com.au\n   ```\n\nThe `tldextract` library maintains an up-to-date list of TLDs, including ccTLDs and other variations, and allows you to extract the registered domain accurately without having to manually manage a list of TLDs yourself. This approach ensures that your code remains robust and adaptable to changes in TLDs over time."
