I am currently computing the force between particles by looping over the positions of these particles, which is quite slow. Given a vector `x[i]`, I want to compute `n[i] = sum from j = 0 to n-1, j != i of (x[i]-x[j])^-2,` using numpy functions instead of looping. Is there a way to perform outer addition/multiplication in python? I am looking to perform operations like `m[i,j] = x[i]-x[j]` and `m[i,j] = x[i]*x[j]`."

Here's how you can achieve the computation you're looking for:\n\n### Step-by-step Explanation\n\n1. **Difference Matrix**: To compute \\( m[i, j] = x[i] - x[j] \\), you can use broadcasting in NumPy.\n\n2. **Avoiding Diagonal Elements**: Since you want to exclude the terms where \\( i = j \\), you'll need to handle the diagonal elements separately.\n\n3. **Summation**: Finally, sum over the axis to get the desired result.\n\nHere's a sample implementation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Sample input vector\nx = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\n\n# Step 1: Compute the difference matrix\ndifference_matrix = x[:, np.newaxis] - x[np.newaxis, :]\n\n# Step 2: Compute the inverse square of the differences, avoiding division by zero\n# Set the diagonal to infinity to avoid division by zero\nnp.fill_diagonal(difference_matrix, np.inf)\n\n# Compute the inverse square\ninverse_square_matrix = 1.0 / np.square(difference_matrix)\n\n# Step 3: Sum over the required axis\nn = np.sum(inverse_square_matrix, axis=1)\n\nprint(n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n- **`x[:, np.newaxis] - x[np.newaxis, :]`**: This uses broadcasting to create a matrix where each element \\( m[i, j] \\) is the difference \\( x[i] - x[j] \\).\n\n- **`np.fill_diagonal(difference_matrix, np.inf)`**: This sets the diagonal of the difference matrix to infinity to avoid division by zero when calculating the inverse square.\n\n- **`1.0 / np.square(difference_matrix)`**: This calculates the inverse square of each element in the matrix.\n\n- **`np.sum(inverse_square_matrix, axis=1)`**: This sums each row, effectively computing \\( n[i] = \\sum_{j=0, j \\neq i}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{(x[i] - x[j])^2} \\).\n\nThis approach leverages NumPy's vectorized operations which are highly optimized for performance, thus avoiding explicit loops and making the computation faster and more efficient."
