How can I use a formula to determine the number of days in August 2021?\n\nAssuming your excel sheet has a column named \"Dates\" with dates including August 2021, you can use the following formula to determine the number of days in August 2021:\n=SUMPRODUCT(--(MONTH(Dates)=8),--(YEAR(Dates)=2021),--(DAY(Dates)<>\"\"))\nThis formula uses the SUMPRODUCT function along with logical operators to count the number of dates that fall within the month of August 2021. The \"--\" is used to convert the logical results to numeric values that can be summed by the SUMPRODUCT function."

The `--` operator converts the logical TRUE/FALSE results to 1s and 0s.\n4. `SUMPRODUCT` sums up these values, effectively counting the number of dates that meet both conditions.\n\nMake sure your \"Dates\" column is correctly formatted as date values for this formula to work properly."
