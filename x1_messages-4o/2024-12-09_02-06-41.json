However, when I run `pip -V`, it still shows pip 1.3.1 from `/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages (python 2.6)` instead of the Python 2.7 version. How can I use the Python 2.7 version of pip located at `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages`?"

        "content": "It sounds like your system's `pip` command is still pointing to the version associated with Python 2.6. To resolve this and use the pip version associated with Python 2.7, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Verify Installation Path:**\n   First, confirm that pip for Python 2.7 is indeed installed in the `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages` directory.\n\n2. **Use the Full Path to pip:**\n   You can directly call the pip installed for Python 2.7 using its full path. Open a terminal and run:\n   ```bash\n   /usr/local/bin/pip2.7 -V\n   ```\n   This should give you the version of pip associated with Python 2.7.\n\n3. **Use Python 2.7 to Run pip:**\n   You can use the Python 2.7 executable to invoke pip, ensuring you're using the correct version:\n   ```bash\n   python2.7 -m pip -V\n   ```\n\n4. **Update Your PATH:**\n   If you frequently need to use pip for Python 2.7, you might want to update your `PATH` environment variable to prioritize the Python 2.7 installation directory. Add the following line to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, or `~/.zshrc` (depending on your shell):\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:$PATH\"\n   ```\n   After adding this line, reload your shell configuration by running `source ~/.bashrc`, `source ~/.bash_profile`, or `source ~/.zshrc`, or restart your terminal.\n\n5. **Alias for Convenience:**\n   Alternatively, you can create an alias for pip2.7 in your shell configuration file:\n   ```bash\n   alias pip2.7='/usr/local/bin/pip2.7'\n   ```\n   Then, use `pip2.7` whenever you need the Python 2.7 version of pip.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to use the pip version associated with your Python 2.7 installation."
