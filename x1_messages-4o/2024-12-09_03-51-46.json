Here is how you can do it:\n\n1. **Locate the IPython configuration file:**\n   If you don't have an IPython configuration file yet, you can create one by running:\n   ```bash\n   ipython profile create\n   ```\n   This will create a default profile directory, typically located at `~/.ipython/profile_default/`.\n\n2. **Edit the configuration file:**\n   Open the configuration file located at `~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py` in your preferred text editor.\n\n3. **Enable vi mode:**\n   Add the following lines to the configuration file to enable vi mode:\n\n   ```python\n   c = get_config()\n   c.TerminalInteractiveShell.editing_mode = 'vi'\n   ```\n\n4. **Save and close the file.**\n\n5. **Restart IPython:**\n   Launch IPython again, and it should now be using vi key bindings.\n\nWith these steps, you should have vi mode enabled in your IPython shell, allowing you to navigate and edit your command line input using vi-style key bindings, similar to what you do in your Bash prompt."
