The training process was successful but I faced an issue when running the script to evaluate an image using the following command:\n\n```python\npython -m scripts.label_image \\\n    --graph=tf_files/retrained_graph.pb  \\\n    --image=tf_files/flower_photos/daisy/21652746_cc379e0eea_m.jpg\n```\n\nThe error message I received is \"The name 'import/input' refers to an Operation not in the graph\". I have done some research and it seems to be related to the selection of the input and output layer. In the script label_image.py, 'input' and 'output' are set as default. The architecture I'm using is 'inception_v3'. Can someone help me resolve this issue?"

        "content": "It sounds like the issue you're encountering is related to the mismatch between the expected input and output node names in the TensorFlow graph and the names specified in your `label_image.py` script. When you retrained the model, the input and output node names might differ from the default ones provided in the script. Here's how you can address this issue:\n\n1. **Inspect the Graph**:\n   First, you need to inspect your retrained graph to identify the correct input and output node names. You can use TensorBoard or a simple script to print out the node names. Here's a quick script to do that:\n\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n\n   def load_graph(model_file):\n       graph = tf.Graph()\n       graph_def = tf.compat.v1.GraphDef()\n\n       with open(model_file, \"rb\") as f:\n           graph_def.ParseFromString(f.read())\n       with graph.as_default():\n           tf.import_graph_def(graph_def)\n       return graph\n\n   graph = load_graph(\"tf_files/retrained_graph.pb\")\n\n   for op in graph.get_operations():\n       print(op.name)\n   ```\n\n   Run this script to list all operations, and look for input and output nodes. Typically for Inception V3, the input node might be something like `input` or `input_1`, and the output might be `InceptionV3/Predictions/Reshape_1`.\n\n2. **Update the Script**:\n   Once you have identified the correct node names, update the `label_image.py` script to use these node names. You will likely find lines that set default values for input and output tensor names. Update them accordingly. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   input_layer = \"input\"  # Replace with the correct input node name\n   output_layer = \"InceptionV3/Predictions/Reshape_1\"  # Replace with the correct output node name\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify Input Size**:\n   Make sure that the input image size is compatible with the model's expected input size. Inception V3 typically expects images of size 299x299. You can resize your image before feeding it to the model.\n\n4. **Re-run the Script**:\n   After making the necessary changes, try running the `label_image.py` script again with the corrected input and output node names.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully evaluate your image using the retrained model. If you encounter any further issues, feel free to ask for more help!"
