If it's possible, where exactly should I position the doctests - in the class' docstring or the constructor's docstring? For instance, I'm attempting to implement something similar to the following:\n\n```python\nclass Test:\n    \"\"\"\n    >>> a=Test(5)\n    >>> a.multiply_by_2()\n    10\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, number):\n        self._number=number\n\n    def multiply_by_2(self):\n        return self._number*2\n```"

        "content": "Yes, you can definitely use Python's `doctest` module for testing classes, and it's quite flexible in terms of where you can place the doctests. In your example, you have placed the doctest in the class's docstring, which is perfectly valid. `doctest` will search for tests in all docstrings, including those of modules, classes, and functions.\n\nHere's how you can use `doctest` with a class:\n\n1. **Class Docstring**: You can place your doctests in the class's docstring. This is useful when you want to provide examples of how to use the class itself, including its methods.\n\n2. **Method Docstring**: You can also place doctests in the docstrings of individual methods. This is useful for demonstrating the expected behavior of each method.\n\nHere's an example using both approaches:\n\n```python\nclass Test:\n    \"\"\"\n    Class to demonstrate doctests with classes.\n\n    Example:\n    >>> a = Test(5)\n    >>> a.multiply_by_2()\n    10\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, number):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize the Test class with a number.\n\n        Example:\n        >>> t = Test(10)\n        >>> t._number\n        10\n        \"\"\"\n        self._number = number\n\n    def multiply_by_2(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Multiplies the stored number by 2.\n\n        Example:\n        >>> t = Test(3)\n        >>> t.multiply_by_2()\n        6\n        \"\"\"\n        return self._number * 2\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import doctest\n    doctest.testmod()\n```\n\nWith this setup:\n\n- The class docstring provides an example of how the class is used overall.\n- The `__init__` method docstring shows how the class is initialized.\n- The `multiply_by_2` method docstring shows how that particular method behaves.\n\nTo run the doctests, you can execute the module. The `doctest.testmod()` function will automatically find and run all the tests in the docstrings.\n\nThis approach can help you document your code effectively while also ensuring that the examples you provide are tested automatically."
