        "content": "To merge two lists in Python such that their elements alternate, you can use a combination of list comprehension and the `zip` function. Here is how you can achieve that with your lists `a` and `b`:\n\n```python\na = [1, 2]\nb = ['a', 'b']\n\n# Use zip to pair elements together and list comprehension to flatten them into a single list\nc = [item for pair in zip(a, b) for item in pair]\n\nprint(c)\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n\n```\n[1, 'a', 2, 'b']\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `zip(a, b)` pairs elements of `a` and `b` together, creating an iterator of tuples: `[(1, 'a'), (2, 'b')]`.\n- The list comprehension `[item for pair in zip(a, b) for item in pair]` iterates over each tuple in the zipped object and then iterates over each item in those tuples to flatten them into a single list."
