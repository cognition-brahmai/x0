I have decided to try using SublimeREPL, but I am having difficulty figuring out how to run Python code with it. Can I run the code on SublimeREPL in the same way I do with the Sublime Text console using CTRL+b? I would appreciate any assistance on this matter."

        "content": "Running Python scripts that require user input can be tricky in Sublime Text 2's default build system, as it doesn't handle interactive inputs well. However, SublimeREPL is a great tool for running such scripts. Here\u2019s how you can set it up and use it:\n\n### Setting Up SublimeREPL\n\n1. **Install Package Control**: If you haven't already, install Package Control for Sublime Text, which will make it easy to install plugins like SublimeREPL.\n\n2. **Install SublimeREPL**:\n   - Open the Command Palette by pressing `CTRL+SHIFT+P` (Windows/Linux) or `CMD+SHIFT+P` (macOS).\n   - Type `Install Package` and select `Package Control: Install Package`.\n   - Search for `SublimeREPL` and install it.\n\n### Running Python Code with SublimeREPL\n\n1. **Open SublimeREPL**:\n   - Go to `Tools` > `SublimeREPL` > `Python` > `Python - RUN current file`.\n\n2. **Key Binding for SublimeREPL**:\n   - You can create a custom key binding to run the current file in SublimeREPL. To do this, go to `Preferences` > `Key Bindings`, and add a new key binding in the user settings file:\n\n     ```json\n     [\n       { \"keys\": [\"ctrl+shift+r\"], \"command\": \"repl_open\", \"args\": {\n         \"type\": \"subprocess\",\n         \"encoding\": \"utf8\",\n         \"cmd\": [\"python\", \"-u\", \"$file\"],\n         \"cwd\": \"$file_path\",\n         \"syntax\": \"Packages/Python/Python.tmLanguage\",\n         \"external_id\": \"python\"\n       } }\n     ]\n     ```\n\n   - This binds `CTRL+SHIFT+R` to run the current file using SublimeREPL. You can change the key combination if it conflicts with other shortcuts.\n\n3. **Run Your Script**:\n   - Save your Python script, then use the key binding `CTRL+SHIFT+R` to run it in SublimeREPL. This should allow you to provide input when prompted.\n\n### Note\n\n- Make sure that your Python interpreter is correctly set up in your system path, so SublimeREPL can locate it.\n- If you're using virtual environments, you might need to adjust the `cmd` in the key binding to point to the Python interpreter in your virtual environment.\n\nBy using SublimeREPL, you should be able to handle scripts that require user input without errors."
