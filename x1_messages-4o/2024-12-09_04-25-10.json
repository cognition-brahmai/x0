I'm unsure why this is happening as I've checked the OpenCV Docs. Could someone help me understand why I'm getting this error? Here's the code I'm running:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport cv2\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nimg1 = cv2.imread('box.png',0)          # queryImage\nimg2 = cv2.imread('box_in_scene.png',0) # trainImage\n\n# Initiate SIFT detector\norb = cv2.ORB()\n\n# find the keypoints and descriptors with SIFT\nkp1, des1 = orb.detectAndCompute(img1,None)\nkp2, des2 = orb.detectAndCompute(img2,None)\n\n# create BFMatcher object\nbf = cv2.BFMatcher(cv2.NORM_HAMMING, crossCheck=True)\n\n# Match descriptors.\nmatches = bf.match(des1,des2)\n\n# Draw first 10 matches.\nimg3 = cv2.drawMatches(img1,kp1,img2,kp2,matches[:10], flags=2)\n\nplt.imshow(img3),plt.show()\n```\n\nAnd here's the error I'm getting:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"match.py\", line 22, in <module>\nimg3 = cv2.drawMatches(img1,kp1,img2,kp2,matches[:10], flags=2)\nAttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'drawMatches'\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering indicates that the `drawMatches` function is not recognized in your OpenCV version. This could be due to a few reasons:\n\n1. **Incorrect Function Call**: The `cv2.drawMatches` function might not be directly available in the OpenCV version you're using. Instead, you might have to use `cv2.drawMatchesKnn`, which is a similar function used for drawing matches. However, since you're using BFMatcher with `crossCheck=True`, you should indeed be using `drawMatches`.\n\n2. **Check OpenCV Version**: Ensure that you have an appropriate version of OpenCV installed that supports the `drawMatches` function. You can check your OpenCV version with the following command:\n\n   ```python\n   print(cv2.__version__)\n   ```\n\n   Consider upgrading your OpenCV package if it's outdated:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade opencv-python\n   ```\n\n3. **Correct Usage of `drawMatches`**: Make sure to provide all necessary arguments to the `drawMatches` function. In your code, the `matches` slice is correct, but the `flags` parameter should be correctly placed. Here's how you should modify your code:\n\n   ```python\n   img3 = cv2.drawMatches(img1, kp1, img2, kp2, matches[:10], None, flags=cv2.DrawMatchesFlags_NOT_DRAW_SINGLE_POINTS)\n   ```\n\n4. **Alternative Way to Draw Matches**: If `drawMatches` is still unavailable, you can manually implement a function to draw matches using the following code snippet:\n\n   ```python\n   def draw_matches(img1, kp1, img2, kp2, matches):\n       rows1, cols1 = img1.shape\n       rows2, cols2 = img2.shape\n\n       out_img = np.zeros((max(rows1, rows2), cols1 + cols2, 3), dtype='uint8')\n       out_img[:rows1, :cols1] = np.dstack([img1, img1, img1])\n       out_img[:rows2, cols1:] = np.dstack([img2, img2, img2])\n\n       for match in matches:\n           img1_idx = match.queryIdx\n           img2_idx = match.trainIdx\n\n           (x1, y1) = kp1[img1_idx].pt\n           (x2, y2) = kp2[img2_idx].pt\n\n           cv2.circle(out_img, (int(x1), int(y1)), 4, (255, 0, 0), 1)\n           cv2.circle(out_img, (int(x2) + cols1, int(y2)), 4, (255, 0, 0), 1)\n           cv2.line(out_img, (int(x1), int(y1)), (int(x2) + cols1, int(y2)), (0, 255, 0), 1)\n\n       return out_img\n\n   img3 = draw_matches(img1, kp1, img2, kp2, matches[:10])\n   ```\n\nUse this manual implementation if `drawMatches` is not available in your OpenCV version."
