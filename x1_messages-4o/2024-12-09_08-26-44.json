In Python, when I extend a list with an empty list, why does it yield \"None\" instead of the original list? Here's what I have done:\n\n```python\n>>>[2].extend([]) == [2]\nFalse\n\n>>> [2].extend([]) == None\nTrue\n\n$ python --version\nPython 2.5.2\n```\nIntuitively, I would think that `[2].extend([])` should yield `[2]`. Am I misunderstanding something here?"

        "content": "In Python 2.5.2, the `extend()` method modifies the list in place and returns `None`. This behavior is consistent across all versions of Python. When you call `[2].extend([])`, you're extending the list `[2]` with an empty list `[]`, which means the list `[2]` remains unchanged, but the method itself returns `None`. \n\nHere's a breakdown of what happens:\n\n1. `[2].extend([])`: This operation extends the list `[2]` with the elements from the empty list `[]`. The list `[2]` remains the same, but the method call returns `None`.\n\n2. `[2].extend([]) == [2]`: This evaluates to `False` because `[2].extend([])` returns `None`, and `None` is not equal to `[2]`.\n\n3. `[2].extend([]) == None`: This evaluates to `True` because `[2].extend([])` indeed returns `None`.\n\nIf you want to compare the list after extending it, you should separate the operations:\n\n```python\nlst = [2]\nlst.extend([])\nprint(lst == [2])  # This will print True\n```\n\nIn this example, you first extend the list and then compare the modified list to `[2]`, which correctly shows that the list remains `[2]`."
