As instructed in the course, I installed Python, Pycharm, and downloaded the Python extension (made by Microsoft) and the \"Code Runner\" extension on VSCode in order to run Python code. However, when I attempt to run my code, I encounter an error message saying \"Python was not found but can be installed from the Microsoft Store\". The full error message is \"[Running] python -u \"c:\\Users\\Ryan\\Desktop\\Python\\app.py\" Python was not found but can be installed from the Microsoft Store: htttps://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?linkID=2082640\". How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering typically suggests that the Python executable is not in your system's PATH environment variable, which means the system can't find Python to run your code. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Python Installation:**\n   - Make sure you have installed Python on your system. You can verify this by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your command prompt or terminal. If Python is installed, you should see its version number.\n\n2. **Add Python to PATH:**\n   - During the installation of Python, there is an option to \"Add Python to PATH\" which, if not selected, would lead to the error you're seeing. If you missed this step during installation, you can add Python to your PATH manually:\n     1. Open the Start menu and search for \"Environment Variables\".\n     2. Click on \"Edit the system environment variables\".\n     3. In the System Properties window, click on the \"Environment Variables\" button.\n     4. In the Environment Variables window, find the \"Path\" variable in the \"System variables\" section and select it, then click \"Edit\".\n     5. Click \"New\" and add the path to your Python installation (e.g., `C:\\Python39\\` or wherever Python is installed on your system).\n     6. Click \"OK\" to close all dialog boxes.\n\n3. **Verify the Python Path in VSCode:**\n   - Open VSCode and press `Ctrl + Shift + P` to open the Command Palette.\n   - Type \"Python: Select Interpreter\" and select it.\n   - Choose the correct Python interpreter from the list (it should show the path where Python is installed).\n\n4. **Restart VSCode:**\n   - After making changes to the PATH or selecting the correct interpreter, restart Visual Studio Code to ensure all changes take effect.\n\n5. **Reinstall Python (if necessary):**\n   - If the above steps don't work, you might consider reinstalling Python. During the installation, make sure to check the \"Add Python to PATH\" option.\n\nOnce these steps are completed, try running your Python code again in VSCode. This should resolve the issue, and your Python script should execute without errors."
