        "content": "In Python, you can insert an element at the first index of a list using the `list.insert()` method. When you use `list.insert(0, elem)`, it will add the element `elem` at the start of the list, shifting all the existing elements one position to the right. This will not overwrite or modify the content of the first index; instead, it will move all elements to make space for the new element.\n\nHere's a quick example to illustrate:\n\n```python\nmy_list = [2, 3, 4]\nmy_list.insert(0, 1)\nprint(my_list)  # Output will be [1, 2, 3, 4]\n```\n\nAs you can see, the element `1` is inserted at the beginning of the list, and the existing elements are shifted to the right.\n\nThere's no need to create a new list and copy elements. The `insert` method modifies the list in place."
