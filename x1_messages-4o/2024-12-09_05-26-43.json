I've tried using `sys.argv[0]` with the code `path = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(sys.argv[0]))`, but it fails when running from another Python script in a different directory. I also attempted using `__file__` with `path = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))`, but encountered issues with `py2exe` lacking a `__file__` attribute, a missing `__file__` attribute when running from IDLE with `execute()`, and a `NameError` on Mac OS X v10.6 (Snow Leopard). \n\nAdditionally, I've noticed that while executing `python a.py` on Windows, the `sys.argv[0]` and `__file__` variables seem to refer to the same file, `a.py`, in both files `a.py` and `subdir/b.py`. However, the current working directory `os.getcwd()` remains the same (`C:\\zzz`) for both files. Here's the file structure for reference:\n\n```\nC:.\n|   a.py\n\\---subdir\n        b.py\n```\n\nI'm looking for a generic solution that would work in all these scenarios."

Here's a solution that should work across various setups, including when using `py2exe` or running scripts in environments like IDLE:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\n\ndef get_current_file_path():\n    try:\n        # Try using __file__ (most reliable method)\n        path = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))\n    except NameError:\n        # Fallback if __file__ is not available (e.g., in some executables)\n        try:\n            path = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(sys.argv[0]))\n        except Exception:\n            # Attempt to get the current working directory as a last resort\n            path = os.getcwd()\n    return path\n\ncurrent_file_path = get_current_file_path()\nprint(f\"The current file path is: {current_file_path}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`__file__`**: This is generally the most reliable way to get the path of the current executing script. However, it may not be available in some environments, such as frozen applications created with tools like `py2exe`.\n\n2. **`sys.argv[0]`**: This provides the path of the script used to start the Python interpreter. It is useful if `__file__` is not available, but it can have limitations when dealing with imported modules or when the script is invoked from a different directory.\n\n3. **`os.getcwd()`**: This gets the current working directory. It's a last resort because it may not actually point to the directory of the script, but it can be useful if both `__file__` and `sys.argv[0]` are unavailable.\n\nThis method should provide a working solution across different platforms and execution environments."
