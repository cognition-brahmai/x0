        "content": "To manage a collection of books in Swift, you can create a class to represent the library and another class to represent a book. The library class can handle adding and removing books. Here's a simple example to get you started:\n\n```swift\n// Define a Book class\nclass Book {\n    var title: String\n    var author: String\n    var isbn: String\n    \n    init(title: String, author: String, isbn: String) {\n        self.title = title\n        self.author = author\n        self.isbn = isbn\n    }\n}\n\n// Define a Library class\nclass Library {\n    private var books: [Book] = []\n    \n    // Method to add a book to the library\n    func addBook(_ book: Book) {\n        books.append(book)\n        print(\"Added book: \\(book.title) by \\(book.author)\")\n    }\n    \n    // Method to remove a book from the library by ISBN\n    func removeBook(byISBN isbn: String) -> Bool {\n        if let index = books.firstIndex(where: { $0.isbn == isbn }) {\n            books.remove(at: index)\n            print(\"Removed book with ISBN: \\(isbn)\")\n            return true\n        } else {\n            print(\"Book with ISBN: \\(isbn) not found\")\n            return false\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Method to list all books in the library\n    func listBooks() {\n        print(\"Listing all books in the library:\")\n        for book in books {\n            print(\"- \\(book.title) by \\(book.author) (ISBN: \\(book.isbn))\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage\nlet library = Library()\nlet book1 = Book(title: \"1984\", author: \"George Orwell\", isbn: \"1234567890\")\nlet book2 = Book(title: \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", author: \"Harper Lee\", isbn: \"0987654321\")\n\nlibrary.addBook(book1)\nlibrary.addBook(book2)\nlibrary.listBooks()\nlibrary.removeBook(byISBN: \"1234567890\")\nlibrary.listBooks()\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Book` class represents a book with a title, author, and ISBN. The `Library` class manages a collection of `Book` objects. It provides methods to add books, remove books by ISBN, and list all books in the library.\n\nYou can extend this basic setup by adding more features, such as searching for books by title or author, or handling duplicates, depending on your project's requirements."
