For example, if I have two strings like `string1 = \"apples\"` and `string2 = \"appleses\"`, the answer should be `\"apples\"`. Similarly, if the strings are `string1 = \"apple pie available\"` and `string2 = \"apple pies\"`, the answer should be `\"apple pie\"`. Can you help me with a simple Python solution for this problem?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can find the longest common substring between two strings using a dynamic programming approach. Here's a Python solution to help you achieve that:\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_substring(string1, string2):\n    # Initialize a matrix to store lengths of longest common suffixes\n    # of substrings. matrix[i][j] will be the length of the longest common\n    # substring of string1[0...i-1] and string2[0...j-1]\n    m = len(string1)\n    n = len(string2)\n    matrix = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n    \n    longest_length = 0\n    end_index = 0  # to store the end index of the longest common substring in string1\n\n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            if string1[i - 1] == string2[j - 1]:\n                matrix[i][j] = matrix[i - 1][j - 1] + 1\n                if matrix[i][j] > longest_length:\n                    longest_length = matrix[i][j]\n                    end_index = i\n            else:\n                matrix[i][j] = 0\n\n    # The longest common substring will be from the end_index - longest_length to end_index\n    return string1[end_index - longest_length: end_index]\n\n# Example usage:\nstring1 = \"apples\"\nstring2 = \"appleses\"\nprint(\"Longest common substring:\", longest_common_substring(string1, string2))\n\nstring1 = \"apple pie available\"\nstring2 = \"apple pies\"\nprint(\"Longest common substring:\", longest_common_substring(string1, string2))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- A matrix is used to store the lengths of the longest common suffixes of substrings.\n- `matrix[i][j]` contains the length of the longest common suffix of `string1[0...i-1]` and `string2[0...j-1]`.\n- If the characters `string1[i-1]` and `string2[j-1]` match, the value is incremented from its diagonal top-left neighbor.\n- The longest common substring length and its end index are tracked.\n- Finally, the substring is extracted from `string1` using the recorded end index and length."
