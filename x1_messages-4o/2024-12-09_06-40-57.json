        "content": "It looks like you're using an older approach to display Plotly charts in Jupyter notebooks. To ensure your Plotly chart displays correctly, make sure you have the latest version of Plotly installed and use the `plotly.express` library, which simplifies the process. Here's how you can modify your code to display the chart:\n\n1. **Ensure Plotly is installed**: Make sure you have Plotly installed in your environment. You can install it using pip if it's not already installed:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install plotly\n   ```\n\n2. **Update your imports**: Use `plotly.express` for easier syntax and update the import for the offline mode:\n\n   ```python\n   import plotly.express as px\n   import plotly.graph_objects as go\n   from plotly.offline import plot, iplot, init_notebook_mode\n\n   init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\n   ```\n\n3. **Modify your plotting code**: Here's an updated version of your code using `plotly.graph_objects`:\n\n   ```python\n   import plotly.graph_objects as go\n\n   colorway = ['#f3cec9', '#e7a4b6', '#cd7eaf', '#a262a9', '#6f4d96', '#3d3b72', '#182844']\n\n   data = [\n       go.Scatter(\n           x=immigration.columns,\n           y=immigration.loc[state],\n           name=state) for state in immigration.index\n   ]\n\n   layout = go.Layout(\n       title='Immigration',\n       yaxis=dict(title='Immigration %'),\n       xaxis=dict(title='Years'),\n       colorway=colorway,\n       font=dict(family='Courier New, monospace', size=18, color='#7f7f7f')\n   )\n\n   fig = go.Figure(data=data, layout=layout)\n   iplot(fig)  # or use plot(fig) if you prefer to open it in a browser\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for Jupyter notebook extensions**: Ensure your Jupyter notebook has the necessary extensions enabled. Sometimes, Plotly's interactive plots require certain Jupyter Notebook extensions to be enabled. You can install them using:\n\n   ```bash\n   jupyter nbextension install --py --sys-prefix plotly\n   jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix plotly\n   ```\n\n5. **Use `import plotly.io as pio` if necessary**: Sometimes, using `pio.show(fig)` might be required instead of `iplot(fig)`:\n\n   ```python\n   import plotly.io as pio\n   pio.show(fig)\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to display Plotly charts in your Jupyter notebook without issues. If you still encounter problems, ensure your notebook and all necessary libraries are up-to-date."
