For example, if I am using a function such as `my_func(0,5,10)`, it should return a list like `[ 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5 ]`. The `Range()` function seems to only deal with integers and my current implementation seems too complicated. My current function is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef my_func(low,up,leng):\n    list = []\n    step = (up - low) / float(leng)\n    for i in range(leng):\n        list.append(low)\n        low = low + step\n    return list\n```\nIs there any simpler Pythonic way to achieve this?"

        "content": "Yes, there is a more Pythonic way to achieve this using the `numpy` library, which provides a convenient function called `linspace`. This function generates evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval. Here's how you can use `numpy.linspace` to achieve what you want:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef my_func(low, up, leng):\n    return np.linspace(low, up, leng, endpoint=False).tolist()\n\n# Example usage\nresult = my_func(0, 5, 10)\nprint(result)  # Output: [0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5]\n```\n\nIn this function:\n- `np.linspace(low, up, leng, endpoint=False)` generates `leng` evenly spaced values from `low` to just before `up`.\n- The `endpoint=False` parameter ensures that `up` is not included in the output, mimicking the behavior of your initial function.\n- `.tolist()` converts the resulting NumPy array to a regular Python list.\n\nThis approach is concise, efficient, and leverages the power of NumPy for numerical operations."
