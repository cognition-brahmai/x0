        "content": "To find the first unique character in a given string using Python, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a dictionary to keep a count of each character in the string.\n2. Iterate over the string and update the count of each character in the dictionary.\n3. Iterate over the string again to find the first character that has a count of 1 in the dictionary.\n\nHere's a sample code that demonstrates this process:\n\n```python\ndef first_unique_character(s):\n    # Create a dictionary to store character counts\n    char_count = {}\n\n    # Count the occurrences of each character in the string\n    for char in s:\n        if char in char_count:\n            char_count[char] += 1\n        else:\n            char_count[char] = 1\n\n    # Find the first unique character\n    for char in s:\n        if char_count[char] == 1:\n            return char\n\n    # If no unique character is found, return None or an appropriate message\n    return None\n\n# Example usage:\nstring = \"swiss\"\nresult = first_unique_character(string)\nif result:\n    print(f\"The first unique character is: {result}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"There is no unique character in the string.\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `first_unique_character` takes a string `s` as input and returns the first unique character, or `None` if there are no unique characters. The example usage demonstrates how to call this function and handle the result."
