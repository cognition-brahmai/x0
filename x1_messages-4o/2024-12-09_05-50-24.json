The Python version is 2.7.6 |Anaconda 1.8.0 (x86_64)| (default, Nov 11 2013, 10:49:09) [GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5493)] on darwin. I am looking to do the following:\n\n1. Launch Spyder without having to go through the Launcher application. I want to be able to launch it by typing things into Spotlight and Quicksilver.\n2. Run Python code from the Finder, either by double-clicking on my .py file or by selecting it and pressing Cmd-O.\n3. Run Python code by typing a Python script's name into Quicksilver as if it was a regular program.\n\nSo far, I have tried associating .py files with /Users/kuzzooroo/anaconda/python.app/Contents/MacOS/python and made them executable (chmod u+x) but the application never launches and I don't receive an error message. I have also attempted to make the files executable and run them from Spotlight, but I encountered the same issue.\n\nCurrently, I can run my code from a Terminal window if I have the right shebang on top and have made the file executable. Moreover, I can generate an application using py2app but it has various drawbacks which I would like to avoid.\n\nOnce I get this working, I would like to control which scripts create a console window when they run and which do not, and control whether the resulting console window disappears when the script completes or waits around for the user (me) to close it. \n\nWhat are the solutions to these issues?"

        "content": "To achieve the functionality you desire, you'll need to perform a few steps to integrate Python scripts and Spyder more seamlessly with macOS's environment. Here's how you can address each of your requirements:\n\n### 1. Launch Spyder Using Spotlight or Quicksilver\n\nTo launch Spyder without using the Anaconda Launcher, you can create a symbolic link or alias that Spotlight and Quicksilver can recognize:\n\n1. **Create an Alias for Spyder:**\n\n   Open Terminal and create an alias for Spyder in a directory that Spotlight indexes, such as `/usr/local/bin`:\n\n   ```bash\n   ln -s /Users/kuzzooroo/anaconda/bin/spyder /usr/local/bin/spyder\n   ```\n\n2. **Ensure Spotlight Indexing:**\n\n   Make sure that the `/usr/local/bin` directory is indexed by Spotlight. You may need to add it to the list of indexed locations in System Preferences > Spotlight.\n\nNow, you should be able to launch Spyder by typing \"Spyder\" in Spotlight or Quicksilver.\n\n### 2. Run Python Code from Finder\n\nTo run Python scripts directly from Finder, you'll need to associate `.py` files with Python and ensure they're executable.\n\n1. **Associate .py Files with Python Launcher:**\n\n   - Right-click a `.py` file in Finder.\n   - Select \"Get Info.\"\n   - Under \"Open with,\" select \"Python Launcher\" from the dropdown menu.\n   - Click \"Change All...\" to associate all `.py` files with Python Launcher.\n\n2. **Make Python Scripts Executable:**\n\n   Ensure your Python scripts have the correct shebang (e.g., `#!/usr/bin/env python`) at the top and are executable:\n\n   ```bash\n   chmod +x /path/to/your_script.py\n   ```\n\n### 3. Run Python Scripts via Quicksilver\n\nYou can create a custom action in Quicksilver to run Python scripts:\n\n1. **Create a Custom Action:**\n\n   - Open Quicksilver and go to Preferences > Actions.\n   - Create a new action that runs a command like `/usr/bin/python` with the selected script as an argument.\n\n2. **Use Quicksilver to Run Scripts:**\n\n   Type the name of your Python script in Quicksilver, select it, and trigger the custom action you created.\n\n### Control Console Window Behavior\n\nTo control the console window behavior, you'll need to modify your scripts or use a wrapper script:\n\n1. **Modify Script Behavior:**\n\n   - Use `input(\"Press Enter to exit...\")` at the end of your scripts to keep the window open.\n   - Use `subprocess` to run scripts in a separate terminal if needed.\n\n2. **Wrapper Script:**\n\n   You can create a wrapper script that launches your Python script in a new terminal window and controls whether it stays open:\n\n   ```bash\n   #!/bin/bash\n   osascript -e 'tell application \"Terminal\" to do script \"python /path/to/your_script.py; read -n 1 -s -r -p \\\"Press any key to close...\\\"\"' \n   ```\n\nSave the above script as `.command` and make it executable. Double-clicking this file will open a new Terminal window, run your Python script, and wait for a keypress before closing.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to integrate Python and Spyder more seamlessly into your macOS environment and control the execution of your scripts as desired."
