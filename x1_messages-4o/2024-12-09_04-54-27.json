For example, I have two dates `date1` and `date2` defined as follows:\n\n```python\ndate1 = datetime.strptime(str('2011-08-15 12:00:00'), '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')\ndate2 = datetime.strptime(str('2012-02-15'), '%Y-%m-%d')\n```\n\nWhen I subtract `date1` from `date2`, I get a `datetime.timedelta(183, 43200)`. However, I would like to know the exact number of months between these two dates. In this case it should return `5` and not `6` because of the hour difference."

        "content": "To calculate the exact number of months between two dates in Python, you'll need to consider both the year and month differences, and then adjust for the day and time differences. Here's a way to achieve this using the `dateutil` library, which provides a convenient way to handle date differences:\n\nFirst, make sure you have the `python-dateutil` library installed:\n\n```bash\npip install python-dateutil\n```\n\nThen, you can use the following code to calculate the exact number of months between two dates:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta\n\ndate1 = datetime.strptime('2011-08-15 12:00:00', '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')\ndate2 = datetime.strptime('2012-02-15', '%Y-%m-%d')\n\n# Calculate the difference using relativedelta\ndifference = relativedelta(date2, date1)\n\n# Calculate the total months\ntotal_months = difference.years * 12 + difference.months\n\n# Adjust for day and time\nif date2.day < date1.day or (date2.day == date1.day and date2.time() < date1.time()):\n    total_months -= 1\n\nprint(total_months)\n```\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **`relativedelta`**: This function calculates the difference between two dates in terms of years, months, days, and time.\n2. **Total Months Calculation**: It calculates the total number of months by multiplying the number of years by 12 and adding the remaining months.\n3. **Adjustment**: Finally, it checks if the day and time of `date2` are less than those of `date1`. If they are, it subtracts one month from the total to account for partial months.\n\nThis will give you the exact number of complete months between the two dates, considering the hour difference as well."
