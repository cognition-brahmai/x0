        "content": "To create a function in Python that returns the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to a given non-negative integer, you can use a simple loop to keep multiplying the powers of 2 until you find the appropriate value. Alternatively, you can use bit manipulation or logarithms for a more efficient solution. Below, I'll provide both methods:\n\n### Method 1: Using a Loop\n\n```python\ndef smallest_power_of_2(n):\n    if n < 1:\n        return 1  # The smallest power of 2 for 0 is 1\n    power = 1\n    while power < n:\n        power *= 2\n    return power\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(smallest_power_of_2(6))  # Output: 8\n```\n\n### Method 2: Using Bit Manipulation\n\nThis method uses the fact that the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `n` can be found by manipulating the bits of `n`. This involves shifting bits and is often more efficient.\n\n```python\ndef smallest_power_of_2(n):\n    if n < 1:\n        return 1  # The smallest power of 2 for 0 is 1\n    n -= 1\n    n |= n >> 1\n    n |= n >> 2\n    n |= n >> 4\n    n |= n >> 8\n    n |= n >> 16\n    n += 1\n    return n\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(smallest_power_of_2(6))  # Output: 8\n```\n\n### Method 3: Using Logarithms\n\nThis method uses the `math` module and logarithms to calculate the power of 2.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef smallest_power_of_2(n):\n    if n < 1:\n        return 1  # The smallest power of 2 for 0 is 1\n    return 2**math.ceil(math.log2(n))\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(smallest_power_of_2(6))  # Output: 8\n```\n\nAll methods will correctly return the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to the given integer. Choose the one that best fits your needs or understanding."
