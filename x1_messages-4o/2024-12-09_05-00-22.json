        "content": "I am working on a password recovery functionality in Django, where a new password will be sent to the user's email. The functionality works fine when the inputted email exists in the database. However, I encounter a 'DoesNotExist at /forgotPassword/ UniversityDetails matching query does not exist' error when an email that does not exist in the database is entered. How can I resolve this issue? Here is my code for your reference:\n\n```python\ndef forgotPassword(request):\n    if request.POST:\n        email=request.POST.get(\"email\")\n        user = UniversityDetails.objects.get(email=email)\n        if(not user):\n            print \"No user\"\n            return render_to_response(\"forgotPassword.html\")\n        else:\n            newPassword = user.password\n            send_mail('Password Recovery', 'The password for your site is '+ newPassword, 'rv_nair@gmail.com',\n    ['rv_ks@gmail.com'], fail_silently=False)   \n            return render_to_response(\"passwordRecovery.html\")\n    return render_to_response('forgotPassword.html')\n```\n\nAnd here is the HTML form I am using:\n\n```html\n<form name=\"forgotPassword\" method=\"POST\" id=\"myFormid\" action=\"http://10.1.0.90:8080/forgotPassword/\">\n<div style=\"float:center;width:100%;color:#0000A0\">\n Enter your E-mail ID</label><br/> <input type=\"text\" name=\"email\" size=\"25\" /> \n <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\" />\n </div> \n</form>\n```"

        "content": "To address the `DoesNotExist` error you're encountering when an email that isn't in the database is entered, you can use a `try-except` block to handle the exception gracefully. This approach will allow you to check if the user exists and respond appropriately without causing an error. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nfrom django.shortcuts import render\nfrom django.core.mail import send_mail\nfrom django.http import HttpResponse\nfrom .models import UniversityDetails\n\ndef forgotPassword(request):\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        email = request.POST.get(\"email\")\n        \n        try:\n            user = UniversityDetails.objects.get(email=email)\n            newPassword = user.password\n            send_mail(\n                'Password Recovery',\n                f'The password for your site is {newPassword}',\n                'rv_nair@gmail.com',\n                [email],  # Use the user's actual email\n                fail_silently=False\n            )\n            return render(request, \"passwordRecovery.html\", {\"message\": \"Password has been sent to your email address.\"})\n        \n        except UniversityDetails.DoesNotExist:\n            # Handle the case where the email does not exist in the database\n            return render(request, \"forgotPassword.html\", {\"error\": \"This email does not exist in our records.\"})\n    \n    return render(request, 'forgotPassword.html')\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Try-Except Block**: A `try-except` block is used to catch the `DoesNotExist` exception when the email is not found in the database.\n\n2. **Email Notification**: If the email is found, the password is sent to the user's email. Note that I used `email` in the `send_mail` function to send the email to the actual user's email address.\n\n3. **Rendering with Context**: Both success and error messages are rendered with context so users receive feedback on their actions.\n\n4. **HttpResponse**: I replaced `render_to_response` with `render`, which is the recommended way to render templates in Django.\n\nThis way, your application will handle the scenario of a non-existent email gracefully by providing feedback to the user without crashing."
