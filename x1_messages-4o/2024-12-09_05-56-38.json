        "content": "The error you're encountering occurs because the test `[ \"$1\" -gt \"-1\" ]` is trying to evaluate `$1` as an integer, but if `$1` is empty or not a number, it results in an error.\n\nTo check if an input argument exists (i.e., to check if `$1` is set and not empty), you can use a simple string comparison. Here's how you can modify your script:\n\n```bash\nif [ -n \"$1\" ]; then\n  echo \"hi\"\nelse\n  echo \"No argument provided\"\nfi\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-n \"$1\"` checks if the string `$1` is non-empty. If `$1` has been set (i.e., if an argument was passed to the script), the condition will be true, and it will print \"hi\".\n- If no argument is passed, it will print \"No argument provided\".\n\nThis approach avoids the integer expression error by checking for the existence of the argument as a non-empty string rather than trying to evaluate it as a number."
