Your quiz should ask questions about recycling and provide feedback on the user's answers. However, there's a catch - the questions will be in code form, and the user will need to decipher them before answering.\nHere's an example of what your code might look like:\n```ruby\n# Define questions and answers in code form\nquestions = [\n  \"7 + 5\",\n  \"100 / 4\",\n  \"8 * 6\",\n  \"What is the sum of the first 10 prime numbers?\"\n]\nanswers = [\n  \"12\",\n  \"25\",\n  \"48\",\n  \"129\"\n]\n# Ask questions and get user input\nscore = 0\nquestions.each_with_index do |question, index|\n  puts \"Question #{index + 1}:\"\n  puts eval(question) # This line evaluates the code and displays the question\n  user_answer = gets.chomp\n  if user_answer.downcase == answers[index].downcase\n    puts \"Correct!\"\n    score += 1\n  else\n    puts \"Incorrect. The correct answer is: #{answers[index]}\"\n  end\nend\n# Provide feedback on user's score\nputs \"Thanks for taking the recycling quiz! You scored #{score}/#{questions.length}. Remember to recycle and reduce waste to help protect the environment.\"\n```\nTo make the quiz even harder, you could add logic puzzles or riddles as questions. This will require the user to do some reasoning to answer correctly, rather than simply evaluating code. Good luck!"

        "content": "Sure, let's create a recycling-themed quiz with questions in code form that will require some deciphering. We'll incorporate logic puzzles and riddles to make it more challenging. Here's a Ruby script that does just that:\n\n```ruby\n# Define questions and answers in code form\nquestions = [\n  \"Reverse this string and find the material: 'repap' + '?'\",\n  \"What is the result of this operation: 'glass'.reverse[1..2] + 'tle'?\",\n  \"Find the odd one out: [2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10].select(&:even?).to_s\",\n  \"'metal' + ('plastic'[-4..-1]).reverse + ' is a type of?'\"\n]\nanswers = [\n  \"paper\",\n  \"bottle\",\n  \"9\",\n  \"recyclable\"\n]\n\n# Ask questions and get user input\nscore = 0\nquestions.each_with_index do |question, index|\n  puts \"Question #{index + 1}:\"\n  puts eval(question) # This line evaluates the code and displays the question\n  user_answer = gets.chomp\n  if user_answer.downcase == answers[index].downcase\n    puts \"Correct!\"\n    score += 1\n  else\n    puts \"Incorrect. The correct answer is: #{answers[index]}\"\n  end\nend\n\n# Provide feedback on user's score\nputs \"Thanks for taking the recycling quiz! You scored #{score}/#{questions.length}. Remember to recycle and reduce waste to help protect the environment.\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Question 1**: Requires reversing the string `'repap'` to find the recyclable material.\n2. **Question 2**: Uses string manipulation to form the word `'bottle'` from `'glass'` by reversing and slicing.\n3. **Question 3**: Asks the user to identify the odd one out in a list of numbers, focusing on evens.\n4. **Question 4**: Combines parts of two words to form a question about recyclability.\n\nThis quiz involves both string manipulation and logical reasoning, making it a fun and challenging way to test knowledge about recycling!"
