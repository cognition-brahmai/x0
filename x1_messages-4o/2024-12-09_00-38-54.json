I understand it may be looking for dependencies for the `<package>`, but why does it sometimes remove packages after performing this operation? For instance, while trying to install Mayavi, it decided it needed to remove Anaconda Navigator. Also, is there a way to specify that I don't want a package to be removed as it doesn't provide an option to perform only a subset of the suggested operations?"

        "content": "When you run commands like `conda install`, `conda remove`, or `conda update`, the \"Solving environment\" step is an essential part of the process. During this step, Conda is determining the best set of packages to install or update, taking into account the dependencies and compatibility constraints of each package involved. This involves:\n\n1. **Dependency Resolution:** Conda examines the package you want to install or update and identifies all its dependencies. It then checks the compatibility of these dependencies with the packages already installed in your environment.\n\n2. **Version Compatibility:** Conda ensures that the versions of the packages and their dependencies are compatible with one another. This can sometimes require upgrading or downgrading certain packages to meet the version constraints.\n\n3. **Conflict Resolution:** If there are any conflicts, such as incompatible package versions or dependencies that cannot coexist, Conda attempts to resolve them by making adjustments, which can include removing conflicting packages.\n\nThe reason you sometimes see packages being removed, like Anaconda Navigator in your example, is that the new package or version you're trying to install has dependencies that conflict with those of the existing packages. In some cases, the best solution Conda finds is to remove a package that cannot coexist with the new requirements.\n\nTo address the issue of Conda wanting to remove a package you don't want removed, you can try the following strategies:\n\n1. **Use the `--no-update-deps` Flag:** This flag tells Conda not to update dependencies that are already satisfied. This can sometimes prevent unnecessary package removals or updates.\n   ```bash\n   conda install <package> --no-update-deps\n   ```\n\n2. **Manually Manage Dependencies:** You can manually specify the versions of packages you want to keep by pinning them in your `environment.yml` file or by specifying them directly in your install command. For example:\n   ```bash\n   conda install mayavi anaconda-navigator=1.2.3\n   ```\n   Replace `1.2.3` with the version you wish to keep.\n\n3. **Create a New Environment:** If managing dependencies becomes too complex, consider creating a new environment specifically for the package you want to install. This isolates changes and prevents impacting your primary environment.\n   ```bash\n   conda create -n new_env mayavi\n   ```\n\n4. **Review Suggested Changes:** Before proceeding with the installation, carefully review the list of changes Conda proposes. If it suggests removing packages you need, you can abort the operation and try another strategy.\n\nThese methods can help you maintain greater control over your environment and prevent unwanted package removals."
