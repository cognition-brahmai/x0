Currently, I am also removing spaces and periods with the code I have. Here is my code:\n\n```python\ndef onlyascii(char):\n    if ord(char) < 48 or ord(char) > 127: return ''\n    else: return char\n\ndef get_my_string(file_path):\n    f=open(file_path,'r')\n    data=f.read()\n    f.close()\n    filtered_data=filter(onlyascii, data)\n    filtered_data = filtered_data.lower()\n    return filtered_data\n```\n\nHow should I modify the function `onlyascii()` to keep spaces and periods?"

        "content": "To modify the `onlyascii` function to keep spaces and periods, you need to adjust the condition to allow these characters. The ASCII value for a space is 32 and for a period is 46. You can modify the function to include these values in the allowed range. Here's the updated version of your code:\n\n```python\ndef onlyascii(char):\n    if (ord(char) >= 32 and ord(char) <= 127) and (char.isascii() or char in [' ', '.']):\n        return char\n    else:\n        return ''\n\ndef get_my_string(file_path):\n    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:\n        data = f.read()\n    filtered_data = filter(onlyascii, data)\n    filtered_data = ''.join(filtered_data).lower()  # Join the filtered characters into a string\n    return filtered_data\n```\n\n### Changes Made:\n- The `onlyascii` function now checks for characters with ASCII values between 32 and 127 and ensures that spaces and periods are included.\n- Used `char.isascii()` to check if the character is an ASCII character.\n- Updated `get_my_string` to use a `with` statement for file handling, which is a best practice for automatically closing the file.\n- Used `''.join(filtered_data)` to concatenate the filtered characters back into a single string after filtering."
