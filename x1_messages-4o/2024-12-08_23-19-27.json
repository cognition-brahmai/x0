The initial list of cartoons is already provided in Java code format as shown below, and needs to be adjusted to match my requirements:\nList<Cartoon> cartoons = new ArrayList<>();\ncartoons.add(new Cartoon(\"Paw Patrol\", \"G\"));\ncartoons.add(new Cartoon(\"Peppa Pig\", \"G\"));\ncartoons.add(new Cartoon(\"Spongebob Squarepants\", \"PG\"));\ncartoons.add(new Cartoon(\"Adventure Time\", \"PG\"));\ncartoons.add(new Cartoon(\"Gravity Falls\", \"PG\"));\nTo ensure that my desired specifications are met, the code should provide a multi-step filtering process that distinguishes cartoons with the correct age rating, and subsequently, displays only the appropriate cartoons for young children."

        "content": "To achieve the desired filtering process in Java, we can use Java's Stream API, which provides a clean and efficient way to filter and display cartoons based on the specified age rating. For young children aged 4 to 6, we typically consider cartoons with a \"G\" rating to be appropriate.\n\nBelow is the Java code snippet that accomplishes this:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.stream.Collectors;\n\nclass Cartoon {\n    private String name;\n    private String ageRating;\n\n    public Cartoon(String name, String ageRating) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.ageRating = ageRating;\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    public String getAgeRating() {\n        return ageRating;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public String toString() {\n        return name + \" (\" + ageRating + \")\";\n    }\n}\n\npublic class CartoonFilter {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        List<Cartoon> cartoons = new ArrayList<>();\n        cartoons.add(new Cartoon(\"Paw Patrol\", \"G\"));\n        cartoons.add(new Cartoon(\"Peppa Pig\", \"G\"));\n        cartoons.add(new Cartoon(\"Spongebob Squarepants\", \"PG\"));\n        cartoons.add(new Cartoon(\"Adventure Time\", \"PG\"));\n        cartoons.add(new Cartoon(\"Gravity Falls\", \"PG\"));\n\n        List<Cartoon> suitableCartoons = cartoons.stream()\n                .filter(cartoon -> \"G\".equals(cartoon.getAgeRating()))\n                .collect(Collectors.toList());\n\n        System.out.println(\"Cartoons suitable for children aged 4 to 6:\");\n        suitableCartoons.forEach(System.out::println);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Cartoon Class**: The `Cartoon` class is defined with two fields: `name` and `ageRating`. It includes a constructor, getters, and a `toString` method for easy output.\n\n2. **CartoonFilter Class**: This contains the `main` method where the list of cartoons is created and populated.\n\n3. **Filtering with Streams**: \n   - The `stream()` method is called on the list of cartoons.\n   - The `filter()` method is used to filter cartoons with an age rating of \"G\".\n   - `collect(Collectors.toList())` is used to gather the filtered cartoons into a new list.\n\n4. **Displaying Results**: The suitable cartoons are printed to the console using `forEach(System.out::println)` to display only those cartoons that are suitable for children aged 4 to 6.\n\nThis solution efficiently filters and displays the cartoons that meet your specified criteria."
