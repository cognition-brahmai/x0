Let \\( r \\) be the number of red marbles and \\( b \\) be the number of blue marbles.\n2. The total number of marbles is 50, so:\n   \\[\n   r + b = 50\n   \\]\n3. The total point value of the marbles is 375. Since each red marble is worth 5 points and each blue marble is worth 10 points, we have:\n   \\[\n   5r + 10b = 375\n   \\]\n\nNow, we need to solve these equations to find the maximum number of red marbles (\\( r \\)).\n\nFirst, let's solve the first equation for \\( b \\):\n\\[\nb = 50 - r\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( b = 50 - r \\) into the second equation:\n\\[\n5r + 10(50 - r) = 375\n\\]\n\\[\n5r + 500 - 10r = 375\n\\]\n\\[\n-5r + 500 = 375\n\\]\n\\[\n-5r = 375 - 500\n\\]\n\\[\n-5r = -125\n\\]\n\\[\nr = 25\n\\]\n\nIf \\( r = 25 \\), then substituting back to find \\( b \\):\n\\[\nb = 50 - r = 50 - 25 = 25\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of red marbles that can be in the bag is 25."
