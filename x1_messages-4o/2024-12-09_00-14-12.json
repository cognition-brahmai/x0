However, there's a twist - you must use logical reasoning to retrieve the information. The star systems' names and coordinates are encrypted and scattered across multiple databases. You'll need to decode the names and use a mathematical formula to calculate the distance based on their coordinates. Are you up for the challenge? Good luck!"

        "content": "Certainly! Let's break down the task into logical steps to solve this space challenge.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Closest Star Systems\nThe seven closest star systems to the Sun are:\n\n1. **Alpha Centauri (Rigil Kentaurus)**\n2. **Proxima Centauri**\n3. **Barnard's Star**\n4. **Wolf 359**\n5. **Lalande 21185**\n6. **Sirius**\n7. **Luyten 726-8**\n\n### Step 2: Retrieve the Distances\nHere are their approximate distances from the Sun in light years:\n\n1. **Alpha Centauri**: 4.37 light years\n2. **Proxima Centauri**: 4.24 light years\n3. **Barnard's Star**: 5.96 light years\n4. **Wolf 359**: 7.78 light years\n5. **Lalande 21185**: 8.31 light years\n6. **Sirius**: 8.60 light years\n7. **Luyten 726-8**: 8.73 light years\n\n### Step 3: Coordinates of Each Star System\nHere are the approximate coordinates (Right Ascension and Declination) for these stars:\n\n1. **Alpha Centauri**:\n   - Right Ascension: 14h 39m 36s\n   - Declination: -60\u00b0 50\u2032 2\u2033\n\n2. **Proxima Centauri**:\n   - Right Ascension: 14h 29m 43s\n   - Declination: -62\u00b0 40\u2032 46\u2033\n\n3. **Barnard's Star**:\n   - Right Ascension: 17h 57m 48.5s\n   - Declination: +04\u00b0 41\u2032 36\u2033\n\n4. **Wolf 359**:\n   - Right Ascension: 10h 56m 29s\n   - Declination: +07\u00b0 00\u2032 53\u2033\n\n5. **Lalande 21185**:\n   - Right Ascension: 11h 03m 20s\n   - Declination: +35\u00b0 58\u2032 12\u2033\n\n6. **Sirius**:\n   - Right Ascension: 06h 45m 08.9s\n   - Declination: -16\u00b0 42\u2032 58\u2033\n\n7. **Luyten 726-8**:\n   - Right Ascension: 01h 39m 01s\n   - Declination: -17\u00b0 57\u2032 01\u2033\n\n### Conclusion\nBy using logical reasoning and available data, we identified the seven closest star systems to the Sun, their distances in light years, and their celestial coordinates.
