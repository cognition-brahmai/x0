For example, I have this class:\n\n```python\nclass My_Context(object):\n    def __init__(self,mode=0):\n        \"\"\"\n        if mode = 0, proceed as normal\n        if mode = 1, do not execute block\n        \"\"\"\n        self.mode=mode\n    def __enter__(self):\n        if self.mode==1:\n            print 'Exiting...'\n            # CODE TO EXIT PREMATURELY\n    def __exit__(self, type, value, traceback):\n        print 'Exiting...'\n\nwith My_Context(mode=1):\n    print 'Executing block of codes...'\n```\nIn this case, if `mode` is 1, I want to prematurely exit the `with` block. How can I accomplish this?"

        "content": "To achieve the functionality you desire, where the execution of the block within the `with` statement is skipped if `mode` is set to 1, you can modify the context manager to return a special object from the `__enter__` method. This object will allow you to conditionally execute the block based on the mode. Here is a modified version of your context manager:\n\n```python\nclass My_Context(object):\n    def __init__(self, mode=0):\n        \"\"\"\n        if mode = 0, proceed as normal\n        if mode = 1, do not execute block\n        \"\"\"\n        self.mode = mode\n        \n    def __enter__(self):\n        if self.mode == 1:\n            print('Exiting...')\n            return False  # Return False to indicate skipping the block\n        return True  # Return True to indicate proceeding with the block\n\n    def __exit__(self, type, value, traceback):\n        print('Exiting...')\n\n# Usage\nwith My_Context(mode=1) as execute_block:\n    if execute_block:\n        print('Executing block of codes...')\n```\n\nIn this setup, the `__enter__` method returns a boolean value indicating whether to execute the block or not. The `with` block checks this value and only executes the block if `execute_block` is `True`. This way, when `mode` is set to 1, the block is skipped, and the program exits cleanly.\n\nThis approach gives you flexible control over whether the block of code inside the `with` statement should be executed based on the `mode` parameter."
