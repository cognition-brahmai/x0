Even though the Python 3.4 interpreter is located at the desired path `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin/python3.4`, PyCharm does not automatically find it. Furthermore, while the interpreter functions correctly and provides the expected output, code completion related to Python 3.4 is not working. For instance, `print(\"hello world!\")` shows an error in the editor, but the console displays the correct output. Can you please help me solve this issue?"

        "content": "To resolve the \"Invalid Python SDK\" error and associated issues with code completion in PyCharm when using Python 3.4, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Python Installation:**\n   - Ensure that Python 3.4 is correctly installed and operational. You can verify this by running the following command in your terminal:\n     ```bash\n     /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin/python3.4 --version\n     ```\n   - If this returns the correct version, then your Python installation is fine.\n\n2. **Configure PyCharm Interpreter:**\n   - Open PyCharm and navigate to `File > Settings` (or `PyCharm > Preferences` on macOS).\n   - Go to `Project: <Your Project Name> > Python Interpreter`.\n   - Click on the gear icon and select `Add...`.\n   - Manually specify the path to the Python 3.4 interpreter by selecting `System Interpreter` and entering `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin/python3.4`.\n   - Apply the changes and see if PyCharm recognizes the interpreter.\n\n3. **Check for Updates:**\n   - Make sure PyCharm is up-to-date. Sometimes, bugs are fixed in newer versions, so an update might resolve the issue.\n\n4. **Rebuild Indexes:**\n   - Sometimes, issues with code completion can be resolved by rebuilding PyCharm's indexes.\n   - Go to `File > Invalidate Caches / Restart...` and choose `Invalidate and Restart`.\n\n5. **Check Compatibility:**\n   - Python 3.4 is an older version and might not be fully supported in the latest versions of PyCharm. Consider upgrading to a more recent version of Python if possible.\n\n6. **Check Project Interpreter Settings:**\n   - Ensure your project's interpreter settings are correctly configured to use Python 3.4.\n   - Verify that the interpreter paths and libraries are correctly set up in the `Project Structure`.\n\n7. **Virtual Environment:**\n   - Consider creating a virtual environment using Python 3.4 and configure PyCharm to use this virtual environment as the interpreter.\n   - To create a virtual environment, use the following command:\n     ```bash\n     /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin/python3.4 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment\n     ```\n   - Once created, add this virtual environment to PyCharm as described in step 2.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the \"Invalid Python SDK\" error and restore proper code completion functionality in PyCharm with Python 3.4."
