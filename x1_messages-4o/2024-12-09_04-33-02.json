I'm asking because strings are technically sequences of strings of length 1, so they do match the `Sequence[str]`, but providing a string to a function expecting a list of strings usually causes an error. My goal is to annotate a function but the existing signature seems too complex and doesn't account for any custom types that are compatible with lists and tuples. Can I exclude strings from type annotation to make it something similar to the non-existent `And[Sequence[str], Not[str]]`? Here is the function I want to annotate:\n\n```python\nPathType = Union[str, os.PathLike]\ndef escape_cmdline(argv: Union[List[PathType], Tuple[PathType]]) -> str: ...\n```"

        "content": "To create a type hint in Python that matches sequences like lists and tuples but excludes strings, you can use the `collections.abc` module along with `typing` to specify a more general sequence type, and then explicitly exclude strings by using a type guard within your function. However, Python's type hinting system does not natively support direct exclusion of types like `And[Sequence[str], Not[str]]`. \n\nOne approach is to use `Union` to specify the types you want to include and then manually check the type at runtime, raising an error if it's a string:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Union, Sequence, List, Tuple\nimport os\n\nPathType = Union[str, os.PathLike]\n\n# Define a type that includes lists and tuples but excludes strings\nSequencePathType = Union[List[PathType], Tuple[PathType, ...]]\n\ndef escape_cmdline(argv: SequencePathType) -> str:\n    if isinstance(argv, str):\n        raise TypeError(\"Expected a sequence of strings, not a single string.\")\n\n    # Now you can safely assume argv is a sequence.\n    # Implement your function logic here\n    ...\n\n# Example of runtime usage:\ntry:\n    escape_cmdline(\"some_string\")  # This will raise a TypeError\nexcept TypeError as e:\n    print(e)\n```\n\nIn this setup, `SequencePathType` is used to indicate that `argv` should be either a list or a tuple of strings, and a runtime check ensures that a string isn't passed inadvertently. This approach maintains clarity in function annotations and leverages runtime checks to enforce the constraints that type hints alone can't express.\n\nIf you're using a type checker like `mypy`, it will understand the `SequencePathType` as either a list or a tuple, and won't match it to strings, but it won't enforce the exclusion of strings without the runtime check."
