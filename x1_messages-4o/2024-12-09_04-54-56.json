        "content": "The error you're encountering is likely due to compatibility issues between the versions of Keras and TensorFlow you're using. The `AttributeError` suggests that there's a mismatch in the API calls, which often happens when there's an update or a change in the internal structure of the libraries.\n\nHere are a few steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check TensorFlow and Keras Compatibility**:\n   - Ensure that your versions of TensorFlow and Keras are compatible. As of TensorFlow 2.x, Keras is integrated within TensorFlow. You can use `tensorflow.keras` instead of importing Keras separately. If you're using TensorFlow 2.x, you should not need to install Keras separately.\n\n2. **Update Your Libraries**:\n   - Make sure you have the latest versions of TensorFlow and Keras. You can update them using pip:\n     ```bash\n     pip install --upgrade tensorflow\n     ```\n\n3. **Use `tensorflow.keras`:**\n   - Modify your import statements to use `tensorflow.keras` instead:\n     ```python\n     from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\n     from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense\n     ```\n\n4. **Set Random Seed Properly**:\n   - If you are using TensorFlow 2.x, the function to set the random seed has changed. Use:\n     ```python\n     import tensorflow as tf\n     tf.random.set_seed(42)\n     ```\n\n5. **Check for Other Incompatibilities**:\n   - If the error persists, check other parts of your code or other libraries you might be using that could conflict with the TensorFlow/Keras versions.\n\nHere's your updated code with the suggested changes:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense\n\ntf.random.set_seed(42)\n\nhidden_neurons = [64, 128, 256]  # Example list of hidden neurons for illustration\n\nfor hidden_neuron in hidden_neurons:\n    model = Sequential()\n    model.add(Dense(hidden_neuron, input_dim=61, activation='relu'))\n```\n\nTry running this updated code and see if the error is resolved. If you still face issues, consider creating a fresh virtual environment and installing the necessary packages to ensure a clean setup."
