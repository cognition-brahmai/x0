I typically use Anaconda with Jupyter, so I'm trying to connect Visual Studio Code to the Python in my currently activated 3.6 virtual environment. I've attempted to install ptvsd in my virtual environment using pip, but this doesn't seem to resolve the issue. I've included screenshots for reference. Could anyone suggest a solution to this problem?"

        "content": "Certainly! Let's go through troubleshooting steps to help you connect Visual Studio Code to the debugger using your Python 3.6 virtual environment.\n\n1. **Ensure Environment Activation**:\n   - Before launching Visual Studio Code, ensure your Anaconda environment is activated. You can do this using the terminal:\n     ```bash\n     conda activate your_env_name\n     ```\n   - Then launch Visual Studio Code from the same terminal:\n     ```bash\n     code .\n     ```\n\n2. **Select the Correct Interpreter**:\n   - In Visual Studio Code, ensure you have selected the correct Python interpreter for your project. You can do this by opening the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and typing `Python: Select Interpreter`. Choose the interpreter that matches your Anaconda environment.\n\n3. **Install Debugpy**:\n   - As of recent updates, `ptvsd` has been replaced by `debugpy`. Make sure you install `debugpy` in your virtual environment:\n     ```bash\n     pip install debugpy\n     ```\n\n4. **Check Launch Configuration**:\n   - Verify your `launch.json` file in the `.vscode` folder is set up correctly. Here is a basic configuration example:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n       \"configurations\": [\n         {\n           \"name\": \"Python: Current File\",\n           \"type\": \"python\",\n           \"request\": \"launch\",\n           \"program\": \"${file}\",\n           \"console\": \"integratedTerminal\"\n         }\n       ]\n     }\n     ```\n\n5. **Install Python Extension**:\n   - Ensure you have the Python extension for Visual Studio Code installed and updated. This extension adds Python language support and debugging capabilities.\n\n6. **Check for Errors in the Terminal**:\n   - Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code (`Ctrl+` or `Cmd+`) and look for any error messages when you try to start the debugger. This might give you insight into what's not working.\n\n7. **Testing the Debugger**:\n   - Create a simple Python script and set a breakpoint by clicking next to a line number. Run the debugger to ensure it stops at the breakpoint.\n\n8. **Update Visual Studio Code & Extensions**:\n   - Make sure both Visual Studio Code and its extensions are up to date, as updates often fix bugs and improve compatibility.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues, the screenshots you mentioned might give more context. Feel free to share specific error messages or logs, and I'll be happy to help further!"
