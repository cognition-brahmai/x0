Here's the code I'm trying:\n\n```python\ndef errors():\n    try:\n        ErrorErrorError\n    finally:\n        return 10\n\nprint errors()\n# prints: 10\n# It should raise: NameError: name 'ErrorErrorError' is not defined\n```\nThe exception disappears when you use `return` inside a `finally` clause. Is this a bug or is it a documented feature? Can someone explain why Python developers allow this behavior?"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is actually documented and intentional, though it can be surprising. In Python, when a `finally` block is present, it is always executed regardless of whether an exception occurs in the `try` block. If there is a `return` statement in the `finally` block, it will override any exception that was raised in the `try` block.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. The `try` block is executed, and if an exception occurs, it is temporarily stored.\n2. The `finally` block is executed immediately afterward.\n3. If there is a `return` statement in the `finally` block, it will cause the function to return immediately, disregarding any exception that was raised.\n\nThis means that the `return` in the `finally` block takes precedence over the exception. When you return a value in the `finally` block, Python effectively forgets about the exception because the function exits due to the return.\n\nThis behavior isn't considered a bug but rather a design decision in Python. The reasoning is that `finally` blocks are meant to be executed for cleanup purposes, and by allowing them to override exceptions, developers have more control over the function's exit behavior. However, it can lead to unexpected results if not handled carefully, so it's generally advised to avoid using `return` statements in `finally` blocks if you want exceptions to propagate as expected."
