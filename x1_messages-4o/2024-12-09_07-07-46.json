While `df['column_name'].map(dict)` works as expected, `df.index.map(dict)` does not and raises a `TypeError: 'dict' object is not callable`. Here's a small example of what I'm trying to do:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'one': {'A': 10, 'B': 20, 'C': 30, 'D': 40, 'E': 50}})\nmap_dict = {'A': 'every', 'B': 'good', 'C': 'boy', 'D': 'does', 'E': 'fine'}\n\ndf['two'] = df.index.map(mapper=map_dict)\n```\n\nThis raises the TypeError. However, if I use a lambda function, it works:\n\n```python\ndf['two'] = df.index.map(mapper=(lambda x: map_dict[x]))\n```\n\nAnd if I reset the index and map on a column, it also works:\n\n```python\ndf.reset_index(inplace=True)\ndf.rename(columns={'index': 'old_ndx'}, inplace=True) #so there's no index name confusion\ndf['two'] = df.old_ndx.map(map_dict)\n```\n\nWhy does the `df.index.map(dict)` not work like the others?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the way the `map()` method is implemented for different types of objects in pandas. Let's break down why `df.index.map(dict)` does not work directly:\n\n1. **Series `map()` Method**: When you use `df['column_name'].map(dict)`, you're utilizing the `map()` method of a pandas Series. This method is designed to accept a dictionary, Series, or a function, and it will map the values according to the provided argument.\n\n2. **Index `map()` Method**: On the other hand, `df.index.map()` operates slightly differently. It is designed primarily to take a function as its argument, not a dictionary directly. This is why you get a `TypeError` when you try to pass a dictionary directly to `df.index.map()`. In this context, the method is attempting to call the dictionary as if it were a function, leading to the error.\n\n3. **Using a Lambda Function**: When you use a lambda function `(lambda x: map_dict[x])`, it works because you're explicitly defining a function that looks up the value in the dictionary, which is compatible with how `df.index.map()` expects its input.\n\n4. **Resetting Index and Using Series `map()`**: When you reset the index and map on the newly created column, you're back to using the Series version of `map()`, which can handle dictionaries directly.\n\nTo map the index using a dictionary without using a lambda, you can convert the index to a Series and then use `map()`:\n\n```python\ndf['two'] = pd.Series(df.index).map(map_dict)\n```\n\nThis effectively takes advantage of the Series `map()` method, which can directly handle dictionary mapping."
