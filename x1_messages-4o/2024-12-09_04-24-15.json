I have a file structure like this:\n\n```\n/<appname>\n    /config\n        __init__.py\n        config.py\n    /test\n        test.py # I'm here\n```\n\nI want to access the functions from `config.py` in the `test.py` file. I tried importing using the statement `import config.config` but when I run the `test.py` script, I receive an error saying `ImportError: No module named config.config`. Did I do something wrong?"

        "content": "To access modules from a different folder in Python, especially when working with a structure like yours, you need to ensure that Python can find the modules you're trying to import. Here are a few steps and strategies to resolve the import issue:\n\n1. **Relative Imports**:\n   If `config` and `test` are both sub-packages of a common package (e.g., `<appname>`), you can use relative imports in `test.py`:\n   ```python\n   from ..config import config\n   ```\n\n   However, relative imports work only when you're running the script as part of a package, not directly. This means you'd need to run your script like a module:\n   ```bash\n   python -m <appname>.test.test\n   ```\n\n2. **Modifying `sys.path`**:\n   You can temporarily modify the `sys.path` in `test.py` to include the path to the `config` directory:\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   import os\n\n   # Get the path to the parent directory and add it to sys.path\n   parent_dir = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..'))\n   sys.path.insert(0, parent_dir)\n\n   from config import config\n   ```\n\n3. **Using Environment Variable**:\n   Set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to include the `<appname>` directory before running your script:\n   ```bash\n   export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/appname\n   python /path/to/appname/test/test.py\n   ```\n\n4. **Project as a Package**:\n   If you plan to distribute your code, consider organizing your code as a package and installing it in a virtual environment. This would allow you to use:\n   ```python\n   from config import config\n   ```\n\n   To do this, create a `setup.py` file in the `<appname>` directory and install it in your environment using:\n   ```bash\n   pip install -e /path/to/appname\n   ```\n\nThese methods should help you successfully import modules from different folders in your Python project. Choose the method that best fits your project setup and requirements."
