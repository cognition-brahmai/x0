In your case, you are using a parameterized query to select the `rowid` from the `components` table where the `name` matches a specific value. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\n\n# Connect to your SQLite database (or create it)\nconnection = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db')\ncursor = connection.cursor()\n\n# The name of the component you are checking\nname = 'your_component_name'\n\n# Execute the query\ncursor.execute(\"SELECT rowid FROM components WHERE name = ?\", (name,))\n\n# Fetch one result\nresult = cursor.fetchone()\n\n# Check if a result was found\nif result is not None:\n    exists = True\nelse:\n    exists = False\n\n# Output the result\nprint(f\"Component exists: {exists}\")\n\n# Don't forget to close the connection\ncursor.close()\nconnection.close()\n```\n\nIn this script, `cursor.fetchone()` is used to fetch the first row of the result set. If a row exists, it returns a tuple containing the `rowid`. If no matching row is found, it returns `None`. By checking if `result` is not `None`, you can determine whether the component exists in the database."
