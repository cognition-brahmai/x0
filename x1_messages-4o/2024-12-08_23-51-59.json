Normally, spilling coffee all over someone's desk, especially the boss's, is not considered a wonderful event. The use of the word \"wonderful\" in this context suggests the speaker is actually expressing dissatisfaction or frustration, rather than genuine admiration or happiness. This contrast between the literal meaning of \"wonderful\" and the situation it describes creates the irony."
