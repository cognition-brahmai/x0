However, it seems like the string is being interpreted as a list with as many arguments as there are characters. Here is my current code:\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\n\ndef write(s):\n   print s\n\nwrite('hello')\n\np = multiprocessing.Process(target=write, args=('hello'))\n\np.start()\n```\n\nWhen I run it, I get the following output:\n\n```shell\nhello\nProcess Process-1:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/multiprocessing/process.py\", line 237, in _bootstrap\n    self.run()\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/multiprocessing/process.py\", line 93, in run\n    self._target(*self._args, **self._kwargs)\nTypeError: write() takes exactly 1 argument (5 given)\n```\n\nWhat am I doing wrong here and how am I supposed to correctly pass a string?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to how the `args` parameter in `multiprocessing.Process` is being interpreted. In Python, when you pass a single string as `args`, it is treated as an iterable of characters, thus causing each character to be passed as a separate argument to the target function.\n\nTo fix this, make sure you provide a tuple with a single element for the `args` parameter. In Python, a single element tuple needs a comma after the element to distinguish it from a regular parenthesis. Here's how you can correct your code:\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\n\ndef write(s):\n    print(s)\n\nwrite('hello')\n\n# Correct the args to be a single-element tuple\np = multiprocessing.Process(target=write, args=('hello',))\n\np.start()\np.join()  # Optionally, wait for the process to finish\n```\n\nBy adding a comma after `'hello'`, you ensure that the `args` parameter is treated as a tuple containing one element, which is your string. This should resolve the error and allow the string to be passed correctly to the `write` function."
