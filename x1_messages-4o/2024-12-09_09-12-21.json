        "content": "Certainly! To design a database table specifically for storing product reviews, you'll need to consider the key elements that are typically included in a product review, such as:\n\n1. **Review ID**: A unique identifier for each review.\n2. **Product ID**: A unique identifier for each product.\n3. **User ID**: A unique identifier for the user who wrote the review.\n4. **Rating**: A numerical rating of the product (e.g., 1 to 5 stars).\n5. **Review Text**: The actual text of the review.\n6. **Review Date**: The date the review was submitted.\n7. **Helpful Votes**: Optional field for tracking how many users found the review helpful.\n\nHere's an example SQL query to create such a table:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE ProductReviews (\n    ReviewID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    ProductID INT NOT NULL,\n    UserID INT NOT NULL,\n    Rating INT CHECK (Rating >= 1 AND Rating <= 5),\n    ReviewText TEXT,\n    ReviewDate DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n    HelpfulVotes INT DEFAULT 0,\n    FOREIGN KEY (ProductID) REFERENCES Products(ProductID),\n    FOREIGN KEY (UserID) REFERENCES Users(UserID)\n);\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- `ReviewID` is set as the primary key with auto-increment to ensure uniqueness.\n- `ProductID` and `UserID` are foreign keys referencing the respective `Products` and `Users` tables.\n- `Rating` is constrained to values between 1 and 5.\n- `ReviewDate` defaults to the current timestamp, capturing the submission time of the review.\n- `HelpfulVotes` is an optional field that can be used to keep track of how many users found the review helpful.\n\nEnsure that the `Products` and `Users` tables exist with appropriate primary keys for the foreign key constraints to work. Adjust the table and column names as necessary to fit your specific database schema."
