However, I encounter a warning message stating \"UserWarning: Could not import the lzma module. Your installed Python is incomplete\". This is happening in my Python 3.7.3 Virtualenv. I have tried reinstalling the GCP bigquery module, but the issue persists. My expectation is that when I write \"from google.cloud import bigquery\" in my Python code, it should not result in any error or warning message. Here is the code I've used and the error message I'm facing:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport logging\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom google.cloud import bigquery\n```\n\nAnd the warning message:\n\n```python\n/home/informatica/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pandas/compat/__init__.py:84: UserWarning: Could not import the lzma module. Your installed Python is incomplete. Attempting to use lzma compression will result in a RuntimeError.\n  warnings.warn(msg)\n exit()\n```\n\nHow can I resolve this issue and import the Google Cloud Bigquery Module without any errors or warnings?"

        "content": "The warning message you're encountering is related to the `lzma` module, which is used for data compression and decompression. This module is part of the Python standard library but requires the `xz` library to be present on your system when Python is built. Here\u2019s how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure `xz` library is installed**: Since you're using a Unix-like system, you need to ensure that the `xz` development package is installed. You can do this using your package manager. For example, on Debian-based systems like Ubuntu, you can run:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install liblzma-dev\n   ```\n\n   On Red Hat-based systems like CentOS, use:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo yum install xz-devel\n   ```\n\n2. **Rebuild Python**: After installing the necessary development library, you'll need to rebuild Python to ensure that the `lzma` module is included. This involves downloading the Python source code, configuring it, and then building it again. Here are the steps:\n\n   ```bash\n   # Download the Python source code\n   wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.3/Python-3.7.3.tgz\n   tar xzf Python-3.7.3.tgz\n   cd Python-3.7.3\n\n   # Configure and build\n   ./configure --enable-optimizations\n   make\n   sudo make altinstall\n   ```\n\n   Ensure you replace any existing symlinks or update your virtual environment to point to the newly built Python if necessary.\n\n3. **Re-create the Virtual Environment**: After rebuilding Python, you should recreate your virtual environment to ensure all the paths are correctly set up:\n\n   ```bash\n   # Deactivate the old environment if active\n   deactivate\n\n   # Remove the old virtual environment\n   rm -rf /path/to/old/virtualenv\n\n   # Create a new virtual environment\n   python3.7 -m venv /path/to/new/virtualenv\n\n   # Activate the new virtual environment\n   source /path/to/new/virtualenv/bin/activate\n\n   # Reinstall your packages\n   pip install google-cloud-bigquery\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify `lzma` Module**: Before proceeding, you can verify that the `lzma` module is correctly installed by trying to import it in a Python shell:\n\n   ```python\n   import lzma\n   ```\n\nIf these steps are followed, the warning about the `lzma` module should be resolved, and you should be able to import the Google Cloud BigQuery module without any issues."
