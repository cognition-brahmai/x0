Even when it led you away from me.\n\n*A CHILD runs past them, chasing after a balloon, symbolizing innocence and the fleeting nature of happiness.*\n\n---\n\n**REBECCA**  \n*(sighs, a mixture of love and pain in her eyes)*  \nLeaving doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t love you.\n\n**JACOB**  \nI know. But staying could mean you do.\n\n*Their eyes lock, a silent communication passing between them. The tension is palpable, yet there\u2019s an undercurrent of mutual understanding.*\n\n---\n\n### **FLASHBACK: A MEMORY OF THEM TOGETHER, LAUGHING UNDER A STARRY SKY.**\n\n*The memory fades back to the present, an emotional anchor to their past.*\n\n---\n\n**REBECCA**  \n*(gently touching the compass)*  \nThis... this will remind me of where my heart belongs.\n\n**JACOB**  \n*(whispering, almost to himself)*  \nI hope it guides you back someday.\n\n*A final boarding call for Rebecca\u2019s flight booms across the terminal, a decisive moment.*\n\n---\n\n**REBECCA**  \n*(tears brimming, but a smile on her lips)*  \nGoodbye, Jacob.\n\n**JACOB**  \n*(with a heavy heart, yet hopeful)*  \nGoodbye, Rebecca.\n\n*Rebecca turns to leave, the compass clutched in her hand.
