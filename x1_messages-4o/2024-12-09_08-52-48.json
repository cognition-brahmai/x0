        "content": "Creating a program to take two numbers as input and output their sum can be done in various programming languages. Here's an example in Python, which is simple and widely used:\n\n```python\n# Function to add two numbers\ndef add_numbers():\n    # Taking input from the user\n    num1 = float(input(\"Enter the first number: \"))\n    num2 = float(input(\"Enter the second number: \"))\n    \n    # Calculating the sum\n    sum_result = num1 + num2\n    \n    # Displaying the result\n    print(f\"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is: {sum_result}\")\n\n# Call the function\nadd_numbers()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Input**: The program uses the `input()` function to take user input. Since inputs are read as strings, we convert them to floats using `float()`, which allows for decimal numbers.\n\n2. **Processing**: The program adds the two numbers using the `+` operator.\n\n3. **Output**: It then prints the result using an f-string for formatted output.\n\n### Running the Program:\n- Simply run this script in a Python environment.\n- Enter the two numbers when prompted.\n- The program will output their sum.\n\nIf you want this in another programming language, feel free to ask!"
