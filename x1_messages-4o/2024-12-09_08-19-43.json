However, I also need to consider filenames with two periods like .tar.gz. Here is the basic code I am working with:\n\n```python\nfilename = '/home/lancaster/Downloads/a.ppt'\nextension = filename.split('/')[-1]\n```\nThis code, however, does not work for files like a.tar.gz. How can I modify this to cater for such instances?"

        "content": "To correctly obtain a file extension in Python, especially for files with multiple extensions like `.tar.gz`, you can use Python's built-in `os.path` module or the `pathlib` module, which are both more robust than manually splitting strings. Here's how you can do it using both methods:\n\n### Using `os.path.splitext()`:\nThe `os.path.splitext()` function only splits off the last extension, so for files like `.tar.gz`, it doesn't directly provide the whole extension. However, you can handle this by iterating until there are no more extensions:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef get_full_extension(filename):\n    base, ext = os.path.splitext(filename)\n    extensions = []\n    while ext:\n        extensions.append(ext)\n        base, ext = os.path.splitext(base)\n    return ''.join(reversed(extensions))\n\nfilename = '/home/lancaster/Downloads/a.tar.gz'\nfull_extension = get_full_extension(filename)\nprint(full_extension)  # Output: .tar.gz\n```\n\n### Using `pathlib` (Python 3.4+):\nThe `pathlib` module simplifies file path manipulations and provides a clean way to handle extensions.\n\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\ndef get_full_extension(filename):\n    path = Path(filename)\n    return ''.join(path.suffixes)\n\nfilename = '/home/lancaster/Downloads/a.tar.gz'\nfull_extension = get_full_extension(filename)\nprint(full_extension)  # Output: .tar.gz\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`os.path.splitext()`**: This function splits the file name into a pair `(root, ext)` such that `root + ext == filename`. By iterating and appending each `ext` to a list, you can handle multiple extensions.\n- **`pathlib.Path.suffixes`**: This property returns a list of all suffixes (extensions) in the file name, making it easy to join them together to get the full extension.\n\nThese methods will help you handle files with multiple extensions correctly."
