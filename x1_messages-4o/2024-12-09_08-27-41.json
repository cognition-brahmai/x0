I have an `OuterClass` with a variable `outer_var` and an `InnerClass` where I am trying to access `outer_var`. However, I'm running into issues. My code is as follows:\n\n```python\nclass OuterClass:\n    outer_var = 1\n    class InnerClass:\n        inner_var = outer_var\n```\nWhen I run this code, I get the following error: `<type 'exceptions.NameError'>: name 'outer_var' is not defined`. I tried accessing `outer_var` using `inner_var = OuterClass.outer_var` but this also results in an error: `<type 'exceptions.NameError'>: name 'OuterClass' is not defined`. How can I access the static `outer_var` from within `InnerClass`?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to how Python handles the scope of class variables, especially in nested classes. When you define a nested class, it doesn't automatically have access to the variables of the enclosing class. \n\nHere\u2019s how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Use a method in the outer class to access the variable:** You can define a method in the `OuterClass` that provides access to `outer_var`, and then call that method from the `InnerClass`.\n\n2. **Access outside the class context:** After the classes are defined, you can access `outer_var` using the outer class's name from an instance or a class method.\n\nHere's an example of how you can structure your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nclass OuterClass:\n    outer_var = 1\n\n    class InnerClass:\n        def __init__(self, outer_instance):\n            self.inner_var = outer_instance.outer_var\n\n# Create an instance of OuterClass\nouter_instance = OuterClass()\n\n# Create an instance of InnerClass, passing the outer_instance\ninner_instance = outer_instance.InnerClass(outer_instance)\n\nprint(inner_instance.inner_var)  # This will print 1\n```\n\nIn this example, when you create an instance of `InnerClass`, you pass the instance of `OuterClass` to it. This way, `InnerClass` can access `outer_var` via the passed instance. This approach respects the scope rules while allowing access to the enclosing class's variables."
