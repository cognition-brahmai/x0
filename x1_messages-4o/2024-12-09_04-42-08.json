My goal is to display \"In the past\" if the date has already passed, and display the exact date if it is in the future. I attempted to achieve this by using the following code:\n\n```python\n{% if listing.date <= now %} \n     In the past \n{% else %} \n     {{ listing.date|date:\"d M Y\" }} \n{% endif %}\n```\n\nHere, \"now\" is intended to represent today's date, but this approach is not working as expected. I am having trouble finding relevant information on this in the Django documentation. How can I correctly implement this comparison?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired date comparison in a Django template, you'll need to ensure that the current date (`now`) is available in the template context. Django's template language does not directly support complex logic or function calls like `now()`, so you need to pass the current date from your view to the template.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n1. **Update your Django view** to pass the current date to the template context:\n\n```python\nfrom django.shortcuts import render\nfrom django.utils import timezone\n\ndef your_view(request):\n    # Assuming 'listing' is provided to the template context\n    context = {\n        'listing': your_listing_object,\n        'now': timezone.now().date(),  # Pass the current date\n    }\n    return render(request, 'your_template.html', context)\n```\n\n2. **Modify your template** to compare the `listing.date` with the `now` variable passed from the view:\n\n```django\n{% if listing.date <= now %}\n    In the past\n{% else %}\n    {{ listing.date|date:\"d M Y\" }}\n{% endif %}\n```\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- Ensure that `listing.date` is a date object, not a datetime object. If it's a datetime, you might need to convert it to a date using `listing.date.date()` in your view.\n- If `listing.date` might be `None` or not set, handle such cases in your view or add a check in your template to avoid errors.\n\nBy following these steps, you will effectively compare the dates and display the appropriate message in your template."
