For instance, given the tensor:\n```python\na = tensor([[1, 2, 0, 0],\n            [3, 4, 0, 0],\n            [0, 0, 5, 6],\n            [0, 0, 7, 8]])\n```\nI want to create a function `extract(a, m, n)` that will produce the following output:\n```python\nextract(a, 2, 2) -> tensor([[1, 2, 5, 6],\n                            [3, 4, 7, 8]])\n```\nI've considered using some sort of slicing, as the blocks can be represented by:\n```python\nfor i in range(m):\n    print(a[i*m: i*m + n, i*m: i*m + n])\n```\nThis yields:\n```python\ntensor([[1, 2],\n        [3, 4]])\ntensor([[5, 6],\n        [7, 8]])\n```\nHow do I proceed from here to solve my problem?"

        "content": "To achieve your desired output, you can iterate over the blocks and concatenate them along the second dimension (columns) to form the resulting tensor. Here's a function `extract` demonstrating how you can do this using PyTorch:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\ndef extract(a, m, n):\n    blocks = []\n    for i in range(m):\n        # Extract each n*n block from the diagonal\n        block = a[i*n:(i+1)*n, i*n:(i+1)*n]\n        # Flatten the block to shape (n, n)\n        blocks.append(block)\n    \n    # Concatenate all blocks along the second dimension\n    result = torch.cat(blocks, dim=1)\n    return result\n\n# Example usage\na = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 0, 0],\n                  [3, 4, 0, 0],\n                  [0, 0, 5, 6],\n                  [0, 0, 7, 8]])\n\noutput = extract(a, 2, 2)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nIn this function:\n- We iterate over each block using `range(m)` where `m` is the number of blocks.\n- For each block, we slice the original tensor `a` to get an `n*n` block.\n- We then append each block to a list and finally concatenate them using `torch.cat` along dimension 1 (columns).\n\nThis will give you the desired tensor with shape `(n, m*n)`, where each block is flattened and concatenated along the columns."
