I want to verify the package generated by `bdist_wheel` to see what it contains. While I understand that tests are there to ensure it works, I want to view the effects of the options I've set."

        "content": "To list the files contained in a Python wheel, you can use the `wheel` package. This package provides a command-line utility to inspect wheel files. Here's how you can list the contents of a `.whl` file:\n\n1. **Install the `wheel` package**: If you haven't already, install it using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install wheel\n   ```\n\n2. **Use the `unpack` command**: You can unpack the wheel into a directory to see its contents. This does not install the package; it just extracts the files for inspection.\n\n   ```bash\n   wheel unpack your_package.whl\n   ```\n\n   This command will create a directory with the same name as the wheel file (minus the `.whl` extension), and you can browse through the files.\n\n3. **Use the `zipfile` module**: Since `.whl` files are essentially ZIP archives, you can also use Python's built-in `zipfile` module to list the contents:\n\n   ```python\n   import zipfile\n\n   with zipfile.ZipFile('your_package.whl', 'r') as whl:\n       whl.printdir()\n   ```\n\n   This will print a list of all the files contained in the wheel.\n\n4. **Manually inspect with a tool**: Since wheel files are ZIP files, you can manually inspect them using any tool that can open ZIP archives, such as `unzip`, `7-Zip`, or even a file explorer on most operating systems.\n\nBy using these methods, you can verify what files are included in your wheel package and ensure that your `setup.py` options are correctly adding the desired non-Python files."
