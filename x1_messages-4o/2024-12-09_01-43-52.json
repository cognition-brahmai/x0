I am interested in calculating the precision, recall, and F-measure for each of these matrices. However, my result logs do not contain `y_true` and `y_pred`, they only contain the confusion matrices. How can I calculate these metrics directly from the confusion matrix?"

        "content": "To calculate precision, recall, and F-measure (F1-score) from a confusion matrix in a multiclass classification problem, you can derive these metrics using the values from the confusion matrix itself. Here is how you can compute them:\n\nAssume you have a confusion matrix for a single class, where:\n- \\( TP \\) (True Positive) is the number of correct predictions for the class.\n- \\( FP \\) (False Positive) is the number of incorrect predictions that the class belongs to.\n- \\( FN \\) (False Negative) is the number of instances that belong to the class but were predicted incorrectly.\n- \\( TN \\) (True Negative) is the number of correct predictions that the class does not belong to.\n\nThe confusion matrix for a specific class can be represented as:\n```\n          Actual\n          P      N\nPred P   TP     FP\nPred N   FN     TN\n```\n\nIn a multiclass confusion matrix, this is how you can calculate the metrics for each class:\n\n1. **Precision** for a class \\( i \\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Precision}_i = \\frac{TP_i}{TP_i + FP_i}\n   \\]\n   where \\( TP_i \\) is the value at the diagonal of the matrix for class \\( i \\), and \\( FP_i \\) is the sum of the column for class \\( i \\) minus \\( TP_i \\).\n\n2. **Recall** for a class \\( i \\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Recall}_i = \\frac{TP_i}{TP_i + FN_i}\n   \\]\n   where \\( FN_i \\) is the sum of the row for class \\( i \\) minus \\( TP_i \\).\n\n3. **F1-Score** for a class \\( i \\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{F1}_i = \\frac{2 \\times \\text{Precision}_i \\times \\text{Recall}_i}{\\text{Precision}_i + \\text{Recall}_i}\n   \\]\n\nTo implement this in Python, you can iterate over each class and compute these metrics. Here's a sample implementation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_metrics(confusion_matrix):\n    num_classes = confusion_matrix.shape[0]\n    precision = np.zeros(num_classes)\n    recall = np.zeros(num_classes)\n    f1_score = np.zeros(num_classes)\n\n    for i in range(num_classes):\n        TP = confusion_matrix[i, i]\n        FP = np.sum(confusion_matrix[:, i]) - TP\n        FN = np.sum(confusion_matrix[i, :]) - TP\n        TN = np.sum(confusion_matrix) - (TP + FP + FN)\n\n        precision[i] = TP / (TP + FP) if TP + FP > 0 else 0\n        recall[i] = TP / (TP + FN) if TP + FN > 0 else 0\n        f1_score[i] = (2 * precision[i] * recall[i]) / (precision[i] + recall[i]) if precision[i] + recall[i] > 0 else 0\n\n    return precision, recall, f1_score\n\n# Example usage\nconfusion_matrix = np.array([[9, 1, 0],\n                             [1, 7, 1],\n                             [0, 2, 6]])\n\nprecision, recall, f1_score = calculate_metrics(confusion_matrix)\n\nprint(\"Precision:\", precision)\nprint(\"Recall:\", recall)\nprint(\"F1 Score:\", f1_score)\n```\n\nThis code will give you the precision, recall, and F1-score for each class based on the confusion matrix provided. Make sure your confusion matrix is in the format where rows represent actual classes and columns represent predicted classes."
