I'm finding this a bit concerning because it seems like a floating point dictionary key can overwrite an integer key with the same value. Is this actually a feature in Python and if so, how can it be useful?"

        "content": "Yes, what you're observing is indeed a feature of Python dictionaries. In Python, both `1` (an integer) and `1.0` (a floating-point number) are considered equal when used as dictionary keys. This is because Python keys are compared using the `==` operator, and `1 == 1.0` evaluates to `True`.\n\nHere's how the code works:\n\n1. `confusion[1] = 1` creates an entry in the dictionary with the key `1` and value `1`.\n2. `confusion['1'] = 2` creates a separate entry with the key `'1'` (a string) and value `2`.\n3. `confusion[1.0] = 4` attempts to create an entry with the key `1.0`, but since `1.0 == 1`, it actually updates the existing entry with the key `1` to the new value `4`.\n\nWhen you iterate over the dictionary and sum the values, you get `4 + 2 = 6`.\n\nThis behavior can be useful for cases where you want to treat numbers that are equal in value but might differ in type (like `int` and `float`) as the same keys. However, you should be cautious when using mutable objects or objects of different types as keys, as it can lead to unexpected behavior if you're not aware of how Python handles key equality.\n\nIf you need to distinguish between different numeric types, you might consider converting them to strings or using tuples to encapsulate both the type and the value."
