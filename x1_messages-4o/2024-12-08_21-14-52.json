Unlike natural selection, which involves survival and reproduction advantages, genetic drift occurs by chance and can lead to unpredictable changes in a population's genetic makeup over time.</p>\n\n    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>\n    <ul>\n        <li><strong>Random Events:</strong> Genetic drift is driven by random sampling effects, especially in small populations.</li>\n        <li><strong>Allele Frequency:</strong> The proportion of different alleles in a population may change randomly over generations.</li>\n        <li><strong>Population Size:</strong> Smaller populations are more susceptible to genetic drift than larger ones.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <div class=\"image\">\n        <img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Genetic_drift_in_a_population_simulation.gif\" alt=\"Genetic Drift Simulation\">\n        <p><em>Figure 1: Simulation of Genetic Drift Over Generations</em></p>\n    </div>\n\n    <h2>Illustrative Example</h2>\n    <div class=\"example\">\n        <p>Consider a small population of rabbits with two allele types for fur color: brown (B) and white (b). Initially, the population has an equal number of each color. By chance, more brown rabbits reproduce in one generation, leading to a higher frequency of the brown allele. Over time, the white allele might even disappear entirely, not because it is less fit, but due to random chance.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <h2>Case Study: The Bottleneck Effect</h2>\n    <p>The bottleneck effect is a specific type of genetic drift that occurs when a population's size is drastically reduced due to a sudden event, such as a natural disaster. This reduction can lead to a loss of genetic diversity and a change in allele frequencies.</p>\n\n    <div class=\"example\">\n        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A severe storm hits an island, reducing a bird population from 1000 to 10 individuals. These 10 survivors may not represent the genetic diversity of the original population. As they reproduce, the genetic makeup of the new population will be different from the original.</p>\n    </div>\n\n    <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n    <p>Genetic drift is a fascinating aspect of evolutionary biology that demonstrates how chance events can shape the genetic structure of populations. While it has a more pronounced effect in small populations, understanding genetic drift helps in comprehending the broader dynamics of evolution.</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis HTML page provides an overview of genetic drift, illustrated with a simple example and a case study.
