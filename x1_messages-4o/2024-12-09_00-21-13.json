However, I receive an ImportError saying 'No module named pytz'. Even though, as far as I can tell, I don't require pytz for my work. The code I'm trying to run is as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom pylab import *\n# read image to array\nim = array(Image.open('empire.jpg')) # plot the image\nimshow(im)\n# some points\nx = [100,100,400,400]\ny = [200,500,200,500]\n# plot the points with red star-markers\nplot(x,y,'r*')\n# line plot connecting the first two points\nplot(x[:2],y[:2])\n# add title and show the plot\ntitle('Plotting: \"empire.jpg\"')\nshow()\n```\n\nWhen trying to run this script, I get the following error:\n\n```python\n  File \"plotch1.py\", line 2, in <module>\n    from pylab import *\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/site-packages/pylab.py\", line 1, in <module>\n    from matplotlib.pylab import *\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/site-packages/matplotlib/pylab.py\", line 208, in <module>\n    from matplotlib import mpl  # pulls in most modules\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/site-packages/matplotlib/mpl.py\", line 4, in <module>\n    from matplotlib import axes\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/site-packages/matplotlib/axes.py\", line 18, in <module>\n    from matplotlib import dates as mdates\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/site-packages/matplotlib/dates.py\", line 82, in <module>\n    import pytz\nImportError: No module named pytz\n```\n\nI've installed matplotlib and numpy from macpython.org and I've installed scipy 0.11.0 all for python 2.5 on my OS X 10.9.4. Do I need pytz for my work and if not, how do I resolve this error?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the `pytz` module being a dependency of `matplotlib`, which in turn is being imported when you use `from pylab import *`. Even if your code doesn't directly use `pytz`, `matplotlib` requires it for handling date and time functionalities.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to install the `pytz` module. Since you're using Python 2.5, you might need to install it manually or use a compatible package manager for older Python versions. Here\u2019s how you can install `pytz`:\n\n1. **Using `pip`**: If you have `pip` installed for Python 2.5, you can run the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pytz\n   ```\n\n2. **Manual Installation**: If `pip` is not available, you can manually download the `pytz` package from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/#files) and install it:\n\n   - Download the `.tar.gz` file for `pytz`.\n   - Extract the contents of the file.\n   - Navigate to the extracted directory in the terminal.\n   - Run the following command to install:\n\n     ```bash\n     python setup.py install\n     ```\n\nOnce `pytz` is installed, try running your script again, and the ImportError should be resolved. Additionally, consider updating your Python environment, if possible, as Python 2.5 is very outdated, and newer versions of Python provide improved features and security updates."
