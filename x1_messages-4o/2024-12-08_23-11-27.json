How can I construct a SQL query to retrieve all articles that contain this topic?\nAssuming the articles are stored in a table named \"articles\" with columns \"id\", \"title\", \"content\", and \"topic\", here's an example query:\nSELECT *\nFROM articles\nWHERE topic LIKE '%persuasive speech%'\nThis will return all articles where the \"topic\" column contains the phrase \"persuasive speech\". Is there a way to further refine this query to only retrieve articles where \"persuasive speech\" is the main topic or a major focus?"

        "content": "To refine your SQL query to retrieve articles where \"persuasive speech\" is the main topic or a major focus, you can enhance the query by considering different approaches. Here are a few strategies you might consider:\n\n1. **Exact Match in Topic Column:**\n   If the \"topic\" column is specifically designed to hold the main topic of each article and typically contains concise descriptors, you might want to search for an exact match or use a more targeted pattern. For example:\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT *\n   FROM articles\n   WHERE topic = 'persuasive speech'\n   ```\n\n   This assumes that the topic column contains a singular, precise topic description.\n\n2. **Keyword Emphasis in Content or Title:**\n   If articles often mention their primary focus in the title or the beginning of the content, you can search for occurrences of \"persuasive speech\" in these parts. For instance:\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT *\n   FROM articles\n   WHERE topic LIKE '%persuasive speech%'\n      OR title LIKE '%persuasive speech%'\n      OR content LIKE '%persuasive speech%' \n   ORDER BY CASE \n      WHEN title LIKE '%persuasive speech%' THEN 1\n      WHEN content LIKE '%persuasive speech%' THEN 2\n      ELSE 3\n   END\n   ```\n\n   This query checks for \"persuasive speech\" in the topic, title, and content, prioritizing results where it appears in the title first, then the content.\n\n3. **Using Full-Text Search:**\n   If your database supports full-text search capabilities (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), you can perform a more sophisticated search to find articles where \"persuasive speech\" is emphasized within the text. Here\u2019s how you might do it in MySQL:\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT *\n   FROM articles\n   WHERE MATCH(topic, title, content) AGAINST ('\"persuasive speech\"' IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE)\n   ```\n\n   This query uses full-text search to find articles where \"persuasive speech\" is a significant phrase, leveraging the database's built-in relevance scoring.\n\n4. **Weighted Search:**\n   If you can assign weights to different columns, you can prioritize articles where \"persuasive speech\" is mentioned prominently. For example:\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT *, \n      (CASE WHEN topic LIKE '%persuasive speech%' THEN 3 ELSE 0 END +\n       CASE WHEN title LIKE '%persuasive speech%' THEN 2 ELSE 0 END +\n       CASE WHEN content LIKE '%persuasive speech%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS relevance_score\n   FROM articles\n   WHERE topic LIKE '%persuasive speech%'\n      OR title LIKE '%persuasive speech%'\n      OR content LIKE '%persuasive speech%'\n   ORDER BY relevance_score DESC\n   ```\n\n   This approach scores articles based on where \"persuasive speech\" is found, prioritizing those with higher scores.\n\nThese strategies aim to refine your search based on how your data is structured and how you define \"main topic\" or \"major focus.\" Adjust the queries based on your specific needs and the database system you are using."
