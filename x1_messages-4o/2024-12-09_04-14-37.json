For example, in the below code, I am testing if the Car object's `__init__` sets its fields correctly. However, if one assertion fails, I can't see all of the errors at once. I have to fix the `model` error, re-run the test and then the `wheel_count` error appears. Is there a way to get `EXPECT_*`-like behavior in Python's `unittest`? If not in `unittest`, then is there another Python unit test framework that supports this behavior?\n```\nclass Car(object):\n  def __init__(self, make, model):\n    self.make = make\n    self.model = make  # Copy and paste error: should be model.\n    self.has_seats = True\n    self.wheel_count = 3  # Typo: should be 4.\n\nclass CarTest(unittest.TestCase):\n  def test_init(self):\n    make = \"Ford\"\n    model = \"Model T\"\n    car = Car(make=make, model=model)\n    self.assertEqual(car.make, make)\n    self.assertEqual(car.model, model)  # Failure!\n    self.assertTrue(car.has_seats)\n    self.assertEqual(car.wheel_count, 4)  # Failure!\n```"

        "content": "In Python's `unittest` framework, assertions will halt the test execution upon failure, meaning you won't see all failures at once. However, you can achieve a similar behavior to the `EXPECT_*` macros in some other testing frameworks or by using additional tools.\n\n### Using `unittest` with `subTest`\n\nOne way to achieve this in `unittest` is by using the `subTest` context manager. This allows you to capture multiple assertion failures within a single test method, and it will report each subtest separately. Here's how you can modify your test case using `subTest`:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\n\nclass Car(object):\n    def __init__(self, make, model):\n        self.make = make\n        self.model = make  # Copy and paste error: should be model.\n        self.has_seats = True\n        self.wheel_count = 3  # Typo: should be 4.\n\nclass CarTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def test_init(self):\n        make = \"Ford\"\n        model = \"Model T\"\n        car = Car(make=make, model=model)\n\n        with self.subTest(attribute='make'):\n            self.assertEqual(car.make, make)\n\n        with self.subTest(attribute='model'):\n            self.assertEqual(car.model, model)\n\n        with self.subTest(attribute='has_seats'):\n            self.assertTrue(car.has_seats)\n\n        with self.subTest(attribute='wheel_count'):\n            self.assertEqual(car.wheel_count, 4)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\n### Using `pytest`\n\nAlternatively, you can use `pytest`, a popular testing framework that supports this behavior more natively with its `assert` statements. `pytest` will continue to execute the test and report all assertion failures after completion. Here\u2019s how you can write the test using `pytest`:\n\n```python\nimport pytest\n\nclass Car(object):\n    def __init__(self, make, model):\n        self.make = make\n        self.model = make  # Copy and paste error: should be model.\n        self.has_seats = True\n        self.wheel_count = 3  # Typo: should be 4.\n\ndef test_car_init():\n    make = \"Ford\"\n    model = \"Model T\"\n    car = Car(make=make, model=model)\n\n    assert car.make == make\n    assert car.model == model\n    assert car.has_seats is True\n    assert car.wheel_count == 4\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    pytest.main()\n```\n\n### Using `pytest-check`\n\nIf you prefer to stay in the `unittest` framework but want `pytest`-like multiple failure reporting, consider using the `pytest-check` plugin, which allows you to continue executing assertions even after a failure:\n\n```python\nimport pytest_check as check\n\nclass Car(object):\n    def __init__(self, make, model):\n        self.make = make\n        self.model = make  # Copy and paste error: should be model.\n        self.has_seats = True\n        self.wheel_count = 3  # Typo: should be 4.\n\ndef test_car_init():\n    make = \"Ford\"\n    model = \"Model T\"\n    car = Car(make=make, model=model)\n\n    check.equal(car.make, make)\n    check.equal(car.model, model)\n    check.is_true(car.has_seats)\n    check.equal(car.wheel_count, 4)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    pytest.main()\n```\n\nEach of these approaches allows you to see multiple assertion failures in a single test run, making it easier to debug and correct multiple issues simultaneously."
