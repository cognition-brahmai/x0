Using only her memory, she needs to recall how many calories she has consumed by 6 PM. If she had her last meal at 3 PM, how many calories should she remember consuming? Hint: Assume she woke up at 7 AM and started tracking her calories then."

Let's break down a potential eating schedule:\n\n1. **Breakfast (around 8 AM):** \n   - She might have had a standard breakfast, such as oatmeal, eggs, toast, or cereal. \n   - Estimated calories: 300-500 calories.\n\n2. **Morning Snack (around 10 AM):**\n   - A light snack like a piece of fruit, yogurt, or a small handful of nuts.\n   - Estimated calories: 100-200 calories.\n\n3. **Lunch (around 12 PM):**\n   - A balanced meal, possibly a sandwich, salad, or a small portion of rice and curry.\n   - Estimated calories: 400-600 calories.\n\n4. **Afternoon Snack (around 2 PM):**\n   - Another small snack, similar to the morning snack.\n   - Estimated calories: 100-200 calories.\n\n5. **Last Meal (at 3 PM):**\n   - This might have been a larger snack or a small meal, like a smoothie or a wrap.\n   - Estimated calories: 200-400 calories.\n\nAdding these estimates together gives a range of potential total calorie consumption:\n\n- Breakfast: 300-500 calories\n- Morning Snack: 100-200 calories\n- Lunch: 400-600 calories\n- Afternoon Snack: 100-200 calories\n- Last Meal: 200-400 calories\n\nTotal estimated calories consumed by 6 PM: 1100 to 1900 calories.\n\nOf course, these are just estimates and can vary based on her specific dietary habits and portion sizes. If she remembers specific meals or portions, she can adjust these numbers accordingly."
