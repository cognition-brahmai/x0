I'm having a problem with the code I've written as it's returning data from the local machine as opposed to the remote one. Here is the code I'm currently using:\n\n```python\nimport wmi\nimport os\nimport subprocess\nimport re\nimport socket, sys\n\ndef main():\n\n     host=\"remotemachine\"\n     username=\"adminaam\"\n     password=\"passpass!\"\n     server =connects(host, username, password)\n     s = socket.socket()\n     s.settimeout(5)\n     print server.run_remote('hostname')\n\nclass connects:\n\n    def __init__(self, host, username, password, s = socket.socket()):\n        self.host=host\n        self.username=username\n        self.password=password\n        self.s=s\n\n        try:\n            self.connection= wmi.WMI(self.host, user=self.username, password=self.password)\n            self.s.connect(('10.10.10.3', 25))\n            print \"Connection established\"\n        except:\n            print \"Could not connect to machine\"\n\n\n   def run_remote(self, cmd, async=False, minimized=True):\n       call=subprocess.check_output(cmd, shell=True,stderr=subprocess.STDOUT )\n       print call\n\nmain() \n```\n\nHow can I modify this code to correctly connect to the remote machine and execute commands there?"

        "content": "To execute commands on a remote Windows machine using Python, you have a few options. The `wmi` module you've started using is typically for managing Windows hosts from a local machine rather than executing shell commands on a remote machine. Instead, you can use `winrm` (Windows Remote Management) or `pywinrm` to execute commands on a remote Windows machine.\n\nHere's an example using `pywinrm`:\n\n1. **Install `pywinrm`**: You need to install the `pywinrm` library. You can do this using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pywinrm\n   ```\n\n2. **Modify your script**: Here is a basic example of how you can use `pywinrm` to execute commands on a remote Windows machine:\n\n   ```python\n   import winrm\n\n   def main():\n       host = 'http://remotemachine:5985/wsman'\n       username = 'adminaam'\n       password = 'passpass!'\n       \n       # Create a session object\n       session = winrm.Session(host, auth=(username, password))\n       \n       # Run a command remotely\n       result = session.run_cmd('hostname')\n       \n       # Print the output\n       print(result.std_out.decode())\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       main()\n   ```\n\n**Key Points:**\n- The remote machine must have WinRM enabled and configured to accept requests.\n- Ensure that the URL used in the `Session` object points to the correct WinRM listener on your remote machine. The default port for HTTP is `5985`, and for HTTPS is `5986`.\n- You might need to configure the WinRM service on the remote machine to allow basic authentication or create a certificate for HTTPS, depending on your security requirements.\n\n3. **Configure WinRM on the remote machine**: You may need to run the following on the remote machine to configure WinRM (as an administrator):\n\n   ```shell\n   winrm quickconfig\n   winrm set winrm/config/service/auth @{Basic=\"true\"}\n   winrm set winrm/config/service @{AllowUnencrypted=\"true\"}\n   ```\n\nPlease replace the placeholders with actual values for your remote machine's address, username, and password. This should enable you to execute commands on the remote machine and receive the output."
