However, when I attempt to install it, I encounter an error stating that I don't have the latest version of libpq5. Yet, when I try to upgrade libpq5, the system shows that I already have the most recent version. Here's the error I receive when I try to install libpq-dev and libpq5:\n\n```\nlhmendes@lhmendes-GA-78LMT-S2P:~$ sudo apt-get install libpq-dev\nReading package lists...

        "content": "It looks like you are encountering a package version conflict due to the `libpq5` package being installed from the PostgreSQL Global Development Group (PGDG) repository, which is not matching the version required by the `libpq-dev` package in the Ubuntu repositories.\n\nHere's how you can address this issue:\n\n1. **Remove the Existing libpq5 Package:**\n   First, you need to remove the version of `libpq5` that is causing the conflict.\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get remove --purge libpq5\n   ```\n\n2. **Disable or Adjust the PostgreSQL Repository:**\n   If you have added the PostgreSQL repository, it might be causing the version mismatch. You can temporarily disable it or adjust it to ensure compatibility.\n\n   - Open the sources list for editing:\n\n     ```bash\n     sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list\n     ```\n\n   - Comment out the line by adding a `#` at the beginning of the line that adds the PostgreSQL repository. Save and exit the editor.\n\n3. **Update Your Package List:**\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   ```\n\n4. **Install the Correct Version of libpq5 and libpq-dev:**\n\n   Now, install the `libpq5` and `libpq-dev` packages from the Ubuntu repositories:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install libpq5=12.4-0ubuntu0.20.04.1 libpq-dev\n   ```\n\n5. **Re-enable the PostgreSQL Repository:**\n\n   If you commented out the PGDG repository, you can re-enable it by removing the `#` in the `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list` file and then running:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   ```\n\n6. **Install psycopg2 (if not already installed):**\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install psycopg2\n   ```\n\nIf you need the PostgreSQL Global Development Group repository for other packages, you might need to consider pinning specific packages or resolving dependencies manually. However, for most use cases, the Ubuntu repository version should suffice unless you require a specific feature from the PGDG version.\n\nThese steps should help you resolve the dependency conflict and successfully install the required packages."
