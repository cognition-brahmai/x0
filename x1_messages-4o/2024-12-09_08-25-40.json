        "content": "Yes, there is a straightforward way to print the contents of a file to stdout. You can achieve this using several methods in various programming languages or using shell commands. Here are a few options:\n\n### Using Shell Commands\n\n1. **cat Command** (Unix/Linux/Mac):\n   ```bash\n   cat filename.txt\n   ```\n\n2. **type Command** (Windows Command Prompt):\n   ```cmd\n   type filename.txt\n   ```\n\n3. **PowerShell** (Windows PowerShell):\n   ```powershell\n   Get-Content filename.txt\n   ```\n\n### Using Python\n\nYou can use Python to read and print the contents of a file to stdout:\n\n```python\nwith open('filename.txt', 'r') as file:\n    contents = file.read()\n    print(contents)\n```\n\n### Using C\n\nHere's a simple C program to print the contents of a file:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    FILE *file = fopen(\"filename.txt\", \"r\");\n    if (file == NULL) {\n        perror(\"Unable to open file\");\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    char ch;\n    while ((ch = fgetc(file)) != EOF) {\n        putchar(ch);\n    }\n\n    fclose(file);\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Using Java\n\nHere's how you can do it in Java:\n\n```java\nimport java.nio.file.Files;\nimport java.nio.file.Paths;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class ReadFileToStdout {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            String content = new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(\"filename.txt\")));\n            System.out.println(content);\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThese methods will allow you to print the contents of a file to stdout in different environments. Choose the one that best fits your use case."
