The result is stored in a third network which has its parameters set to non-trainable. The third network (placeholder_net) is used to pass the data through. I am concerned that since the parameters of the placeholder network are set to non-trainable, it may not actually train the variable that it should. How does PyTorch treat the situation when a trainable parameter combines with a non-trainable one? \n\nHere is the current solution I am using:\n\n```python\ndel net3.conv0.weight\nnet3.conv0.weight = net.conv0.weight + net2.conv0.weight\n```\nAnd the function for the operation is:\n\n```python\nplaceholder_net.W = Op( not_trainable_net.W, trainable_net.W )\noutput = placeholder_net(input)\n```\n\nWould this result in training the network as expected?"

        "content": "In PyTorch, when you combine parameters from two neural networks and store the result in a third network with non-trainable parameters, you need to be aware of how gradients are handled during backpropagation.\n\nIn your current setup, you're combining weights from two networks and assigning them to a third network's non-trainable parameters. Here's how PyTorch handles this situation:\n\n1. **Parameter Combination**: When you perform operations like `net.conv0.weight + net2.conv0.weight`, the resulting tensor is a new tensor that has no `requires_grad` attribute by default, unless explicitly set. This means that the resulting combined weight assigned to `net3.conv0.weight` will not have gradients calculated for it during backpropagation unless specified otherwise.\n\n2. **Non-Trainable Parameters**: If you set `net3.conv0.weight` to be non-trainable by using `requires_grad_(False)`, PyTorch will not compute gradients for this parameter during backpropagation. Consequently, the optimizer will not update it, which is what you intend since `net3` is supposed to be a placeholder network.\n\n3. **Gradient Flow**: The gradient flow will still correctly propagate back to the original trainable parameters of `net` and `net2` if they have `requires_grad=True`. Therefore, any updates needed for those networks based on the loss will still occur, even though `net3` itself won't be updated.\n\n4. **Ensuring Training of Original Networks**: Since the result of the combination is used in forward passes through `placeholder_net`, the gradients will backpropagate through this network to the original networks (`net` and `net2`) as long as the operations used to combine the parameters are differentiable and the original parameters have `requires_grad=True`.\n\nIn summary, your setup seems correct for your use case. The non-trainable placeholder network will not update its parameters, but it will still allow gradients to flow back to `net` and `net2` so that they can be updated during training. Just ensure that the operations used to combine parameters are differentiable and that `requires_grad=True` for the parameters you want to train in `net` and `net2`."
