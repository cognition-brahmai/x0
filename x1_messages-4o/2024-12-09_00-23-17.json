When I try to load the data using the command `iris = sklearn.datasets.load_iris()`, I encounter an `AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'datasets'`. But when I use `from sklearn import datasets` and then `iris = datasets.load_iris()`, it works fine. I'm also able to use `iris = sklearn.datasets.load_iris()` after this without any issues. Can someone explain why the first method doesn't work, but the other two do? What's the difference between these approaches?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to how Python handles module imports and how namespaces are structured within the `sklearn` package.\n\n1. **Direct Access with `sklearn.datasets`:** \n   When you try to directly access `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()` without any prior import, Python raises an `AttributeError`. This happens because the `sklearn` module itself does not automatically import all its submodules (like `datasets`) upon initial access. The `datasets` submodule is not loaded into memory until you explicitly import it. Therefore, trying to access `sklearn.datasets` directly without importing it first results in Python being unaware of the `datasets` attribute.\n\n2. **Using `from sklearn import datasets`:**\n   When you use the statement `from sklearn import datasets`, you're explicitly importing the `datasets` submodule into your namespace. This makes all the functions and classes within `datasets` directly accessible. As a result, `datasets.load_iris()` works because you have explicitly told Python to load the `datasets` submodule.\n\n3. **Subsequent Access with `sklearn.datasets`:**\n   After you have successfully imported `datasets` using `from sklearn import datasets`, you can then access `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()` without any issues. This is because the `datasets` submodule has now been loaded into memory, and Python recognizes it as part of the `sklearn` namespace.\n\n### Summary:\n- The first approach fails because the `datasets` submodule isn't automatically loaded with `sklearn`.\n- The second approach works because it explicitly imports the `datasets` submodule.\n- After importing, the third approach works because the submodule is already loaded into memory.\n\nTo avoid confusion and ensure your code works as expected, it's a good practice to explicitly import submodules or functions you need, as shown in your second approach."
