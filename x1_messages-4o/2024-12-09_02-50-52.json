        "content": "PEP8 warning E731 suggests that you should not assign a lambda expression directly to a variable and instead use a `def` statement to define a function. This recommendation is primarily for readability and maintainability reasons. Here are a few reasons why using `def` might be preferred over a lambda:\n\n1. **Readability**: Named functions created with `def` can have a descriptive name, which can make the code more readable and understandable. Lambda functions, especially when assigned to variables, can make the code harder to read, especially for more complex expressions.\n\n2. **Line Length**: Lambda expressions are typically limited to a single line, which can lead to long lines of code if the expression is complex. This can make it harder to follow the logic of the code.\n\n3. **Tracebacks**: When debugging, tracebacks involving named functions created with `def` will show the function name, which can be very helpful. Lambda functions, on the other hand, will just show `<lambda>` in the traceback, which can make debugging more difficult.\n\n4. **Reusability**: Defining a function with `def` allows you to easily reuse the function in different parts of your code, whereas a lambda expression might be more limited in its reuse.\n\n5. **Documentation**: Functions defined with `def` can have docstrings, which are useful for documenting what the function does, its parameters, and its return value. Lambdas do not support docstrings.\n\nIn summary, while lambda functions are useful for short, throwaway functions, using `def` to define a function can provide better readability, maintainability, and debuggability, especially for more complex logic. It's not that lambda expressions are not recommended, but rather that they should be used judiciously and in the right context."
