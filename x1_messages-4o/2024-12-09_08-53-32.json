        "content": "Certainly! You can determine if a number is even or odd without using the modulo operator by using bitwise operations. Here's a Python function that does that:\n\n```python\ndef is_even(number):\n    # Check the least significant bit\n    return (number & 1) == 0\n\ndef is_odd(number):\n    # If a number is not even, it is odd\n    return not is_even(number)\n\n# Example usage:\nnum = 42\nif is_even(num):\n    print(f\"{num} is even.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"{num} is odd.\")\n```\n\nIn this code, the `is_even` function checks the least significant bit of the number using the bitwise AND operator (`&`). If the least significant bit is 0, the number is even; otherwise, it is odd. The `is_odd` function simply returns the opposite of `is_even`."
