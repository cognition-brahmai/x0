He'd spent the day playing video games and had been eagerly waiting for her return, hoping she'd join him. But seeing her now, with her backpack hanging low and her eyes heavy with fatigue, Jake realized just how hard Sophie worked at school. He thought about how different their days had been and felt a pang of sympathy. Maybe he could help her relax by making her laugh or offering to do one of her chores."
