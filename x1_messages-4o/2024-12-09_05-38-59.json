The only example I found slightly different is here which has subplots and sets height and width in the creation of a Plot object."

        "content": "In Bokeh, you can change the size of a figure by specifying the `width` and `height` parameters when you create a `figure` object. This allows you to customize the dimensions of your plot according to your needs. Here's a simple example to illustrate how you can set the size of a Bokeh figure:\n\n```python\nfrom bokeh.plotting import figure, show\n\n# Create a new plot with specific dimensions\np = figure(width=800, height=400, title=\"Custom Size Bokeh Plot\")\n\n# Add a line renderer with some example data\np.line([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 2, 4, 5], line_width=2)\n\n# Display the plot\nshow(p)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `figure()` function is called with `width=800` and `height=400`, which sets the width to 800 pixels and the height to 400 pixels. You can adjust these values to fit your requirements.\n\nIf you are working with subplots or layouts, you can still specify the `width` and `height` for each individual figure, or you can use layout functions like `row`, `column`, or `gridplot` from `bokeh.layouts` to arrange multiple plots and control their sizes. Here's a basic example using `gridplot`:\n\n```python\nfrom bokeh.layouts import gridplot\n\n# Create a couple of figures with different sizes\np1 = figure(width=300, height=300, title=\"Plot 1\")\np1.circle([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], size=10, color=\"navy\")\n\np2 = figure(width=600, height=300, title=\"Plot 2\")\np2.line([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [5, 6, 2, 4, 3], line_width=2, color=\"orange\")\n\n# Arrange them in a grid layout\nlayout = gridplot([[p1, p2]])\n\n# Display the plots\nshow(layout)\n```\n\nThis code creates two figures with specified dimensions and arranges them in a grid layout. You can adjust `width` and `height` for each figure to customize the appearance of your plots."
