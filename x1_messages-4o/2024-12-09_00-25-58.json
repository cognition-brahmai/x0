In these cases, should I return `None`, or should I return a tuple with two `None` elements, like this: `(None, None)`? Which option is more stylistically correct or makes more sense?"

        "content": "When deciding between returning `None` or a tuple with `(None, None)` for cases where there is no valid city/state to return, it's important to consider the context in which your method will be used and the conventions that make your code clearer and more maintainable. Here are some points to consider for each option:\n\n1. **Returning `None`:**\n   - **Simplicity:** Returning `None` can be a straightforward way to indicate the absence of a valid result.\n   - **Clarity:** It clearly distinguishes between a valid tuple result and no result at all.\n   - **Common Practice:** It's a common idiom in Python to return `None` when a function does not have a value to return.\n   - **Error Handling:** Users of your method will need to explicitly check for `None` to avoid any `TypeError` when trying to unpack the result.\n\n2. **Returning `(None, None)`:**\n   - **Consistency:** Always returning a tuple, even when no valid data exists, keeps the return type consistent, which can simplify code that processes the result.\n   - **Unpacking:** Callers can always unpack the result without needing to check for `None`, although they will still need to handle the `None` values within the tuple.\n   - **Semantic Clarity:** It explicitly communicates that both the city and state are missing, rather than the absence of any result at all.\n\nUltimately, the decision depends on how you anticipate your method being used and what makes the most sense for your specific application. Here are some guiding questions:\n\n- **Is the absence of data a common or exceptional case?** If it's exceptional, returning `None` might make more sense, as it clearly indicates an exceptional condition.\n- **How are the results typically consumed?** If the results are often unpacked or processed without checking for `None`, a consistent tuple might be more convenient.\n- **What is more intuitive for other developers using your code?** Consider what would be more understandable and maintainable for someone else reading your code.\n\nIf you're still unsure, consider documenting the behavior clearly or providing utility functions or methods that abstract away the handling of these cases."
