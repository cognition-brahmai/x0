I have a list, `m = ['a','b','c']`, and I want to create a new list, `n`, that contains all elements from `m` except for 'a'. However, when I use `m.remove('a')`, the original list `m` is mutated to `['b', 'c']`. I want `m` to remain as `['a', 'b', 'c']` and `n` to be `['b', 'c']`. Is there a way to achieve this in Python?"

        "content": "Yes, you can create a new list from an existing list without mutating the original list by using a list comprehension or the `filter` function. Here are two ways to achieve this:\n\n1. **Using List Comprehension:**\n\n```python\nm = ['a', 'b', 'c']\nn = [x for x in m if x != 'a']\n```\n\nThis code creates a new list `n` by including only those elements from `m` that are not equal to `'a'`.\n\n2. **Using the `filter` Function:**\n\n```python\nm = ['a', 'b', 'c']\nn = list(filter(lambda x: x != 'a', m))\n```\n\nThe `filter` function applies a filtering condition to each element of `m`, returning a new iterator with elements that satisfy the condition. In this case, the condition is that the element should not be `'a'`.\n\nBoth methods will leave your original list `m` unchanged as `['a', 'b', 'c']`, and create a new list `n` containing `['b', 'c']`."
