Now, I need to change the data source from a text file to a CSV file. However, I don't want to split the data on commas, because some values can contain commas if they're enclosed in quotes. I've found out that there is a CSV library in Python that can handle this, but I'm not sure how to use it to load the CSV file into the data array. Here's how I've been handling the text file:\n\n```python\ntextfile = open('file.txt')\ndata = []\nfor line in textfile:\n    row_data = line.strip(\"\\n\").split()\n    for i, item in enumerate(row_data):\n        try:\n            row_data[i] = float(item)\n        except ValueError:\n            pass\n    data.append(row_data)\n```\n\nAnd here's how I'm planning to use the CSV library:\n\n```python\nimport csv\nwith open('file.csv', 'rb') as csvfile:\n    ???\n```\n\nLastly, this is how I plan to use the data:\n\n```python\nrow = 0\nfor row_data in (data):\n    worksheet.write_row(row, 0, row_data)\n    row += 1\n```\n\nHow can I load the CSV file into the data array using the CSV library?"

        "content": "To handle CSV files in Python, you can use the `csv` module, which is part of the standard library. This module is capable of handling values enclosed in quotes and can correctly parse CSV data, including fields that contain commas.\n\nHere's how you can modify your script to read a CSV file and load it into an array using the `csv` library:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\ndata = []\n\n# Open the CSV file with the default newline option\nwith open('file.csv', 'r', newline='') as csvfile:\n    # Create a CSV reader object, specifying the delimiter\n    csvreader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',', quotechar='\"')\n    \n    # Iterate over each row in the CSV file\n    for row in csvreader:\n        # Convert each item to a float if possible, or keep it as a string\n        row_data = []\n        for item in row:\n            try:\n                # Try to convert the item to a float\n                row_data.append(float(item))\n            except ValueError:\n                # If conversion fails, keep the item as a string\n                row_data.append(item)\n        # Append the processed row to the data array\n        data.append(row_data)\n\n# Now you can use the data array as planned\nrow = 0\nfor row_data in data:\n    worksheet.write_row(row, 0, row_data)\n    row += 1\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **CSV Reader**: When using `csv.reader`, you don't need to manually split the lines. It handles the splitting and respects quoted fields.\n- **Newline Handling**: Use `newline=''` in the `open` function to ensure proper handling of line endings across different platforms.\n- **Float Conversion**: Iterate through each value in each row and attempt to convert it to a float, similar to your original script.\n\nThis code will read the CSV file, handle quoted strings with commas correctly, and store the data in the `data` list, ready for further processing or usage."
