The code is structured similarly to this:\n\n```python\nclass MyClass:\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    def call_me(self=''):\n        print(self)\n```\n\nWhen I invoke this method, it works as usual and prints the usual output:\n\n```python\n>>> MyClass().call_me()\n<__main__.MyClass object at 0x000002A12E7CA908>\n```\n\nI am unable to understand the reason behind assigning a default string value to 'self'. Could you explain why someone would pass a string instance as a default value for 'self'?"

        "content": "The code you encountered is a bit unconventional and might be confusing because of how the `self` parameter is used. In Python, `self` is a conventional name for the first parameter of a method in a class. It refers to the instance of the class on which the method is being called. Typically, `self` is not given a default value because it is automatically provided by Python when you call a method on an instance of a class.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's happening in your example:\n\n1. **Default Value for `self`:** While it is syntactically valid to provide a default value for `self`, it is not idiomatic and serves no practical purpose. The `self` parameter is intended to represent the instance of the class, and Python automatically supplies this when you call a method on an object. \n\n2. **Method Invocation:** When you call `MyClass().call_me()`, Python internally calls `MyClass.call_me(instance)`, where `instance` is the object created by `MyClass()`. Thus, the default value for `self` is ignored because the method is called on an instance.\n\n3. **Unusual Usage:** Assigning a default value to `self` doesn't change the behavior of the method since `self` is already being set by Python. The default value would only come into play if you tried to call the method in an unusual way, such as `MyClass.call_me()`, without an instance, but that is not typical or recommended because it bypasses the usual object-oriented principles.\n\nIn summary, setting a default value for `self` is possible but unnecessary and unorthodox. It doesn't serve any practical purpose and can cause confusion. It's best to avoid it and stick to the conventional usage where `self` is automatically handled by Python."
