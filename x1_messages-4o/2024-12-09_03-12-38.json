However, when I use 'order_by('creation_date')' in my query, and later call 'instances.latest()', it doesn't return the latest instance, but the first one. This also happens when I test it manually using python manage.py shell. I expected '.latest()' to always return the most recent instance based on a 'creation_date' field. Is it correct that '.latest()' behaves differently when you use 'order_by' in the query?\n\n<pre><code>class MyModel(models.Model):\n   creation_date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add = True, editable=False)\n\n   class Meta:\n      get_latest_by = 'creation_date'\n      \n# Query in the view\ninstances = MyModel.objects.all().order_by('creation_date')\n</code></pre>"

        "content": "In Django, the behavior you're observing is due to how the `latest()` method interacts with the `order_by()` method. When you call `latest()` on a queryset, Django uses the field specified in the model's `Meta` class `get_latest_by` attribute to determine the \"latest\" object, but it does not take into account any ordering you've explicitly specified in the queryset with `order_by()`.\n\nHere's what's happening in your code:\n\n1. **`order_by('creation_date')`:** This sorts the queryset in ascending order based on the `creation_date`. So, the oldest instance is first, and the newest is last.\n\n2. **`latest()`:** When you call `latest()`, Django looks at the `get_latest_by` specified in the `Meta` class, which is `creation_date`, and returns the instance with the latest `creation_date`.\n\nHowever, if you've used `order_by()` in your queryset, it can interfere with what `latest()` is designed to do, because `latest()` does not reverse the order set by `order_by()`.\n\nTo ensure you get the most recent instance, you should either:\n\n1. Remove the `order_by()` clause when using `latest()`:\n\n   ```python\n   latest_instance = MyModel.objects.latest()\n   ```\n\n2. Use `order_by('-creation_date')` to sort the instances in descending order and then get the first one:\n\n   ```python\n   latest_instance = MyModel.objects.order_by('-creation_date').first()\n   ```\n\nBoth of these approaches will give you the most recent instance based on the `creation_date`. The second approach explicitly orders the queryset in descending order, making it clear which item is the latest, while the first approach leverages the `get_latest_by` setting in the model's Meta class."
