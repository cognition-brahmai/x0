        "content": "Is the XGBoost documentation incorrect about 'early stopping rounds' and the return of the best and last iteration? According to the documentation, when the fit stops due to the 'early stopping rounds' parameter, the model returned is not the best one but the last one. However, when I use this parameter with my data, it seems that the model returned is the best one, not the last one. I used the following code:\n\n```python\nreg = xgb.XGBRegressor(n_jobs=6, n_estimators = 100, max_depth= 5)\nreg.fit(\n   X_train, \n   y_train, \n   eval_metric='rmse',    \n   eval_set=[(X_train, y_train), (X_valid, y_valid)],\n   verbose=True,\n   early_stopping_rounds = 6)\n```\n\nThe output I get is:\n\n```python\n[71]    validation_0-rmse:1.70071   validation_1-rmse:1.9382\n[72]    validation_0-rmse:1.69806   validation_1-rmse:1.93825\n[73]    validation_0-rmse:1.69732   validation_1-rmse:1.93803\nStopping. Best iteration:\n[67]    validation_0-rmse:1.70768   validation_1-rmse:1.93734\n```\n\nAnd the root mean square error (RMSE) I get when checking the validation values is 1.9373418403889535, which is exactly the best score, not the last one. Is the XGBoost documentation wrong, or am I misunderstanding something?"

        "content": "Based on the behavior you observed and the output you shared, it appears that the XGBoost library is indeed returning the model associated with the best iteration rather than the last one when early stopping is triggered. This is consistent with the intended functionality of early stopping in many machine learning libraries, where the goal is to prevent overfitting by selecting the model that performed best on the validation set.\n\nThe XGBoost documentation may not have been updated to clearly reflect this behavior, or there might have been a misunderstanding in how the documentation is phrased. The function of early stopping is generally to stop training when no improvement is observed for a specified number of rounds, and to keep the model at the iteration that had the best evaluation performance.\n\nIn your case, the best iteration is shown to be at round 67, where the validation RMSE was the lowest (1.93734). Therefore, the model returned by the `fit` method is indeed the one from this best iteration, which aligns with your observations.\n\nTo be certain, you could check the version of the XGBoost library you are using and ensure that you're looking at the documentation corresponding to that version. If there is a discrepancy or a need for clarification, you might consider reaching out to the XGBoost maintainers or reviewing the latest version of the documentation or release notes for any updates regarding this behavior."
