I have a text file which has lines as follows:\n\n```\nblah blah\nfoo1 bar1\nfoo1 bar2\nfoo1 bar3\nfoo2 bar4\nfoo2 bar5\nblah blah\n```\n\nI want to insert 'foo bar' between 'foo1 bar3' and 'foo2 bar4'. I have tried to implement a solution with the following code:\n\n```python\nimport shutil\n\ntxt = '1.txt'\ntmptxt = '1.txt.tmp'\n\nwith open(tmptxt, 'w') as outfile:\n    with open(txt, 'r') as infile:\n        flag = 0\n        for line in infile:\n            if not line.startswith('foo1') and flag == 0:\n                outfile.write(line)\n                continue\n            if line.startswith('foo1') and flag == 0:\n                flag = 1\n                outfile.write(line)\n                continue\n            if line.startswith('foo1') and flag == 1:\n                outfile.write(line)\n                continue\n            if not line.startswith('foo1') and flag == 1:\n                outfile.write('foo bar\\n')\n                outfile.write(line)\n                flag = 2\n                continue\n            if not line.startswith('foo1') and flag == 2:\n                outfile.write(line)\n                continue\n\nshutil.move(tmptxt, txt)\n```\n\nThis works, but it doesn't seem efficient. Is there a better way to achieve this?"

        "content": "Your current solution is functional, but there is a more concise and efficient way to achieve the same result by using a list to store the lines and then manipulating the list before writing it back to the file. Here's a more streamlined approach:\n\n```python\ntxt = '1.txt'\n\n# Read all lines from the file\nwith open(txt, 'r') as file:\n    lines = file.readlines()\n\n# Find the index where you want to insert the new line\nfor index, line in enumerate(lines):\n    if line.startswith('foo2'):\n        break\n\n# Insert the new line at the determined index\nlines.insert(index, 'foo bar\\n')\n\n# Write the lines back to the file\nwith open(txt, 'w') as file:\n    file.writelines(lines)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Read All Lines**: First, you read all the lines from the file into a list. This allows you to easily manipulate the order and content.\n   \n2. **Determine Insertion Point**: By iterating over the list with `enumerate`, you find the index where `'foo2 bar4'` starts. This tells you where to insert `'foo bar'`.\n\n3. **Insert the New Line**: Use the `insert` method of the list to add the new line at the specified index.\n\n4. **Write Back to the File**: Finally, write the modified list of lines back to the file.\n\nThis approach simplifies the logic by leveraging Python's list operations, making it more readable and efficient."
