        "content": "This issue is commonly related to Python's module search path. By default, Python only searches for modules in the current directory and in directories listed in the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable. To resolve this import error, you can use a few different approaches:\n\n1. **Modify `sys.path` in Your Test Script**: Before importing your source modules, you can modify the `sys.path` list to include the path to your `src` directory. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n    ```python\n    import sys\n    import os\n\n    # Get the current directory of the test file\n    test_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))\n    \n    # Construct the path to the 'src' directory\n    src_dir = os.path.join(test_dir, '..', 'src')\n    \n    # Add the 'src' directory to the system path\n    sys.path.insert(0, src_dir)\n\n    # Now you can import your source modules\n    import ASourceModule\n    ```\n\n2. **Set the `PYTHONPATH` Environment Variable**: You can set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to include the `src` directory. This tells Python where to look for modules:\n\n    - On macOS/Linux, run the following command in your terminal:\n      ```bash\n      export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/your/src\n      python tests/myTest.py\n      ```\n    \n    - On Windows, run the following in your command prompt:\n      ```cmd\n      set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:\\path\\to\\your\\src\n      python tests\\myTest.py\n      ```\n\n3. **Use a Virtual Environment with Editable Install**: If you are using a virtual environment, you can install your source directory as an editable package. This is more suitable for larger projects:\n\n    - First, create a `setup.py` file in your project\u2019s root directory with content like this:\n      ```python\n      from setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\n      setup(\n          name='yourprojectname',\n          version='0.1',\n          packages=find_packages(where='src'),\n          package_dir={'': 'src'},\n      )\n      ```\n    \n    - Then, in your virtual environment, run:\n      ```bash\n      pip install -e .\n      ```\n\n4. **Use Relative Imports**: If your test files and source files are part of a package with an `__init__.py` file, you can use relative imports in your test files:\n\n    ```python\n    from ..src import ASourceModule\n    ```\n\n    However, note that this requires that your tests are also part of a package.\n\nChoose the method that best fits your project structure and workflow."
