        "content": "To calculate the coefficient of \\( x \\) in the polynomial equation \\( 2x^2 + x + 1 \\), you can directly observe the equation. The coefficient of \\( x \\) is simply the numerical factor that multiplies the \\( x \\) term. In this polynomial, the coefficient of \\( x \\) is 1.\n\n### MATLAB Code to Extract the Coefficient of \\( x \\)\n\nHere is a simple MATLAB code to extract the coefficient of \\( x \\):\n\n```matlab\n% Define the polynomial coefficients\ncoefficients = [2, 1, 1]; % Corresponds to 2x^2 + 1x + 1\n\n% Extract the coefficient of x\ncoefficient_of_x = coefficients(2);\n\n% Display the result\nfprintf('The coefficient of x is: %d\\n', coefficient_of_x);\n```\n\n### Alternative Methods\n\n#### Method 1: Using Symbolic Math Toolbox\n\nYou can use the Symbolic Math Toolbox in MATLAB to manipulate and extract coefficients symbolically.\n\n```matlab\n% Define the symbolic variable\nsyms x;\n\n% Define the polynomial\npolynomial = 2*x^2 + x + 1;\n\n% Extract the coefficient of x\ncoefficient_of_x = coeffs(polynomial, x);\n\n% Display the result\nfprintf('The coefficient of x is: %d\\n', coefficient_of_x(2));\n```\n\n#### Method 2: Using Polynomial Functions\n\nMATLAB provides functions to handle polynomials, such as `polyval` and `polyder`, but these are generally used for evaluation and differentiation. For coefficient extraction, direct indexing is preferred. However, for larger polynomials or more complex manipulations, these functions can be useful in combination with indexing.\n\nHere is an example of defining and evaluating the polynomial:\n\n```matlab\n% Define the polynomial coefficients\ncoefficients = [2, 1, 1]; % Corresponds to 2x^2 + 1x + 1\n\n% Evaluate the polynomial at x = 1 to verify it's structure\nvalue_at_1 = polyval(coefficients, 1);\n\n% Extract the coefficient of x\ncoefficient_of_x = coefficients(2);\n\n% Display the result\nfprintf('The coefficient of x is: %d\\n', coefficient_of_x);\nfprintf('The value of the polynomial at x = 1 is: %d\\n', value_at_1);\n```\n\nThese methods allow you to work with polynomials in MATLAB and extract specific coefficients as needed. The direct indexing method is the simplest and most efficient way to access specific coefficients when the polynomial is represented by a vector of coefficients."
