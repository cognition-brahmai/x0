        "content": "The error you are encountering is due to an incompatibility between the version of the `click` package and the `black` package you are using. The error message indicates that the `_unicodefun` module cannot be imported from `click`, which typically happens when there are version mismatches.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check the Versions**: First, check the versions of `click` and `black` installed in your environment. You can do this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip show click black\n   ```\n\n2. **Upgrade/Downgrade Packages**: Ensure that you are using compatible versions of these packages. You can upgrade or downgrade them as needed:\n\n   - Upgrade `black` and `click` to the latest versions:\n\n     ```bash\n     pip install --upgrade black click\n     ```\n\n   - If the issue persists after upgrading, you may need to downgrade `click` to a version that is known to work with your version of `black`. For example, if the latest version doesn't work, try:\n\n     ```bash\n     pip install click==8.0.1\n     ```\n\n   Adjust the version number according to the compatibility requirement.\n\n3. **Check for Known Issues**: Sometimes, specific versions of libraries have known issues. Check the GitHub repository or the issues page of `black` for any known conflicts with `click`.\n\n4. **Virtual Environment**: If you're still facing issues, consider setting up a virtual environment and installing the packages afresh. This can help isolate dependencies and avoid conflicts:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `myenv\\Scripts\\activate`\n   pip install black\n   ```\n\n5. **Reinstall Packages**: Sometimes, simply reinstalling the packages can help resolve conflicts due to corrupted installations:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall black click\n   pip install black\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the ImportError related to `_unicodefun` from `click`. If the problem persists, please provide more details about your environment and the versions you are using."
