The script retrieves file names from the sys.argv list. However, I'm having difficulty launching the script with arguments in PyCharm. I've tried entering arguments into the \"Script parameters\" field in the \"Run\" > \"Edit configuration\" menu like this: `-s'file1.txt', -s'file2.txt'`, but it doesn't seem to work. How can I successfully launch my script with arguments in PyCharm on Ubuntu?"

        "content": "When running a script in PyCharm and you need to pass command line arguments, it's important to ensure that they are correctly formatted in the \"Script parameters\" field. Here\u2019s how you can set it up:\n\n1. **Open the Run/Debug Configurations:**\n   - Go to the top right corner of PyCharm and click on the dropdown menu where you can select the run configuration.\n   - Click on \"Edit Configurations\".\n\n2. **Set the Script Parameters:**\n   - In the \"Run/Debug Configurations\" dialog, select your script from the list on the left.\n   - Find the \"Script parameters\" field.\n\n3. **Correct Parameter Formatting:**\n   - It seems like you are trying to use options (`-s`) with parameters. Ensure that there is a space between the option and the argument. \n   - If `-s` is a flag that requires a file name, your parameters should look like this:\n     ```\n     -s file1.txt -s file2.txt\n     ```\n   - Avoid using single quotes around the file names unless your script specifically requires them.\n\n4. **Using Absolute or Relative Paths:**\n   - If the script requires the full path, make sure to provide the absolute path to the files. For example:\n     ```\n     -s /path/to/directory/file1.txt -s /path/to/directory/file2.txt\n     ```\n   - If using relative paths, make sure the working directory is correctly set to the directory containing your files.\n\n5. **Check the Working Directory:**\n   - Ensure the \"Working directory\" is set to the directory where your files are located. This can also be set in the \"Run/Debug Configurations\" dialog.\n\n6. **Run the Script:**\n   - Once everything is set, click \"Apply\" and then \"OK\" to save your configuration.\n   - Run your script using the configured run button.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully pass command line arguments to your script in PyCharm on Ubuntu. If you encounter any errors, double-check the syntax and paths provided in the \"Script parameters\" field."
