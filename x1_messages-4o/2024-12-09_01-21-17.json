        "content": "I want to use Python's mock.patch and change the return value for each call. The function I am patching doesn't take any inputs, so I can't vary the return value based on the input. I am trying to mock out the user's input using 'io.prompt', which is a platform independent version of \"input\" for Python 2 and 3. Here's my code:\n\nFunction to be patched:\n```python\ndef get_boolean_response():\n    response = io.prompt('y/n').lower()\n    while response not in ('y', 'n', 'yes', 'no'):\n        io.echo('Not a valid input. Try again')\n        response = io.prompt('y/n').lower()\n    return response in ('y', 'yes')\n```\n\nMy test code:\n```python\n@mock.patch('io')\ndef test_get_boolean_response(self, mock_io):\n    # Setup\n    mock_io.prompt.return_value = ['x','y']\n    result = operations.get_boolean_response()\n\n    # Test\n    self.assertTrue(result)\n    self.assertEqual(mock_io.prompt.call_count, 2)\n```\n\nThe problem is that if the return value is something invalid, I get an infinite loop. I need a way to eventually change the return value, so that my test actually finishes. How can I accomplish this?"

        "content": "To handle this scenario, you can use the `side_effect` attribute of the mock object. The `side_effect` attribute allows you to specify a list of return values that the mock should use for each successive call. In your case, you can specify a list of responses that the `io.prompt` mock will return for each call, thereby controlling the flow of the loop in your test.\n\nHere's an updated version of your test code using `side_effect`:\n\n```python\nfrom unittest import mock, TestCase\nimport operations  # Assuming your function is in a module named 'operations'\n\nclass TestOperations(TestCase):\n    @mock.patch('operations.io')  # Make sure to patch the correct path\n    def test_get_boolean_response(self, mock_io):\n        # Setup the side_effect to return different values on successive calls\n        mock_io.prompt.side_effect = ['x', 'y']\n        \n        # Call the function being tested\n        result = operations.get_boolean_response()\n        \n        # Test the expected outcome\n        self.assertTrue(result)  # Expecting True because 'y' should return True\n        self.assertEqual(mock_io.prompt.call_count, 2)  # Ensure it was called twice\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`side_effect`**: By setting `side_effect` to a list `['x', 'y']`, the first call to `mock_io.prompt()` will return `'x'`, and the second call will return `'y'`. This simulates the user entering an invalid input followed by a valid input.\n- **`mock.patch`**: Ensure you patch the correct module path where the `io` object is being imported or used. In this example, it's assumed that the function `get_boolean_response()` is in a module named `operations`.\n- **`TestCase`**: This is a test class inheriting from `unittest.TestCase`, which contains the test method `test_get_boolean_response`.\n\nThis setup ensures that your test will not enter an infinite loop, as it will exit the loop after receiving the valid input `'y'` on the second call."
