The dates in the file are formatted as DD/MM/YYYY and I need to convert them to the format YYYY-MM-DD before saving them into a SQLite database. However, when I try to do this using a datetime object, I am met with a ValueError because I am not providing time. Here's what my current code looks like:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nlastconnection = datetime.strptime(\"21/12/2008\", \"%Y-%m-%d\")\n\n# ValueError: time data did not match format:  data=21/12/2008  fmt=%Y-%m-%d\nprint lastconnection\n```\n\nIs there a method in the datetime object that can easily perform this conversion? How can I solve this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering arises from using the incorrect format string in the `strptime` method. The format string you've provided (`\"%Y-%m-%d\"`) doesn't match the format of the date string you're parsing (`\"21/12/2008\"`). The date string is in `DD/MM/YYYY` format, so you need to use the correct format string `\"%d/%m/%Y\"`.\n\nHere's how you can correctly parse the date and then convert it to the desired format:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Correctly parse the date using the format of the input string\nlastconnection = datetime.strptime(\"21/12/2008\", \"%d/%m/%Y\")\n\n# Convert the datetime object to the desired format\nformatted_date = lastconnection.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n\n# Print the formatted date\nprint(formatted_date)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n2008-12-21\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- `strptime` is used to parse the date string `\"21/12/2008\"` using the format `\"%d/%m/%Y\"`.\n- `strftime` is then used to format the `datetime` object into the desired `YYYY-MM-DD` format.\n\nYou can apply this approach for each date you read from your CSV file before inserting it into your SQLite database."
