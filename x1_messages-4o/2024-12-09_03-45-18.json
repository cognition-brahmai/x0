Can anyone guide me on how to delete subplots in matplotlib?"

        "content": "To dynamically delete subplots in Matplotlib, using the `remove` method on axes is not directly supported, which is why you're encountering a `NotImplementedError`. Instead, you can achieve similar functionality by clearing the axes and adjusting the layout.\n\nHere's a way to effectively \"remove\" a subplot by hiding it and rearranging the remaining subplots:\n\n1. **Clear and Hide the Axes**: You can clear the content of the subplot and hide it from the figure.\n\n2. **Adjust the Layout**: You might want to reconfigure your subplot layout manually after hiding a subplot.\n\nHere's an example of how you can dynamically \"remove\" a subplot:\n\n```python\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n\n# Create a figure with 1 row and 3 columns of subplots\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3)\n\n# Plot some data on the first and the third subplot\naxs[0].plot([1, 2], [3, 4])\naxs[2].plot([0, 1], [2, 3])\n\n# Function to \"remove\" a subplot\ndef remove_subplot(ax):\n    ax.clear()  # Clear the content\n    ax.set_visible(False)  # Hide the subplot\n\n# Example: Remove the middle subplot\nremove_subplot(axs[1])\n\n# Optionally, adjust the layout manually\nfig.subplots_adjust(wspace=0.5)  # Adjust the space between subplots\n\n# Redraw the figure with updated layout\nplt.draw()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Clear and Hide**: The `ax.clear()` method clears the content of the subplot, and `ax.set_visible(False)` hides it from the figure.\n- **Adjust Layout**: If you want to ensure the layout looks good after hiding a subplot, you can manually adjust the spacing between subplots using `fig.subplots_adjust()`.\n\nThis approach allows you to effectively \"remove\" a subplot by making it invisible and ensuring the rest of your layout adjusts accordingly."
