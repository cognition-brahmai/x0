        "content": "Certainly! Below is the SQL code to create and populate the `customers` and `orders` tables, as well as an optimized query to retrieve the top 5 customers with the highest order values.\n\n### SQL Code to Create and Populate Tables\n\nFirst, create the tables:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE customers (\n    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    name VARCHAR(255),\n    email VARCHAR(255)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE orders (\n    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    customer_id INT,\n    order_date DATE,\n    order_value DECIMAL(10, 2),\n    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)\n);\n```\n\nNext, populate the tables with sample data:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO customers (customer_id, name, email) VALUES\n(1, 'John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com'),\n(2, 'Jane Smith', 'jane.smith@example.com'),\n(3, 'Emily Davis', 'emily.davis@example.com'),\n(4, 'Michael Brown', 'michael.brown@example.com'),\n(5, 'Jessica White', 'jessica.white@example.com');\n\nINSERT INTO orders (order_id, customer_id, order_date, order_value) VALUES\n(101, 1, '2023-01-15', 150.00),\n(102, 2, '2023-02-20', 250.00),\n(103, 3, '2023-03-25', 350.00),\n(104, 2, '2023-04-10', 450.00),\n(105, 4, '2023-05-05', 550.00),\n(106, 1, '2023-06-15', 200.00),\n(107, 5, '2023-07-20', 100.00),\n(108, 3, '2023-08-25', 400.00),\n(109, 1, '2023-09-30', 300.00),\n(110, 4, '2023-10-10', 250.00);\n```\n\n### Optimized SQL Query to Retrieve Top 5 Customers\n\nTo retrieve the top 5 customers with the highest total order values, you can use the following SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT c.customer_id, c.name, c.email, SUM(o.order_value) AS total_order_value\nFROM customers c\nJOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id\nGROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name, c.email\nORDER BY total_order_value DESC\nLIMIT 5;\n```\n\n### Explanation and Optimization:\n\n1. **JOIN**: The query uses an inner join between `customers` and `orders` tables on the `customer_id` to relate customer details with their orders.\n\n2. **SUM**: It calculates the total order value for each customer using the `SUM` function.\n\n3. **GROUP BY**: The grouping is done on `customer_id`, `name`, and `email` to ensure that each customer's total order value is computed.\n\n4. **ORDER BY**: The results are sorted in descending order based on the `total_order_value` to get the highest values at the top.\n\n5. **LIMIT**: The query limits the result to the top 5 customers.\n\nThis query is optimized for performance by using proper indexing on `customer_id` in both tables, which is usually automatically indexed as a primary key. Additionally, ensuring that there are no duplicate entries in the `orders` table by maintaining unique `order_id` values helps in maintaining data consistency."
