If I have already sampled `n` numbers and now want to sample one more without replacement (meaning it should not include any of the previously sampled `n` numbers), how can I do this in a super efficient manner, ignoring constant factors?"

        "content": "To efficiently sample one more number without replacement, given that you have already sampled `n` numbers, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Use a Set for Already Sampled Numbers:** Keep track of the numbers you have already sampled in a set. Sets in Python provide average O(1) time complexity for membership checks, which is useful for ensuring that the new number hasn't been sampled yet.\n\n2. **Sample a New Number:** Use a loop to repeatedly sample a new number until you find one that is not in your set of already sampled numbers.\n\nHere's a small example of how you might implement this:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# Suppose these are the numbers already sampled\nsampled_numbers = set(random.sample(range(100), 10))\n\n# Function to sample one more number without replacement\ndef sample_one_more(existing_samples, total_range):\n    while True:\n        new_number = random.randint(0, total_range - 1)\n        if new_number not in existing_samples:\n            return new_number\n\n# Sample one more number\nnew_sample = sample_one_more(sampled_numbers, 100)\nprint(f\"Newly sampled number: {new_sample}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Set for O(1) Lookups:** By storing the previously sampled numbers in a set, you can efficiently check if a new number has already been sampled.\n- **Loop Until Unique Number Found:** The `while` loop continues to generate random numbers until it finds one that is not in the set of previously sampled numbers. This ensures the new sample is unique.\n- **Random Sampling:** The `random.randint(0, total_range - 1)` function is used to generate a random number within the desired range.\n\nThis approach is efficient because it leverages the average O(1) time complexity of set operations for checking membership, and it only requires a loop to find a new unique number, which is generally quick as long as `n` is significantly less than the total range."
