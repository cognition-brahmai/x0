I've read through the psycopg2 documentation, looked at the setup.cfg file, and I've gotten the list of options supported but I'm not sure where to go from there. Can you guide me on how to resolve this issue?"

        "content": "Certainly! The error you're encountering is due to the `pg_config` executable not being found in your system's PATH. This executable is provided by the PostgreSQL development package, which is necessary for building `psycopg2` from source. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Install PostgreSQL Development Package:**\n   - On **Ubuntu/Debian**:\n     ```bash\n     sudo apt-get update\n     sudo apt-get install libpq-dev\n     ```\n\n   - On **Fedora**:\n     ```bash\n     sudo dnf install postgresql-devel\n     ```\n\n   - On **macOS** (using Homebrew):\n     ```bash\n     brew install postgresql\n     ```\n\n   - On **Windows**: \n     Make sure PostgreSQL is installed and `pg_config` is in your PATH. You might need to install PostgreSQL from [here](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads) if it's not already installed.\n\n2. **Ensure `pg_config` is in PATH:**\n   - Verify that `pg_config` is accessible by running:\n     ```bash\n     which pg_config\n     ```\n   - If it returns a path, you're good. If not, you need to locate `pg_config` and add its directory to your PATH.\n\n3. **Install psycopg2:**\n   - Once the development package is installed and `pg_config` is in your PATH, try installing `psycopg2` again using pip:\n     ```bash\n     pip install psycopg2\n     ```\n\n4. **Alternative Installation:**\n   - If you continue to face issues, you can install the binary package `psycopg2-binary`, which doesn't require building from source:\n     ```bash\n     pip install psycopg2-binary\n     ```\n   - Note: `psycopg2-binary` is intended for development and testing. For production, it's recommended to use the source package installed with `pip install psycopg2` after resolving the `pg_config` issue.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `pg_config` error and successfully install `psycopg2`. If you encounter further issues, please let me know!"
