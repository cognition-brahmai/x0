Here's a code example:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport string\n\ndef generate_password(length=8):\n    if length < 2:\n        raise ValueError(\"Password length must be at least 2 to include both a number and a letter.\")\n\n    # Ensure the password has at least one letter and one number\n    letters = string.ascii_letters\n    digits = string.digits\n\n    # Start with one random letter and one random number\n    password = [random.choice(letters), random.choice(digits)]\n\n    # Fill the rest of the password length with random characters\n    all_characters = letters + digits\n    password += random.choices(all_characters, k=length-2)\n\n    # Shuffle to prevent a predictable pattern\n    random.shuffle(password)\n\n    return ''.join(password)\n\n# Generate a random password of 8 characters\nrandom_password = generate_password(8)\nprint(\"Generated Password:\", random_password)\n```\n\nThis script ensures that your password is 8 characters long and includes at least one letter and one number. The `random.shuffle()` function is used to randomize the order of characters in the password."
