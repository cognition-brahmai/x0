However, when importing the package from a different project and running `mypy`, I receive the following error: `error: Skipping analyzing 'XXX': found module but no type hints or library stubs`. As I understand, this error occurs because my package is not compliant with PEP-561. I have tried a manual process to add the required files to the package by running `stubgen` to create stub files, creating `py.typed` files in every directory, and collecting all the created files in a `dict` in the `package_data` field in the `setup.py` file. This process solves the issue and `mypy` runs without errors, but it feels convoluted. Is there a best practice or standard tool to make a package PEP-561 compliant?"

        "content": "To make your Python package PEP-561 compliant, which ensures that type information is available to type checkers like `mypy`, you generally need to follow a few steps. However, the process can be streamlined compared to what you've described. Here\u2019s a more straightforward approach:\n\n1. **Include a `py.typed` File**: You need to include a `py.typed` file in your package to indicate that your package supports type hints. This file can be empty but must be present in the root of your package.\n\n2. **Modify `setup.py`**: Ensure that your `setup.py` file specifies the inclusion of the `py.typed` file in the package data. Here's a typical setup:\n\n   ```python\n   from setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\n   setup(\n       name='your_package_name',\n       version='0.1.0',\n       packages=find_packages(),\n       include_package_data=True,\n       package_data={'your_package_name': ['py.typed']},\n       # other arguments...\n   )\n   ```\n\n3. **Type Annotations in Code**: Ensure that your Python code is fully annotated with type hints. You don't need to create stub files (`.pyi`) if your code is already annotated and the `py.typed` file is present.\n\n4. **Verify with `mypy`**: Once you package your project and install it in another environment, `mypy` should recognize the type hints if the above steps are followed correctly.\n\nBy following these steps, you can avoid the complexity of generating separate stub files with `stubgen`, as long as your code is already type-annotated. The presence of the `py.typed` file and the correct setup in `package_data` are usually sufficient to comply with PEP-561."
