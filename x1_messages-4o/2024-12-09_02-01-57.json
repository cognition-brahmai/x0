I used global variables in threads module with success but I am not able to retrieve updates done in subprocesses when using multiprocessing module. The results printed at the end are always the same as initial values given the variables `dataDV03` and `dataDV03`. The subprocesses are updating these global variables but these global variables remain unchanged in the parent. Could you help me find where I'm going wrong?\n\nHere is the code I'm working with:\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\n\nants = ['DV03', 'DV04']\ndataDV03 = ['', '']\ndataDV04 = {'driver': '', 'status': ''}\n\ndef getDV03CclDrivers(lib):  # call global variable\n    global dataDV03\n    dataDV03[1] = 1\n    dataDV03[0] = 0\n\ndef getDV04CclDrivers(lib, dataDV04):   # pass global variable\n    dataDV04['driver'] = 0  \n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    jobs = []\n    if 'DV03' in ants:\n        j = multiprocessing.Process(target=getDV03CclDrivers, args=('LORR',))\n        jobs.append(j)\n\n    if 'DV04' in ants:\n        j = multiprocessing.Process(target=getDV04CclDrivers, args=('LORR', dataDV04))\n        jobs.append(j)\n\n    for j in jobs:\n        j.start()\n\n    for j in jobs:\n        j.join()\n\n    print 'Results:\\n'\n    print 'DV03', dataDV03\n    print 'DV04', dataDV04\n```\n\nAlso, here is the object that is not picklable:\n\n```python\nfrom CCL import LORR\nlorr=LORR.LORR('DV20', None)\n```\n\nAnd this is the error returned when I use a multiprocessing.Pool to return the instance back to the parent:\n\n```python\nThread getCcl (('DV20', 'LORR'),)\nProcess PoolWorker-1:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"/alma/ACS-10.1/casa/lib/python2.6/multiprocessing/process.py\", line 232, in _bootstrap\nself.run()\nFile \"/alma/ACS-10.1/casa/lib/python2.6/multiprocessing/process.py\", line 88, in run\nself._target(*self._args, **self._kwargs)\nFile \"/alma/ACS-10.1/casa/lib/python2.6/multiprocessing/pool.py\", line 71, in worker\nput((job, i, result))\nFile \"/alma/ACS-10.1/casa/lib/python2.6/multiprocessing/queues.py\", line 366, in put\nreturn send(obj)\nUnpickleableError: Cannot pickle <type 'thread.lock'> objects\n```"

        "content": "The main issue you're encountering is due to the way the `multiprocessing` module in Python handles data sharing between processes. Unlike threads, which share the same memory space, processes have their own separate memory space. This means global variables in each subprocess are isolated and changes made to them won't reflect in the parent process.\n\nHere are a few strategies to tackle this problem:\n\n### 1. Use `multiprocessing.Manager` for Shared Data\n\nYou can use `multiprocessing.Manager` to create shared data structures, like lists and dictionaries, that can be updated by subprocesses and accessed by the parent process.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use `Manager`:\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\n\ndef getDV03CclDrivers(lib, dataDV03):\n    dataDV03[1] = 1\n    dataDV03[0] = 0\n\ndef getDV04CclDrivers(lib, dataDV04):\n    dataDV04['driver'] = 0  \n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    manager = multiprocessing.Manager()\n    dataDV03 = manager.list(['', ''])\n    dataDV04 = manager.dict({'driver': '', 'status': ''})\n\n    jobs = []\n    ants = ['DV03', 'DV04']\n\n    if 'DV03' in ants:\n        j = multiprocessing.Process(target=getDV03CclDrivers, args=('LORR', dataDV03))\n        jobs.append(j)\n\n    if 'DV04' in ants:\n        j = multiprocessing.Process(target=getDV04CclDrivers, args=('LORR', dataDV04))\n        jobs.append(j)\n\n    for j in jobs:\n        j.start()\n\n    for j in jobs:\n        j.join()\n\n    print('Results:\\n')\n    print('DV03', dataDV03)\n    print('DV04', dataDV04)\n```\n### 2. Use `multiprocessing.Queue` or `multiprocessing.Pipe`\n\nAnother approach is to use `Queue` or `Pipe` to send data back to the parent process.\n\n### 3. Addressing the Unpickleable Error\n\nThe error you're encountering while trying to use a `multiprocessing.Pool` is likely due to the fact that some objects, like thread locks, cannot be pickled. When you attempt to pass such objects between processes, you will encounter pickling errors.\n\nIf the object `LORR.LORR` contains unpicklable parts, you will need to refactor your code to avoid passing these objects directly between processes. You can potentially create a picklable representation of the data that you need to pass or use shared memory constructs provided by `multiprocessing`.\n\nIf you only need specific data from the `LORR` object, extract that data and pass it instead of the entire object. Alternatively, reconstruct the object in each subprocess using the data you pass.\n\nBy implementing these changes, you should be able to share data between processes effectively and avoid pickling errors."
