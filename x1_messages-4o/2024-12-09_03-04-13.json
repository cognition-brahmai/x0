In Python's regex documentation, it mentions that backslashes are not handled in any special way in a string literal prefixed with 'r'. How does this raw string notation work? If a raw string format is used, does it interpret '*' as a literal character rather than a zero-or-more indicator? Also, how does it recognize newline characters if \"\\n\" is literally a backslash and an \"n\"? Furthermore, I am trying to understand how a raw string regex matches newlines, tabs, and character sets, such as '\\w' for words or '\\d' for digits, if raw string patterns don't recognize backslashes as anything more than ordinary characters. Could you provide some examples?"

        "content": "In Python, a \"raw string\" is a string prefixed with an 'r' or 'R', such as `r\"your_string\"`, and it tells Python to treat backslashes (`\\`) as literal characters. This is particularly useful when dealing with regular expressions (regex) where backslashes are commonly used as escape characters.\n\n### How Raw Strings Work:\n\n1. **Backslashes**: In a regular string, a backslash is used as an escape character. For example, `\"\\n\"` is interpreted as a newline character. In a raw string, the backslash is treated as a literal character, so `r\"\\n\"` is interpreted as the characters `\\` and `n`.\n\n2. **Regex Special Characters**: In regex, backslashes are used to give special meaning to characters, such as `\\d` for digits or `\\w` for word characters. When you use a raw string to define a regex pattern, you don't need to escape these backslashes again.\n\n3. **Special Characters in Regex**: The raw string notation doesn't affect special regex symbols like `*`, which still act as quantifiers. So, `r\"\\d*\"` will correctly match zero or more digits.\n\n### Examples:\n\nHere are some examples of how raw strings are used with regular expressions:\n\n1. **Matching Digits**:\n   ```python\n   import re\n\n   pattern = r\"\\d+\"  # Matches one or more digits\n   result = re.findall(pattern, \"There are 123 apples\")\n   print(result)  # Output: ['123']\n   ```\n\n2. **Matching Newlines**:\n   ```python\n   import re\n\n   pattern = r\"Line 1\\nLine 2\"  # Matches the exact string \"Line 1\\nLine 2\"\n   text = \"Line 1\\nLine 2\"\n   match = re.match(pattern, text)\n   print(bool(match))  # Output: True\n   ```\n\n3. **Matching Word Characters**:\n   ```python\n   import re\n\n   pattern = r\"\\w+\"  # Matches one or more word characters\n   result = re.findall(pattern, \"Hello, World!\")\n   print(result)  # Output: ['Hello', 'World']\n   ```\n\n4. **Matching Tabs**:\n   ```python\n   import re\n\n   pattern = r\"First\\tSecond\"  # Matches \"First\" followed by a tab and \"Second\"\n   text = \"First\\tSecond\"\n   match = re.match(pattern, text)\n   print(bool(match))  # Output: True\n   ```\n\nUsing raw strings in regex patterns in Python helps avoid the confusion of escaping backslashes, ensuring that your regex patterns are more readable and easier to maintain."
