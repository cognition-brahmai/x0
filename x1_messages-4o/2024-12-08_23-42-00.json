These are: 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\nWe need to find two such prime numbers whose sum is greater than 11, and then determine the smallest possible sum.\n\nLet's calculate the possible sums:\n\n1. \\(2 + 3 = 5\\)\n2. \\(2 + 5 = 7\\)\n3. \\(2 + 7 = 9\\)\n4. \\(3 + 5 = 8\\)\n5. \\(3 + 7 = 10\\)\n6. \\(5 + 7 = 12\\)\n\nFrom these calculations, the smallest sum greater than 11 is 12, which is obtained by adding 5 and 7.\n\nNow, to prove there are no smaller positive integers greater than 11 that can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers between 2 and 10, we review the list of sums:\n\n- The sums 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 are all less than 11.\n- The smallest sum greater than 11 is 12.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer greater than 11 that can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers between 2 and 10 is indeed 12. There are no other possible combinations with these constraints that result in a smaller sum greater than 11."
