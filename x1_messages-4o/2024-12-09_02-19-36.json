The class 'Person' is defined as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom Project.CMFCore.utils import getToolByName\nschema = getattr(Person, 'schema', Schema(())).copy() + Schema((TextField('FirstName', required = True, widget = StringWidget(label='First Name', i18n_domain='project')), TextField('Last Name', required = True, widget = StringWidget(label='Last Name', i18n_domain='i5', label_msgid='label_pub_city'))\nclass Manager(BaseContent):\n  def get_name(self):\n    catalog = getToolByName(self, \"portal_catalog\")\n    people = catalog(portal_type='Person')\n    person={}\n    for object in people:\n      fname = object.firstName\n      lname = object.lastName\n      person['name'] = fname+' '+ lname\n      # if the derived class is Employee then I would like to go to the method 'title' of Employee and if it's a Manager then go to the 'title' method of Manager\n      person['post'] = Employee/Manager.title()\n    return person\n```\n\nThe classes 'Manager' and 'Employee' are defined as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom Project.Person import Person\nclass Manager(Person):\n    def title(self):\n      return \"Manager\"\n```\n\nFor the 'Employee' class, the 'title' is 'Employee'. When I create a 'Person' object, it can be either a 'Manager' or an 'Employee'. However, when I fetch this 'Person' object, the class is 'Person'. I would like to know whether the object is derived from the 'Manager' or 'Employee' class. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To determine whether an object is an instance of a derived class like `Manager` or `Employee`, you can use Python's built-in `isinstance()` function. This function checks if an object is an instance of a specific class or a tuple of classes.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to identify whether a `Person` object is actually a `Manager` or an `Employee`:\n\n1. Ensure that your `Manager` and `Employee` classes inherit from the `Person` class.\n2. Use `isinstance()` to check the type of the object when iterating over the `people` obtained from the catalog.\n\nHere is how you can modify your `get_name()` method:\n\n```python\nclass Manager(Person):\n    def title(self):\n        return \"Manager\"\n\nclass Employee(Person):\n    def title(self):\n        return \"Employee\"\n\nclass Manager(BaseContent):\n    def get_name(self):\n        catalog = getToolByName(self, \"portal_catalog\")\n        people = catalog(portal_type='Person')\n        person = {}\n        \n        for obj in people:\n            fname = obj.firstName\n            lname = obj.lastName\n            person['name'] = fname + ' ' + lname\n            \n            # Determine if the object is a Manager or Employee\n            if isinstance(obj, Manager):\n                person['post'] = obj.title()\n            elif isinstance(obj, Employee):\n                person['post'] = obj.title()\n            else:\n                person['post'] = \"Unknown\"\n        \n        return person\n```\n\n### Important Considerations:\n- Ensure that you create `Manager` and `Employee` objects properly and that they are stored or retrieved as such in your database or data source.\n- Ensure that your catalog or data source is capable of storing and recognizing the specific derived class types, so when you retrieve them, they are not just seen as `Person`.\n- The above code assumes that your `portal_catalog` correctly returns instances of `Manager` or `Employee` as needed.\n\nThis method uses the `title()` method of the respective class (`Manager` or `Employee`) based on the type of the object. This way, you can handle the logic specific to each derived class appropriately."
