I want to check a condition against the front of the queue before deciding whether or not to pop. The current method I'm using, list(my_deque)[0], seems inefficient and unsatisfactory in terms of performance."

The `collections.deque` object supports indexing, which allows you to access elements without converting it to a list. Here\u2019s how you can peek at the front of a `deque`:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Create a deque\nmy_deque = deque([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n\n# Peek at the front element without popping\nfront_element = my_deque[0]\n\n# Check a condition against the front element\nif front_element == 1:\n    print(\"The front element is 1\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The front element is not 1\")\n```\n\nThis method is efficient because it does not require converting the `deque` into a list, which saves both time and memory. Accessing elements by index is O(1) for `deque`, making it a suitable choice for peeking operations."
