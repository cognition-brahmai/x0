        "content": "Creating an HTML table to display and organize data for multiple students and their respective scores in different subjects is straightforward. Below is a basic example to help you get started. This example assumes you have three students and three subjects, but you can expand it as needed:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Student Scores</title>\n    <style>\n        table {\n            width: 50%;\n            border-collapse: collapse;\n            margin: 20px 0;\n        }\n        th, td {\n            border: 1px solid #ddd;\n            padding: 8px;\n            text-align: center;\n        }\n        th {\n            background-color: #f2f2f2;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h2>Student Scores</h2>\n    <table>\n        <thead>\n            <tr>\n                <th>Student Name</th>\n                <th>Math</th>\n                <th>Science</th>\n                <th>English</th>\n            </tr>\n        </thead>\n        <tbody>\n            <tr>\n                <td>John Doe</td>\n                <td>85</td>\n                <td>78</td>\n                <td>93</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>Jane Smith</td>\n                <td>92</td>\n                <td>88</td>\n                <td>79</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>Emily Johnson</td>\n                <td>89</td>\n                <td>94</td>\n                <td>85</td>\n            </tr>\n        </tbody>\n    </table>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **HTML Structure**: The `<table>` element is used to define the table. Inside it, `<thead>` contains the header row, and `<tbody>` contains the data rows.\n- **Styling**: Basic CSS styles are applied to make the table more readable, including borders, padding, and background colors for headers.\n- **Data**: Each `<tr>` (table row) within `<tbody>` contains `<td>` (table cell) elements for each piece of data.\n\nYou can add more rows for additional students or more columns for additional subjects as needed. Adjust the CSS to fit your desired styling and layout preferences."
