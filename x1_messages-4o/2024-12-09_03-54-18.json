However, I encountered a 'ModuleNotFoundError' saying that there is \"No module named 'tkinter'\". When I tried to install 'tkinter' using pip, it could not find the module. How can I rectify this issue so that I can display the graph?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is related to the backend that Matplotlib is using to display plots. By default, Matplotlib might be using a non-GUI backend like 'agg', which does not support displaying plots in a window. To resolve this on your Ubuntu 18.04 system, you'll need to install the `Tkinter` package, which provides a GUI backend for Matplotlib.\n\nHere's how you can fix this issue:\n\n1. **Install Tkinter**: Since `Tkinter` is part of the standard library, you need to install the system package for it. You can do this using the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install python3-tk\n   ```\n\n2. **Configure Matplotlib to use TkAgg**: After installing `Tkinter`, you can set the backend for Matplotlib to `TkAgg`. You can do this either in your script or by modifying the Matplotlib configuration file.\n\n   - **In your script**: Add these lines before importing `pyplot`:\n\n     ```python\n     import matplotlib\n     matplotlib.use('TkAgg')\n     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n     ```\n\n   - **Modify the Matplotlib configuration file**: Locate the `matplotlibrc` configuration file, which is usually found in `~/.config/matplotlib/`. Open it and change the line that defines `backend` to:\n\n     ```plaintext\n     backend : TkAgg\n     ```\n\n3. **Test your setup**: Now, try running a simple plotting script to see if it works:\n\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n   plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4])\n   plt.ylabel('some numbers')\n   plt.show()\n   ```\n\nIf these steps are followed correctly, you should be able to display plots using Matplotlib in PyCharm on your Ubuntu 18.04 system. If you still face issues, ensure that your Python environment in PyCharm is correctly set to use the Python interpreter where `Tkinter` is installed."
