This tells `pip` to install the specified package without installing any of its dependencies. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```bash\npip install --no-deps package_name\n```\n\nReplace `package_name` with the name of the package you want to install. Keep in mind that this approach can lead to runtime errors if the package requires certain dependencies to function correctly. You'll need to ensure that any necessary dependencies are already installed or handle the missing dependencies in your code."
