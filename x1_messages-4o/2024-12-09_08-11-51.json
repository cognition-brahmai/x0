        "content": "I am trying to understand the y-axis in seaborn's distplot. When I use the distplot function with geometrically distributed data and set kde=False, norm_hist=True, and bins=100, I notice that the bin heights don't add up to 1. This suggests that the y-axis doesn't represent probability. I've also noticed the same issue when using a simple list with three bins. In both cases, the sum of the bin heights is greater than 1. However, when I use the plt.hist function with weight parameters, the y-axis appears to represent probability as the bin heights add up to 1. Can someone explain what the y-axis represents in seaborn's distplot when norm_hist=True is used?"

        "content": "When you use Seaborn's `distplot` with the parameter `norm_hist=True`, it normalizes the histogram such that the area under the histogram integrates to 1. This means the bin heights are scaled by the total number of observations and the bin width, not merely adding up to 1.\n\nHere's why the bin heights might not add up to 1:\n\n1. **Normalization by Area, Not Height**: When you set `norm_hist=True`, the histogram is normalized such that the area (not the sum of the heights) is equal to 1. This is achieved by dividing the count in each bin by the total number of observations and the width of the bins.\n\n2. **Bin Width**: The width of each bin plays a role in how the heights are calculated. The y-axis values represent \"density,\" which is the probability density function (PDF) for continuous data. This means the integral (or the area under the curve) of the histogram equals 1.\n\n3. **Discrete vs. Continuous Data**: When dealing with geometrically distributed data (or any discrete distribution), the concept of a PDF doesn't strictly apply in the same way as for continuous data. Hence, the normalization can behave differently compared to continuous distributions.\n\nIn contrast, when using `plt.hist` with the `weights` parameter, you have more direct control over how the heights are calculated, which allows you to ensure they sum to 1 if you're explicitly setting the weights to represent probabilities.\n\nIf you want a histogram where the sum of the heights equals 1 (which represents a probability mass function), you might need to manually calculate and set the weights for each bin accordingly. For most purposes, the normalization by area (PDF style) is the standard approach for visualizing continuous distributions."
