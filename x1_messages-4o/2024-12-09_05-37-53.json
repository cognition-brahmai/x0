        "content": "In Python, while there isn't a built-in decorator specifically for marking functions or methods as deprecated, there are several reasons why this might be the case:\n\n1. **Flexibility**: Deprecation can mean different things in different contexts. By not providing a built-in decorator, Python allows developers to implement deprecation in a way that best suits their needs, whether that's logging a warning, raising an exception, or simply documenting the deprecation.\n\n2. **Simplicity**: Python's philosophy often emphasizes simplicity and minimalism. Adding a deprecation decorator to the standard library might be seen as unnecessary bloat, especially since it's relatively easy to implement using the existing `warnings` module.\n\n3. **Community Solutions**: There are well-regarded third-party solutions, like the `deprecated` package, which provide robust and flexible deprecation decorators. The existence of these packages reduces the need for a built-in solution.\n\nDespite the lack of a dedicated deprecation decorator, Python does include a few standard decorators in its standard library, such as:\n\n- **`@property`**: Used to define a method as a property, which can be accessed like an attribute.\n- **`@staticmethod`**: Used to define a static method within a class.\n- **`@classmethod`**: Used to define a method that's bound to the class and not the instance.\n- **`@functools.lru_cache`**: Used to cache the results of expensive function calls.\n- **`@functools.wraps`**: Used to preserve the original function's metadata when writing custom decorators.\n\nThese decorators cover a wide range of functionality and demonstrate Python's approach to providing useful, general-purpose tools within the standard library. If you need a deprecation decorator, using the `warnings` module in combination with a custom decorator function is a common and effective approach. Here's a simple example:\n\n```python\nimport warnings\nimport functools\n\ndef deprecated(func):\n    @functools.wraps(func)\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        warnings.warn(\n            f\"{func.__name__} is deprecated\",\n            category=DeprecationWarning,\n            stacklevel=2\n        )\n        return func(*args, **kwargs)\n    return wrapper\n\n# Usage\n@deprecated\ndef old_function():\n    print(\"This function is deprecated.\")\n\nold_function()\n```\n\nThis custom decorator will emit a `DeprecationWarning` whenever the decorated function is called, alerting users of the deprecation."
