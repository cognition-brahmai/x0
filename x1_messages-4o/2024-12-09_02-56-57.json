        "content": "The issue you're encountering with the legend displaying two stars instead of one is likely due to matplotlib's default behavior in handling plot markers and labels. When you plot a single point and add a label, matplotlib may interpret it as needing multiple entries in the legend.\n\nTo address this issue, you can use a `Line2D` object to customize the legend entry. Here's how you can modify your code to ensure that only one star is displayed in the legend:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib.lines import Line2D\n\n# Plot the point\nx = 10\ny = 100\nplt.plot(x, y, \"k*\", label=\"Global Optimum\")\n\n# Create a custom legend\nlegend_element = [Line2D([0], [0], marker='*', color='k', label='Global Optimum', markersize=10, linestyle='None')]\nplt.legend(handles=legend_element)\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this revised code, a `Line2D` object is created for the legend with the desired marker and label. The `handles` parameter in `plt.legend()` is used to specify this custom legend entry, ensuring that it appears as expected with only one star."
