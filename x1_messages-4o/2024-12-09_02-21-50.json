I am trying to set a new environment variable 'FAKE' with the path 'C:\\\\' using the os module in Python. However, when I open a new instance and try to retrieve 'FAKE' using os.environ['FAKE'], it returns a KeyError. I need a solution that works across multiple platforms as the tools like Maya at my workplace depend heavily on environment variables to configure paths. I am also considering using the Windows Registry technique and writing alternative methods to call shell scripts on other platforms as needed. Here is my code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['FAKE'] = 'C:\\\\'\n```"

        "content": "To make changes to environment variables persist across different sessions and platforms, you'll need to modify the system's environment settings rather than just the current process's environment, which is what `os.environ` affects. Below are some methods for doing this across different operating systems:\n\n### Windows\n\nOn Windows, you can use the Windows Registry to set environment variables permanently:\n\n1. **Using `setx` Command:**\n\n   You can use the `setx` command from the command line to set environment variables permanently:\n\n   ```python\n   import subprocess\n\n   subprocess.run(['setx', 'FAKE', 'C:\\\\'])\n   ```\n\n   This will set the environment variable for the user session permanently.\n\n2. **Using `winreg` Module:**\n\n   You can also directly modify the Windows Registry using Python:\n\n   ```python\n   import winreg as reg\n\n   def set_env_var(name, value):\n       reg_key = reg.OpenKey(reg.HKEY_CURRENT_USER, 'Environment', 0, reg.KEY_SET_VALUE)\n       reg.SetValueEx(reg_key, name, 0, reg.REG_SZ, value)\n       reg.CloseKey(reg_key)\n\n   set_env_var('FAKE', 'C:\\\\')\n   ```\n\n   After setting the registry, you may need to restart your system or log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.\n\n### macOS and Linux\n\nFor Unix-like systems such as macOS and Linux, you typically set environment variables in shell configuration files like `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, or `.profile`:\n\n1. **Modifying Shell Configuration Files:**\n\n   You can append the export command to one of these files to set the environment variable permanently:\n\n   ```python\n   home = os.path.expanduser('~')\n   bashrc_path = os.path.join(home, '.bashrc')\n\n   with open(bashrc_path, 'a') as file:\n       file.write('\\nexport FAKE=C:\\\\\\n')\n   ```\n\n   Make sure to reload the shell or source the file:\n\n   ```sh\n   source ~/.bashrc\n   ```\n\n2. **Using `os.system`:**\n\n   If you prefer using a script, you can execute shell commands:\n\n   ```python\n   os.system(\"echo 'export FAKE=C:\\\\' >> ~/.bashrc\")\n   os.system(\"source ~/.bashrc\")\n   ```\n\n### Cross-Platform Considerations\n\n- **Platform Check:** You can check the OS and set the variable accordingly:\n\n  ```python\n  import os\n  import platform\n\n  if platform.system() == 'Windows':\n      subprocess.run(['setx', 'FAKE', 'C:\\\\'])\n  else:\n      bashrc_path = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), '.bashrc')\n      with open(bashrc_path, 'a') as file:\n          file.write('\\nexport FAKE=C:\\\\\\n')\n      os.system(\"source ~/.bashrc\")\n  ```\n\n- **Permissions:** Make sure you have the necessary permissions to modify system configurations and that your script runs with sufficient privileges.\n\nBy using these methods, you can set environment variables in a way that they persist across different sessions and are accessible by other applications and tools."
