How can I sort these lists such that the first elements are sorted in descending order, while the second elements in each list are sorted in ascending order? I have tried using 'itemgetter' and setting reverse on the first element, but then when I sort the second element, it disrupts the previous sort. I am unable to use a combined key because I need to first sort in descending order and then in ascending order."

        "content": "To achieve the sorting you want, you can sort the list of lists using a custom sorting function with the `sorted()` function in Python. Since you want the first elements to be sorted in descending order and the second elements to be sorted in ascending order, you can use a lambda function to define the sorting key. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndata = [['a',1], ['a',2], ['a',3], ['b',1], ['b',2], ['b',3]]\n\n# Sort the list with a custom key\nsorted_data = sorted(data, key=lambda x: (-ord(x[0]), x[1]))\n\nprint(sorted_data)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The key function `lambda x: (-ord(x[0]), x[1])` does the following:\n  - `-ord(x[0])`: This sorts the first element in descending order by converting the character to its ASCII value using `ord()` and negating it. This ensures that characters with higher ASCII values are prioritized first.\n  - `x[1]`: This sorts the second element in ascending order.\n\nThis approach ensures that your list of lists is sorted according to your requirements: first by the first element in descending order, and then by the second element in ascending order within each group defined by the first element."
