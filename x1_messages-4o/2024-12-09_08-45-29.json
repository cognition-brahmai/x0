Considering django-piston has 145 forks, 125 open issues, and the last release was almost 2 years ago, it seems to be nearing abandonment. As I'm working on a project that is expected to be significant, I'm looking for a framework that will be maintained for a long time. Is there a consensus in the Python/Django community regarding a preferred framework for REST API services, even if it's one of the 145 forks of django-piston? Also, it would be ideal if this alternative aligns well with @jacobian's REST Worst Practices."

        "content": "Given the situation with django-piston, it's understandable that you are looking for a more actively maintained and widely used alternative for building RESTful APIs in Django. As of my last update in October 2023, the Django community generally favors a few well-maintained and robust frameworks for REST API development. Here are some of the most popular alternatives:\n\n1. **Django REST Framework (DRF):** \n   - **Popularity and Maintenance:** DRF is by far the most popular framework for building REST APIs in Django. It is very well-maintained, with a large community of contributors and frequent updates.\n   - **Features:** DRF offers a rich set of features including authentication, serialization, and view sets, and it integrates seamlessly with Django's ORM.\n   - **Community and Support:** Due to its popularity, there's a wealth of tutorials, documentation, and community support available.\n   - **Alignment with Best Practices:** While DRF is flexible, you can follow best practices outlined by experts like Jacob Kaplan-Moss by carefully configuring your API and following DRF's guidelines on RESTful design.\n\n2. **Tastypie:**\n   - **Popularity:** Tastypie was one of the early players in the Django REST API space but has seen less activity compared to DRF.\n   - **Features:** It provides a lot of similar features to DRF, like serialization and authentication.\n   - **Maintenance:** While not as active as DRF, it still has a user base and contributors.\n\n3. **GraphQL with Graphene-Django:**\n   - **Alternative Approach:** If you're open to exploring GraphQL instead of REST, Graphene-Django is a solid choice. It allows for flexible and efficient data fetching.\n   - **Popularity:** GraphQL is gaining popularity for APIs due to its capability to minimize over-fetching and under-fetching data.\n\n4. **FastAPI (for asynchronous APIs):**\n   - **Popularity and Performance:** If you are considering non-Django options, FastAPI is a modern, high-performance framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.\n   - **Features:** It's known for its speed and ease of use, and it can be a good choice if your project can be structured outside the typical Django ecosystem.\n\nFor your project, especially if you are adhering to REST best practices, Django REST Framework would likely be the most suitable choice. It is reliable, has a vibrant community, and aligns well with how RESTful APIs are commonly structured. Always ensure to evaluate the framework's documentation, community activity, and feature set to ensure it aligns with your project's specific needs."
