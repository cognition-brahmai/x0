This is more elegant and robust compared to checking against a tuple of types using the `in` keyword. \n\nHere's how you can use `isinstance()` to check if a variable is an instance of any of the specified built-in types:\n\n```python\nif isinstance(myvar, (str, int, float, bool, list, dict)):\n    # do something\n```\n\nIn this code, `isinstance()` takes two arguments: the variable you want to check (`myvar`), and a tuple containing the types you want to check against (`(str, int, float, bool, list, dict)`). If `myvar` is an instance of any of these types, `isinstance()` returns `True`, and you can proceed with the corresponding action. This approach is both concise and efficient."
