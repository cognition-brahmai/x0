It appears to be possible using the %f specifier according to the Python documentation. However, when I run the following code in Python 2.6.5 on Ubuntu:\n\n```python\nimport time\nfrom time import strftime\n\nprint strftime(\"%H:%M:%S.%f\")\n```\n\nInstead of getting the time in microseconds, %f just prints as %f. I was under the impression that %f is supported in Python 2.6 and above. What could be the reason for this?"

        "content": "In Python 2.6.5, `%f` is not supported in the `strftime()` function for formatting the time with microsecond precision. The `%f` specifier was introduced in Python 3.6. Unfortunately, Python 2.x versions do not support this feature. \n\nFor Python 2.x, you'll need an alternative approach to obtain microsecond precision. You can use the `datetime` module, which provides better support for handling date and time at a more granular level. Here's an example of how you can achieve this using `datetime`:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Get the current time with microsecond precision\nnow = datetime.now()\n\n# Format the time with microseconds\nformatted_time = now.strftime(\"%H:%M:%S.%f\")\n\nprint(formatted_time)\n```\n\nThis code uses `datetime.now()` to get the current time including microseconds, and then formats it using `strftime()` with `%f` to include microsecond precision. This should work in Python 2.6 and later versions."
