I have my own OpenSSL installation in a non-standard location (/my/path) and I want Python 3.4 to build against that when I compile it from the source. I tried using CPPFLAGS with my directories, and also tried with C_INCLUDE_PATH and colon-separated paths. However, I'm encountering an error related to undefined symbol: SSL_get0_next_proto_negotiated when I run make, even though that is definitely defined. Could you provide some guidance on what I might be doing wrong?"

        "content": "Compiling Python 3.4 with a custom OpenSSL installation can be tricky, especially when dealing with non-standard paths. The `undefined symbol: SSL_get0_next_proto_negotiated` error suggests a mismatch between the OpenSSL version Python is trying to use and the one you have installed. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Compatibility**: First, verify that your OpenSSL version supports the function `SSL_get0_next_proto_negotiated`. This function is available in OpenSSL 1.0.1 and later, so make sure your OpenSSL version is up-to-date.\n\n2. **Set Environment Variables**:\n   - Before configuring Python, set the appropriate environment variables to point to your custom OpenSSL installation. You can do this by setting `LDFLAGS`, `CFLAGS`, and `CPPFLAGS` to include the paths to your OpenSSL libraries and headers.\n   \n   ```bash\n   export LDFLAGS=\"-L/my/path/lib\"\n   export CFLAGS=\"-I/my/path/include\"\n   export CPPFLAGS=\"-I/my/path/include\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Configure Python Build**:\n   - Run the `./configure` script with the `--with-openssl` option pointing to your custom OpenSSL directory. This ensures the build process uses your specified OpenSSL version.\n   \n   ```bash\n   ./configure --with-openssl=/my/path\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify the Correct Library is Linked**:\n   - After running `./configure`, check the generated `Makefile` to ensure that the `LDFLAGS` and `CFLAGS` include your custom paths.\n   - You can also run `ldd` on any existing Python binary to see which OpenSSL library it links against, ensuring it points to your custom installation.\n\n5. **Clean Build**:\n   - If you've attempted a build before, it's a good idea to clean up any previous attempts to avoid any residual configuration issues.\n   \n   ```bash\n   make clean\n   ```\n\n6. **Compile and Install**:\n   - Run `make` and `make install` to compile and install Python.\n   \n   ```bash\n   make\n   make install\n   ```\n\n7. **Test Your Installation**:\n   - After installation, test the Python build to ensure it correctly links against your custom OpenSSL library. You can do this by running a simple script that uses SSL features or by using `ldd` on the newly built Python binary.\n\n8. **Troubleshooting**:\n   - If the issue persists, double-check that there are no conflicting OpenSSL versions on your system that might be getting picked up.\n   - Review the `config.log` file generated by the `./configure` script for any errors or warnings related to OpenSSL.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to compile Python 3.4 with your custom OpenSSL installation. If you encounter any further issues, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to assist further."
