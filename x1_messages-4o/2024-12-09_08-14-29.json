        "content": "I am having trouble with a Python script that should print a series of prime numbers from one to one hundred. The current code I have written is printing all the odd numbers instead of the prime numbers. Here is the code I wrote:\n\n```python\nfor num in range(1, 101):\n    for i in range(2, num):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            break\n        else:\n            print(num)\n            break\n```\nCan anyone help me figure out what's wrong with this code and how to correct it?"

        "content": "The issue with your code is related to the logic within the inner loop and the placement of the `print` statement. The `else` block inside the inner loop is executed every time the loop does not encounter a `break`, which means it prints the number each time it's not divisible by a number less than it. This results in printing numbers as soon as they are confirmed not divisible by the first number in the range (which is often 2 for odd numbers).\n\nHere's a corrected version of the code that properly identifies and prints prime numbers:\n\n```python\nfor num in range(2, 101):  # Start from 2 since 1 is not a prime number\n    is_prime = True  # Assume the number is prime until proven otherwise\n    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):  # Check divisibility up to the square root of the number\n        if num % i == 0:\n            is_prime = False\n            break\n    if is_prime:\n        print(num)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n\n1. **Range Start**: The outer loop starts from 2 because 1 is not a prime number.\n\n2. **Prime Check Optimization**: The inner loop checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. This optimization reduces the number of checks needed.\n\n3. **`is_prime` Flag**: A boolean flag `is_prime` is used to determine if a number is prime. If a divisor is found, `is_prime` is set to `False`, and the loop breaks.\n\n4. **Printing**: The number is printed only if it is confirmed to be prime, i.e., if `is_prime` remains `True` after the inner loop.\n\nThis should correctly print all the prime numbers between 1 and 100."
