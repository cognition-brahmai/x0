This method will sort your DataFrame in ascending order of the index by default, while maintaining the combination of index and column values intact. Here is how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Creating the DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame([1, 1, 1, 1, 1], index=[100, 29, 234, 1, 150], columns=['A'])\n\n# Sorting the DataFrame by index\nsorted_df = df.sort_index()\n\n# Display the sorted DataFrame\nprint(sorted_df)\n```\n\nAfter executing the above code, your DataFrame will be sorted by the index, and it will look like this:\n\n```\n     A\n1    1\n29   1\n100  1\n150  1\n234  1\n```\n\nThe `sort_index()` method ensures that the relationship between each index and its corresponding value in column 'A' is preserved."
