The customer bought a pen for $1.50, a notebook for $3.99, and a pack of markers for $4.50. The coupon offers a 15% discount on the purchase, but only if the total cost is over $10. Can you write a Java code to handle this? \nNote: If the total cost is less than $10, there will be no discount."

        "content": "Certainly! Below is a Java program that calculates the total cost of a customer's items, applies a 15% discount if the total exceeds $10, and prints out the final amount.\n\n```java\npublic class ShoppingCart {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Prices of individual items\n        double penPrice = 1.50;\n        double notebookPrice = 3.99;\n        double markersPrice = 4.50;\n\n        // Calculate total cost of items\n        double totalCost = penPrice + notebookPrice + markersPrice;\n\n        // Check if total cost is more than $10 to apply discount\n        if (totalCost > 10) {\n            // Apply 15% discount\n            totalCost = totalCost - (totalCost * 0.15);\n        }\n\n        // Print the final total cost\n        System.out.printf(\"The total cost after discount (if applicable) is: $%.2f%n\", totalCost);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Item Prices**: The prices of the pen, notebook, and markers are stored in variables.\n2. **Total Cost**: The total cost of the items is calculated by summing up the individual prices.\n3. **Discount Check**: An `if` statement checks if the total cost is greater than $10. If it is, a 15% discount is applied.\n4. **Final Output**: The final total cost is printed, formatted to two decimal places.\n\nYou can run the above code in any Java environment to see the results."
