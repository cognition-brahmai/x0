        "content": "To modify the given JSON data to include sentiment analysis results for each sentence, you will need to add a new key-value pair for the sentiment score or sentiment label (such as positive, negative, or neutral) to each sentence object.\n\nFor performing sentiment analysis on the sentences, you can use natural language processing (NLP) techniques. In Ruby, you can utilize the `sentimental` gem, which is a simple sentiment analysis library.\n\nHere's how you can modify the JSON data and perform sentiment analysis using Ruby:\n\n1. **Install the Sentimental Gem**: First, you need to install the `sentimental` gem if you haven't already. You can do this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   gem install sentimental\n   ```\n\n2. **Ruby Code for Sentiment Analysis**: Use the following Ruby script to analyze the sentiment of each sentence and modify the JSON data.\n\n   ```ruby\n   require 'json'\n   require 'sentimental'\n\n   # Initialize the Sentimental analyzer\n   Sentimental.load_defaults\n   analyzer = Sentimental.new\n\n   # JSON data\n   json_data = {\n     \"sentences\": [\n       {\n         \"text\": \"I really enjoyed the movie\",\n         \"category\": \"opinion\",\n         \"certainty\": \"high\"\n       },\n       {\n         \"text\": \"The sky is blue\",\n         \"category\": \"fact\",\n         \"certainty\": \"medium\"\n       },\n       {\n         \"text\": \"I think the restaurant was too expensive\",\n         \"category\": \"opinion\",\n         \"certainty\": \"low\"\n       },\n       {\n         \"text\": \"There are 365 days in a year\",\n         \"category\": \"fact\",\n         \"certainty\": \"high\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n\n   # Add sentiment analysis results to each sentence\n   json_data[:sentences].each do |sentence|\n     sentiment_score = analyzer.sentiment(sentence[:text])\n     sentence[:sentiment] = sentiment_score.to_s # Convert sentiment result to string (e.g., :positive, :negative, :neutral)\n   end\n\n   # Output the modified JSON data\n   puts JSON.pretty_generate(json_data)\n   ```\n\n3. **Explanation**:\n   - **Sentimental Initialization**: The `Sentimental` library is initialized and loaded with default settings.\n   - **Sentiment Analysis**: For each sentence in the JSON data, the sentiment is analyzed. The sentiment score is then added to the sentence object.\n   - **Output**: The modified JSON data is printed with the sentiment results.\n\nBy running the above script, you'll get the JSON data with sentiment analysis results included:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sentences\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"I really enjoyed the movie\",\n      \"category\": \"opinion\",\n      \"certainty\": \"high\",\n      \"sentiment\": \"positive\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"The sky is blue\",\n      \"category\": \"fact\",\n      \"certainty\": \"medium\",\n      \"sentiment\": \"neutral\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"I think the restaurant was too expensive\",\n      \"category\": \"opinion\",\n      \"certainty\": \"low\",\n      \"sentiment\": \"negative\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"There are 365 days in a year\",\n      \"category\": \"fact\",\n      \"certainty\": \"high\",\n      \"sentiment\": \"neutral\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThis example illustrates how to perform sentiment analysis using Ruby and modify your JSON data to include sentiment results for each sentence."
