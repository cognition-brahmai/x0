This expression involves using a sigma notation, where the subscript \"i\" is placed below the sigma symbol and \"n\" is placed above it. It is a common tool used in many areas of mathematics and science. Can you provide the Latex code for this expression?"

The mathematical expression for the summation of a sequence of numbers from a starting index \"i\" to an ending index \"n\" using sigma notation is written as:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i}^{n} a_i\n\\]\n\nIn LaTeX, this expression is coded as:\n\n```latex\n\\sum_{i}^{n} a_i\n```\n\nIf you have a specific starting index, say \\( i = 1 \\), it would be written as:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i\n\\]\n\nAnd in LaTeX, this is:\n\n```latex\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i\n```\n\nThis notation is commonly used to denote the summation of a sequence of terms \\( a_i \\), starting from the index \\( i \\) and ending at \\( n \\)."
