I'm aware of the `for: else:` construct but it always triggers after the loop finishes, regardless of whether the list was empty or not, so it doesn't meet my needs. Is there a simpler or more Pythonic way to handle this situation?"

        "content": "Yes, there is a more Pythonic way to handle this situation by combining the check for an empty list and the iteration in a more concise manner. You can use an `if` statement to check if the list is empty right before the loop without the need for an `else` block. Here\u2019s an alternative approach:\n\n```python\nlist = get_list()\n\nif list:\n    for i in list:\n        # Do something with the list\n        pass\nelse:\n    # Do something if the list was empty\n    pass\n```\n\nThis is similar to what you have, but more Pythonic would be to avoid using `list` as a variable name because it shadows the built-in `list` type. Here\u2019s a revised version:\n\n```python\nmy_list = get_list()\n\nif my_list:\n    for item in my_list:\n        # Do something with the list\n        pass\nelse:\n    # Do something if the list was empty\n    pass\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you want to keep your code more concise, you can handle the logic directly within the loop using an early return or break:\n\n```python\nmy_list = get_list()\n\nif not my_list:\n    # Do something if the list was empty\n    pass\nelse:\n    for item in my_list:\n        # Do something with the list\n        pass\n```\n\nThis keeps the check for an empty list separate from the loop itself, which can sometimes make the code easier to read and maintain."
