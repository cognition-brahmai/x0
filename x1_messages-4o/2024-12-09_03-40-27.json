However, I have noticed that this method is no longer available in Python 3. I'm aware of the _thread module, but from what I understand, it's not recommended to use _thread. Is there an alternative method similar to thread.start_new_thread in Python 3 that is considered good practice to use?"

        "content": "In Python 3, the `thread` module has been renamed to `_thread`, and while you can still use `_thread.start_new_thread()`, the recommended approach is to use the `threading` module, which provides a higher-level interface for working with threads. The `threading` module makes it easier to manage threads and is considered more robust and reliable.\n\nHere's how you can use the `threading` module to achieve similar functionality to `thread.start_new_thread` without having to define a separate class:\n\n```python\nimport threading\n\ndef my_function(arg1, arg2):\n    print(f\"Arguments received: {arg1}, {arg2}\")\n\n# Create a new thread\nthread = threading.Thread(target=my_function, args=(5, 10))\n\n# Start the thread\nthread.start()\n\n# Optionally, wait for the thread to complete\nthread.join()\n```\n\nIn this example, `threading.Thread` is used to create a new thread that will run `my_function` with the specified arguments. By calling `thread.start()`, you start the thread, and `thread.join()` can be used to wait for the thread to finish if needed.\n\nUsing the `threading` module is the recommended way to work with threads in Python 3, as it provides additional features such as thread synchronization, thread-safe queues, and more, which can be very useful in more complex applications."
