        "content": "Certainly! To find the largest sum of consecutive integers in an array, you can use Kadane's Algorithm. This algorithm efficiently computes the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in linear time. Below is a Python program implementing Kadane's Algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef max_subarray_sum(arr):\n    # Initialize variables\n    max_ending_here = arr[0]\n    max_so_far = arr[0]\n    \n    # Iterate through the array starting from the second element\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        # Update max_ending_here to include current element\n        max_ending_here = max(arr[i], max_ending_here + arr[i])\n        # Update max_so_far if max_ending_here is greater\n        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)\n    \n    return max_so_far\n\n# Example usage\narray = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]\nlargest_sum = max_subarray_sum(array)\nprint(\"The largest sum of consecutive integers is:\", largest_sum)\n```\n\n### How it Works:\n1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing two variables, `max_ending_here` and `max_so_far`, with the value of the first element in the array. These variables will keep track of the maximum sum of the subarray ending at the current position and the maximum sum found so far, respectively.\n\n2. **Iteration**: Traverse through the array starting from the second element. For each element:\n   - Update `max_ending_here` by comparing the current element itself and the sum of the current element with `max_ending_here`. This helps in deciding whether to start a new subarray or to continue with the existing one.\n   - Update `max_so_far` if `max_ending_here` is greater, which keeps track of the maximum sum encountered.\n\n3. **Result**: After iterating through the array, `max_so_far` will contain the largest sum of consecutive integers.\n\nThis method efficiently finds the solution in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in the array."
