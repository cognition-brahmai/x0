        "content": "Certainly! Sentence labeling involves categorizing sentences or sentence fragments based on specific criteria. This can be useful in natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, summarization, or text classification. Below, I'll provide detailed information on sentence labeling, criteria for distinguishing fragments from complete sentences, and a JSON data example that includes the average length of the labeled sentences.\n\n### Criteria for Distinguishing Fragments from Complete Sentences\n\n1. **Complete Sentence**:\n   - Contains a subject and a predicate.\n   - Expresses a complete thought.\n   - Ends with proper punctuation (e.g., period, exclamation mark, question mark).\n\n2. **Fragment**:\n   - Lacks a subject, a predicate, or both.\n   - Does not express a complete thought.\n   - Can be a dependent clause or phrase.\n\n### Examples\n\n- **Complete Sentence**: \"The cat sat on the mat.\"\n  - Subject: \"The cat\"\n  - Predicate: \"sat on the mat\"\n  - Expresses a complete thought.\n\n- **Fragment**: \"Sitting on the mat.\"\n  - Lacks a subject.\n  - Does not express a complete thought.\n\n### JSON Data Example\n\nHere is a JSON representation of sentence labeling, including the average length of the labeled sentences.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sentence_data\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"The cat sat on the mat.\",\n      \"type\": \"complete_sentence\",\n      \"length\": 21\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"Sitting on the mat.\",\n      \"type\": \"fragment\",\n      \"length\": 18\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"While the sun was setting.\",\n      \"type\": \"fragment\",\n      \"length\": 25\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"She enjoys playing the piano.\",\n      \"type\": \"complete_sentence\",\n      \"length\": 29\n    }\n  ],\n  \"average_length\": 23.25\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Type**: Indicates whether the text is a \"complete_sentence\" or a \"fragment\".\n- **Length**: Represents the number of characters in the sentence or fragment.\n- **Average Length**: Calculated as the mean length of all labeled sentences or fragments. In this example, the average length is 23.25 characters.\n\nBy analyzing and labeling sentences and fragments, we can better understand and process natural language in various applications. This JSON data structure helps in organizing and analyzing textual data efficiently."
