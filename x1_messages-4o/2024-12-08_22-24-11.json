One dish should be a curry-based dish featuring pork as the main protein, while the other should be a stir-fried noodle dish with a vegetarian protein such as tofu or seitan, served with a side of pickled vegetables and a spicy chili dipping sauce. Additionally, both dishes should adhere to traditional Thai cooking methods, such as pounding fresh herbs and spices using a mortar and pestle, and should be garnished with fresh herbs such as Thai basil and cilantro."
