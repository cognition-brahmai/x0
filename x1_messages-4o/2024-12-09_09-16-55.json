        "content": "To find all the duplicates in an integer array in Java, you can use a `HashSet` to keep track of the elements you have already seen, and then identify duplicates. Below is a sample Java program to achieve this:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.HashSet;\nimport java.util.Set;\n\npublic class FindDuplicates {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 3};\n        \n        Set<Integer> duplicates = findDuplicates(array);\n        \n        System.out.println(\"Duplicates in the array: \" + duplicates);\n    }\n\n    public static Set<Integer> findDuplicates(int[] array) {\n        Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();\n        Set<Integer> duplicates = new HashSet<>();\n        \n        for (int num : array) {\n            if (seen.contains(num)) {\n                duplicates.add(num);\n            } else {\n                seen.add(num);\n            }\n        }\n        \n        return duplicates;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`HashSet`**: We use two `HashSet` instances; one to keep track of the numbers we have already seen (`seen`), and another to collect duplicates (`duplicates`).\n\n2. **Iterate through the array**: For each number in the array, we check if it is already in the `seen` set.\n   \n   - If it is, we add it to the `duplicates` set because it means we've encountered it before.\n   - If it isn't, we add it to the `seen` set.\n\n3. **Output**: Finally, we print out the duplicates.\n\nThis program efficiently finds all duplicates with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, because each element is processed at most twice."
