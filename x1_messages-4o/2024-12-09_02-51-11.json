I've set up my environment using a Docker container and have followed the tutorial's steps up to inputting the command `tensorboard --logdir=data/ --port=8080` into the terminal. After running the command, the terminal outputs `Starting TensorBoard 29 on port 8080 (You can navigate to http://172.17.0.2:8080)`. However, when I try to navigate to `http://172.17.0.2:8080`, I don't see anything and receive a message that the server where this page is located is not responding. Can anyone provide some advice on how to successfully launch TensorBoard?"

        "content": "It sounds like you're encountering a network issue related to how Docker is handling port forwarding. There are a few steps you can take to resolve this:\n\n1. **Check Docker Port Mapping**: Ensure that the port you're using in the Docker container is correctly mapped to your host machine. When you start your Docker container, you should use the `-p` flag to map the container's port to a port on your host machine. For example:\n   ```bash\n   docker run -p 8080:8080 your-docker-image\n   ```\n   This maps port 8080 on the host to port 8080 on the container.\n\n2. **Accessing via Localhost**: Instead of using the IP `172.17.0.2`, try accessing TensorBoard via `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`:\n   ```\n   http://localhost:8080\n   ```\n   This assumes that the port mapping is correctly set up as described in the previous step.\n\n3. **Firewall and Security Groups**: Ensure that your firewall or any network security groups aren't blocking access to port 8080. This is particularly relevant if you're running the setup on a cloud VM.\n\n4. **Docker Network Configuration**: Verify the network settings of your Docker container. It should be on a bridge network that allows communication between your host and the container.\n\n5. **Check TensorBoard Logs**: Check the terminal or any logs for any errors or warnings that might indicate why TensorBoard isn't accessible.\n\n6. **Use a Different Port**: Sometimes other processes might be using port 8080. Try using a different port by modifying the TensorBoard command and the Docker port mapping accordingly:\n   ```bash\n   tensorboard --logdir=data/ --port=6006\n   ```\n   And then map it with Docker:\n   ```bash\n   docker run -p 6006:6006 your-docker-image\n   ```\n\nIf you try these steps and still encounter issues, please provide more details about your Docker setup, and any error messages you see, so I can assist you further."
