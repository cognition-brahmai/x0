Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom enum import Enum\n\nclass Color(Enum):\n    RED = 1\n    BLUE = 2\n\n# Collect the values in a list\ncolor_values = [color.value for color in Color]\n\n# Print the list of values\nprint(color_values)\n```\n\nThis code snippet will produce the output:\n\n```\n[1, 2]\n```\n\nBy iterating over `Color`, you are accessing each member of the enum, and using `.value` gives you the integer value associated with each member."
