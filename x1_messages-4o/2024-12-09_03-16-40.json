For instance, I've been testing the two methods with the following code:\n\n```python\nimport scipy as sp\nimport numpy as np\nsparse_m = sp.sparse.bsr_matrix(np.array([[1,0,0,0,1], [1,0,0,0,1]]))\n\n%timeit sparse_m.toarray()\n1000 loops, best of 3: 299 \u00b5s per loop\n\n%timeit sparse_m.todense()\n1000 loops, best of 3: 305 \u00b5s per loop\n```"

        "content": "When working with sparse matrices in SciPy, you have two methods to convert them into dense formats: `.toarray()` and `.todense()`. Both serve similar purposes but differ in some aspects:\n\n1. **Return Type**:\n   - `.toarray()`: Returns a NumPy `ndarray`. This is often the more commonly used format in general NumPy operations.\n   - `.todense()`: Returns a NumPy `matrix`, which is a subclass of `ndarray` designed specifically for matrix operations, maintaining two-dimensionality.\n\n2. **Usability**:\n   - `.toarray()`: Since it returns a generic `ndarray`, it is more versatile and can be used in the broader context of NumPy operations. If you're planning to use operations that require matrices to remain strictly two-dimensional, you might need to handle reshaping or other operations manually.\n   - `.todense()`: The `matrix` class supports matrix arithmetic where operators like `*` are matrix multiplication by default, unlike element-wise multiplication in `ndarray`. This can be useful if you're specifically dealing with linear algebra operations.\n\n3. **Performance**:\n   - As seen in your timing tests, the performance of both methods is very similar, with any difference typically being negligible. The choice between them should not be based on performance but rather on the desired output format and how you plan to use the resulting dense matrix.\n\n4. **Legacy and Compatibility**:\n   - The NumPy `matrix` class is somewhat legacy and might not be as well-supported in new NumPy functionalities compared to the `ndarray`. Therefore, `.toarray()` is generally recommended for new code unless you specifically need the `matrix` behavior.\n\nIn summary, if you need a plain `ndarray`, use `.toarray()`. If you need the matrix-like behavior for specific linear algebra operations, you might prefer `.todense()`. However, for most modern applications, sticking with `.toarray()` is likely the more future-proof and flexible choice."
