        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the absence of the `_sqlite3` module in your Python installation. This usually happens when Python is compiled without SQLite support. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Install SQLite Development Libraries:**\n   First, ensure that the SQLite development libraries are installed on your system. You need these libraries when compiling Python to enable SQLite support.\n\n   Run the following command to install SQLite development packages:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev\n   ```\n\n2. **Recompile Python:**\n   Since you mentioned using Python 2.5, you'll need to recompile it with SQLite support. Follow these steps:\n\n   - Download the Python source code from the official Python website or a trusted source that hosts older versions.\n   - Extract the source code and navigate to the extracted directory.\n   - Run the following commands to configure, compile, and install Python:\n\n     ```bash\n     ./configure --with-sqlite\n     make\n     sudo make install\n     ```\n\n   Ensure that the `--with-sqlite` flag is specified to include SQLite support during the configuration step.\n\n3. **Verify the Installation:**\n   After recompiling and installing Python, verify that the `_sqlite3` module is now available. You can do this by starting the Python interpreter and importing the `sqlite3` module:\n\n   ```bash\n   python\n   >>> import sqlite3\n   >>> sqlite3.version\n   ```\n\n   If no error is raised and you see the version of SQLite, the installation was successful.\n\n4. **Consider Upgrading:**\n   Python 2.5 is an outdated version, and it's recommended to upgrade to a more recent version of Python, such as Python 3.x. Newer versions offer improved features, security, and performance.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the \"No module named _sqlite3\" error and run your Django application successfully."
