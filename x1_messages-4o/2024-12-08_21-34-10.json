        "content": "To identify stocks with rising dividend yields and reasonable levels of risk using Swift, you'll need to leverage APIs to get financial data. Here's a simplified approach using Swift, assuming you have access to a financial data API (like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or others):\n\n1. **Set up your Swift project**: Make sure you have access to networking capabilities, possibly using `URLSession` or a networking library like `Alamofire`.\n\n2. **Fetch financial data**: You'll need to fetch historical dividend yield data and other financial metrics (like beta for risk assessment) for a list of stocks.\n\n3. **Analyze the data**: Calculate the trend of dividend yields and assess the risk levels.\n\nHere's a conceptual implementation:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nstruct Stock {\n    let symbol: String\n    let dividendYield: Double\n    let beta: Double\n}\n\nfunc fetchStockData(symbol: String, completion: @escaping (Stock?) -> Void) {\n    let urlString = \"https://api.example.com/stock/\\(symbol)\"\n    guard let url = URL(string: urlString) else {\n        completion(nil)\n        return\n    }\n    \n    URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { data, response, error in\n        guard let data = data, error == nil else {\n            completion(nil)\n            return\n        }\n        \n        // Parse JSON data\n        do {\n            if let json = try JSONSerialization.jsonObject(with: data, options: []) as? [String: Any],\n               let dividendYield = json[\"dividendYield\"] as? Double,\n               let beta = json[\"beta\"] as? Double {\n                let stock = Stock(symbol: symbol, dividendYield: dividendYield, beta: beta)\n                completion(stock)\n            } else {\n                completion(nil)\n            }\n        } catch {\n            completion(nil)\n        }\n    }.resume()\n}\n\nfunc evaluateStocks(symbols: [String], completion: @escaping ([Stock]) -> Void) {\n    var evaluatedStocks = [Stock]()\n    let group = DispatchGroup()\n    \n    for symbol in symbols {\n        group.enter()\n        \n        fetchStockData(symbol: symbol) { stock in\n            if let stock = stock {\n                // Evaluate risk and dividend yield criteria\n                if stock.dividendYield > 2.0 && stock.beta < 1.2 { // Example criteria\n                    evaluatedStocks.append(stock)\n                }\n            }\n            group.leave()\n        }\n    }\n    \n    group.notify(queue: .main) {\n        completion(evaluatedStocks)\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage\nlet stockSymbols = [\"AAPL\", \"MSFT\", \"GOOGL\", \"TSLA\"]\nevaluateStocks(symbols: stockSymbols) { stocks in\n    for stock in stocks {\n        print(\"Stock: \\(stock.symbol), Dividend Yield: \\(stock.dividendYield), Beta: \\(stock.beta)\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Stock Struct**: Represents a stock with its symbol, dividend yield, and beta value.\n- **fetchStockData**: Fetches financial data for a specific stock symbol.\n- **evaluateStocks**: Evaluates a list of stock symbols and filters them based on dividend yield and beta (risk level).\n- **Criteria**: Adjust the dividend yield and beta criteria based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.\n\n### Note:\n- Replace `https://api.example.com/stock/\\(symbol)` with the actual API endpoint.\n- Ensure you handle API keys and limits according to the service provider's policies.\n- This example uses simple criteria and is synchronous for simplicity. In a real-world application, consider more complex analysis and asynchronous processing."
