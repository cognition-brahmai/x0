        "content": "I am practicing building and comparing neural networks using Keras and Tensorflow in Python. I have created three models and I have no problem running them, getting predicted probabilities, plotting ROC curves, or plotting PR curves. However, when I try to plot the three curves together using the code `plt.plot(model1.history['val_loss'], 'r', model2.history['val_loss'], 'b', model3.history['val_loss'], 'g')`, I am encountering an error: `TypeError: 'History' object is not subscriptable`. When I access the 'val_loss' from the history object of the model using `model1.history['val_loss']`, I receive the same TypeError. Can someone guide me on what could be causing this error?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the `History` object returned by the `fit` method of a Keras model is not directly subscriptable with keys like `'val_loss'`. Instead, you should access the `history` attribute of the `History` object, which is a dictionary containing the keys for all metrics that were tracked during training, including `'val_loss'`.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to correctly access and plot the validation losses from the history objects of your models:\n\n```python\n# Assume model1, model2, and model3 are your trained models\n\n# Access the 'val_loss' from the history object of each model\nval_loss1 = model1.history.history['val_loss']\nval_loss2 = model2.history.history['val_loss']\nval_loss3 = model3.history.history['val_loss']\n\n# Plot the validation losses for the three models\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nplt.plot(val_loss1, 'r', label='Model 1')\nplt.plot(val_loss2, 'b', label='Model 2')\nplt.plot(val_loss3, 'g', label='Model 3')\n\n# Add labels and legend\nplt.xlabel('Epochs')\nplt.ylabel('Validation Loss')\nplt.title('Validation Loss Comparison')\nplt.legend()\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `model1`, `model2`, and `model3` with the actual variables that hold your trained models. This should resolve the `TypeError` and allow you to plot the validation losses of your models on the same graph."
