Even though it's supposed to check if every item in the iterable evaluates to \"True\", and we know empty lists are evaluated to False. I understand the implementation of the \"all\" function, but I'm confused as to why it doesn't return False for an empty iterable. Is there a logic to this?\n\n<pre><code>\n>>> print all([])\nTrue\n\n>>> bool([])\nFalse\n\n def all(iterable):\n    for element in iterable:\n        if not element:\n            return False\n    return True\n</code></pre>\n\nFor example, \n<pre><code>\ntoday_todo_status = [task.status for task in my_todo if task.date == today]\ncan_i_go_home = all(today_todo_status)\n</code></pre>\nHere, it makes sense if I have no tasks and I can go home. But I don't think \"all\" was made just for todo lists."

        "content": "The behavior of the `all` function in Python, returning `True` for empty iterables, is rooted in mathematical logic, specifically in the concept of vacuous truth. The idea is that a universal statement is considered true if there are no counterexamples. In simpler terms, if you have an empty set of conditions to satisfy, then all conditions are trivially satisfied because there are no conditions that are violated.\n\nHere's a more detailed explanation:\n\n1. **Vacuous Truth**: In logic, a statement like \"all elements of a set have property P\" is considered to be true if there are no elements in the set. This is because there are no elements that can contradict the statement.\n\n2. **Logical Consistency**: This behavior is consistent with other Python functions and operations. For instance, `any([])` returns `False` because there are no elements that can satisfy the condition of being `True`.\n\n3. **Practical Implications**: This approach is practical in many scenarios, such as in loops and conditional checks. For example, when checking if all tasks are completed (in your todo list example), if there are no tasks, it makes sense to consider that all tasks are done.\n\n4. **Comparison with Mathematical Logic**: In mathematics, the universal quantification over an empty set is always true. This principle ensures that functions like `all` align with established logical principles.\n\nIn summary, the design choice for `all([])` to return `True` is grounded in logical reasoning and ensures consistency across Python's handling of iterables. It might seem counterintuitive at first, but when considered from a logical perspective, it aligns well with mathematical conventions and practical use cases."
