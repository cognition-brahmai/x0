I've tried using `nx.disjoint_union(G,H)` but it changes the node labels of H rather than joining the graphs at the nodes with the same number. For example:\n\nHere are my two networkx graphs, G and H:\n\n```python\nG=nx.Graph()\nfromnodes=[0,1,1,1,1,1,2]\ntonodes=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]\nfor x,y in zip(fromnodes,tonodes):\n    G.add_edge(x,y)\n\nH=nx.Graph()\nfromnodes=range(2,8)\ntonodes=range(8,14)\nfor x,y in zip(fromnodes,tonodes):\n    H.add_edge(x,y)\n```\nWhen I use `nx.disjoint_union(G,H)`, the node labels for H are changed:\n\n```python\n>>> G.nodes()\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n>>> H.nodes()\n[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]\n>>> Un= nx.disjoint_union(G,H)\n>>> Un.nodes()\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]\n```\n\nWhat's the best way to join these graphs while preserving the node names?"

        "content": "To combine two NetworkX graphs while preserving the node names, you should use the `nx.compose()` function. This function combines two graphs by taking the union of their sets of nodes and edges. If there are any nodes with the same name in both graphs, they will be merged rather than renamed.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\n# Define graph G\nG = nx.Graph()\nfromnodes = [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]\ntonodes = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\nfor x, y in zip(fromnodes, tonodes):\n    G.add_edge(x, y)\n\n# Define graph H\nH = nx.Graph()\nfromnodes = range(2, 8)\ntonodes = range(8, 14)\nfor x, y in zip(fromnodes, tonodes):\n    H.add_edge(x, y)\n\n# Combine the graphs using compose\ncombined_graph = nx.compose(G, H)\n\n# Print the nodes and edges of the combined graph\nprint(\"Nodes in combined graph:\", combined_graph.nodes())\nprint(\"Edges in combined graph:\", combined_graph.edges())\n```\n\nThis will give you a combined graph where the node names are preserved and any common nodes between the two graphs will be merged. Here, nodes 2 through 7 are common to both graphs, so they will be merged in the combined graph."
