The error message I receive is \"Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement <package-name> (from versions: ). No matching distribution found for <package-name>\". I've checked similar questions on Stack Overflow, but they don't seem to apply to my situation. Additionally, I've checked to see if PyPI is down or my IP is blacklisted, but these don't seem to be the issue. When running 'pip install --upgrade pip', pip is shown as up-to-date. Why is this happening and how can I resolve this?"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering typically indicates that `pip` is unable to find a compatible version of the package you're trying to install. Here are several steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Python Version Compatibility:**\n   - Ensure that the package you're trying to install is compatible with your version of Python. Some packages may not support older or newer versions of Python.\n\n2. **Specify Package Version:**\n   - If you know a specific version of the package that should work, try specifying the version. For example:\n     ```\n     pip install <package-name>==<version>\n     ```\n\n3. **Check PyPI Index:**\n   - Make sure you're pointing to the correct PyPI index. Sometimes custom configurations or mirrors might not have the package. You can specify the default PyPI index explicitly:\n     ```\n     pip install <package-name> --index-url https://pypi.org/simple\n     ```\n\n4. **Check Virtual Environment:**\n   - If you're using a virtual environment, ensure that it's activated. Sometimes packages are not found due to incorrect environment contexts.\n\n5. **Network Issues:**\n   - Check if there are any network restrictions, proxies, or firewalls that might be blocking access to PyPI. You can try setting up a proxy if necessary:\n     ```\n     pip install <package-name> --proxy http://your-proxy:port\n     ```\n\n6. **Upgrade `pip`, `setuptools`, and `wheel`:**\n   - Sometimes upgrading these tools can resolve compatibility issues:\n     ```\n     pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel\n     ```\n\n7. **Check for Typos:**\n   - Double-check the package name for typos. Even a small mistake can lead to this error.\n\n8. **Look for Package Availability:**\n   - Verify that the package actually exists on PyPI and is not deprecated or removed. You can search for the package on [PyPI's website](https://pypi.org).\n\n9. **Use Verbose Mode:**\n   - Running `pip` in verbose mode can provide more detailed information about what's going wrong:\n     ```\n     pip install <package-name> --verbose\n     ```\n\n10. **Check Compatibility with OS:**\n    - Some packages have dependencies that are not available for all operating systems. Check if the package supports your OS.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue preventing the package installation. If the problem persists, consider reaching out to the package maintainers or checking the package's repository for additional support."
