        "content": "To install TensorFlow 2.0.0-alpha0 in a conda environment using Python 3.7, you might need to take a slightly different approach since the version you are looking for might not be directly available through the default conda channels. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get it set up:\n\n1. **Create a new conda environment**:\n   It's a good practice to create a new environment specifically for TensorFlow to avoid any potential conflicts with other packages.\n\n   ```bash\n   conda create -n tf2-alpha python=3.7\n   ```\n\n2. **Activate the environment**:\n   Once the environment is created, activate it:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda activate tf2-alpha\n   ```\n\n3. **Install TensorFlow using pip**:\n   The version you are looking for might be available through pip rather than conda. You can install it using pip within your conda environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install tensorflow==2.0.0-alpha0\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify the installation**:\n   Check if TensorFlow is installed correctly by running Python and importing TensorFlow:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -c \"import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)\"\n   ```\n\n   This should output `2.0.0-alpha0` if everything was installed correctly.\n\n5. **Additional steps**:\n   If you encounter any issues, make sure your pip is up to date:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade pip\n   ```\n\n   Also, ensure that you have the necessary system dependencies installed on Fedora, which might include development tools and libraries.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to install TensorFlow 2.0.0-alpha0 in your conda environment with Python 3.7 on Fedora 29. There is no need to downgrade to Python 3.6, as TensorFlow 2.0.0-alpha0 is compatible with Python 3.7."
