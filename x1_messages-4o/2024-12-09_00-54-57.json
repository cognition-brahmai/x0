        "content": "Certainly! The error message you're encountering typically means that the Python executable is not in your system's PATH environment variable. Here\u2019s how you can resolve this issue:\n\n### Step 1: Locate the Python Installation Path\nFirst, you need to find out where Python is installed on your computer. You can do this by navigating to the directories where Python 2.7 and Python 3.2 are installed. Typically, they might be in a path like `C:\\Python27` for Python 2.7 and `C:\\Python32` for Python 3.2, but this can vary based on how you installed Python.\n\n### Step 2: Add Python to the System PATH\n\n#### For Windows:\n1. **Open Environment Variables:**\n   - Right-click on \"This PC\" or \"My Computer\" on your desktop or in File Explorer.\n   - Click on \"Properties\".\n   - Click on \"Advanced system settings\" on the left-hand side.\n   - In the System Properties window, click on the \"Environment Variables\" button.\n\n2. **Edit the PATH Variable:**\n   - In the Environment Variables window, under \"System variables\", scroll down and select the \"Path\" variable, then click \"Edit\".\n   - In the Edit Environment Variable window, click \"New\" and add the path to your Python installation, e.g., `C:\\Python27` and `C:\\Python32`.\n   - Also, add the path to the Scripts directory if it exists, e.g., `C:\\Python27\\Scripts` and `C:\\Python32\\Scripts`.\n\n3. **Apply the Changes:**\n   - Click \"OK\" to close all the windows.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the Installation\n- Open a new command prompt window (important to open a new one to refresh the environment variables).\n- Type `python --version` to check if Python 2.7 is recognized.\n- Type `python3 --version` to check if Python 3.2 is recognized, if you are using the `python3` command for Python 3.x.\n\n### Step 4: Set Default Python Version (Optional)\nIf you have both versions installed and want to use a specific version as the default when you type `python`, you can rename the executables:\n- Navigate to the Python installation directory.\n- Rename `python.exe` to `python2.exe` in the Python 2.7 directory.\n- Rename `python.exe` to `python3.exe` in the Python 3.2 directory.\n- Now, you can call `python2` or `python3` from the command line to specify which version you want to use.\n\n### Step 5: Alternative (Using Python Launcher)\n- If you installed the Python launcher for Windows, you can use `py` command in the terminal to execute Python scripts. It automatically uses the appropriate version of Python based on the shebang line in your script or command-line options.\n\nThese steps should resolve the issue and allow you to use Python from the command line.
