        "content": "Absolutely, I'm ready to help with that. Let's start with the given dictionary and then modify the Python code to compute the average grade of students below 15 years old.\n\nSuppose you have a dictionary like this:\n\n```python\nstudents = {\n    'student1': {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 14, 'grade': 85},\n    'student2': {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 15, 'grade': 78},\n    'student3': {'name': 'Charlie', 'age': 13, 'grade': 92},\n    'student4': {'name': 'David', 'age': 16, 'grade': 88},\n    'student5': {'name': 'Eve', 'age': 14, 'grade': 95}\n}\n```\n\nLet's write a function to compute the average grade of students who are below 15 years old:\n\n```python\ndef average_grade_under_15(students):\n    total_grade = 0\n    count = 0\n    for student_id, student_info in students.items():\n        if student_info['age'] < 15:\n            total_grade += student_info['grade']\n            count += 1\n    if count == 0:\n        return 0  # Avoid division by zero if no students are under 15\n    return total_grade / count\n\naverage_grade = average_grade_under_15(students)\nprint(\"The average grade of students below 15 years old is:\", average_grade)\n```\n\nHere's how the code works:\n1. Initialize `total_grade` and `count` to 0.\n2. Iterate through each student in the dictionary.\n3. Check if the student's age is less than 15.\n4. If it is, add the student's grade to `total_grade` and increment the `count`.\n5. After iterating through all students, check if `count` is zero to avoid division by zero.\n6. Return the average grade by dividing `total_grade` by `count`.\n\nThis code will give you the average grade of students who are under 15 years old."
