I have a view named 'detail' which currently displays details of a venue. Now, I want to modify this view to display all the events that are happening at a particular venue. How can I achieve this?\n\nHere are my models:\n\n```python\nclass Event(models.Model):\n    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)\n    date_published = models.DateTimeField('published date',default=datetime.now, blank=True)\n    date_start = models.DateTimeField('start date')\n    date_end = models.DateTimeField('end date')\n    def __unicode__(self):\n        return self.title\n    description = models.TextField()\n    price = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)\n    venue = models.ForeignKey(Venue)\n\nclass Venue(models.Model):\n    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)\n    date_published = models.DateTimeField('published date',default=datetime.now, blank=True)\n    venue_latitude = models.CharField(max_length=200)\n    venue_longitude = models.CharField(max_length=200)\n    venue_address = models.CharField(max_length=200)\n    venue_city = models.CharField(max_length=200)\n    venue_state = models.CharField(max_length=200)\n    venue_country = models.CharField(max_length=200)\n    description = models.TextField()\n    def __unicode__(self):\n        return u'%s' % (self.title)\n```\n\nAnd this is my current view:\n\n```python\ndef detail(request, venue_id):\n    venue = get_object_or_404(Venue, pk=venue_id)\n    return render(request, 'venue-detail.html', {'venue': venue})\n```"

        "content": "To modify your `detail` view to display all the events happening at a particular venue, you'll need to query the `Event` model to retrieve events that are associated with the venue being displayed. You can achieve this by using the reverse relationship provided by Django.\n\nHere's how you can update your `detail` view:\n\n```python\nfrom django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404, render\nfrom .models import Venue, Event\n\ndef detail(request, venue_id):\n    venue = get_object_or_404(Venue, pk=venue_id)\n    events = Event.objects.filter(venue=venue)  # Fetch all events for this venue\n    return render(request, 'venue-detail.html', {'venue': venue, 'events': events})\n```\n\nIn this updated view:\n\n- You're retrieving all `Event` objects that have a foreign key pointing to the current `Venue` instance using `Event.objects.filter(venue=venue)`.\n- You're passing both the `venue` and the list of `events` to the template context, so you can access them in your template.\n\nNow, in your `venue-detail.html` template, you can loop over the `events` context variable to display the events related to the venue:\n\n```html\n<h1>{{ venue.title }}</h1>\n<p>{{ venue.description }}</p>\n<p>Address: {{ venue.venue_address }}, {{ venue.venue_city }}, {{ venue.venue_state }}, {{ venue.venue_country }}</p>\n\n<h2>Events Happening at {{ venue.title }}</h2>\n<ul>\n  {% for event in events %}\n    <li>\n      <h3>{{ event.title }}</h3>\n      <p>{{ event.description }}</p>\n      <p>Start: {{ event.date_start }}</p>\n      <p>End: {{ event.date_end }}</p>\n      <p>Price: {{ event.price }}</p>\n    </li>\n  {% empty %}\n    <li>No events scheduled at this venue.</li>\n  {% endfor %}\n</ul>\n```\n\nThis template will display each event's title, description, start and end dates, and price. If no events are found for the venue, it will display a message indicating that no events are scheduled."
