According to the documentation, I should be able to use the write.parquet function to create the file. However, when I run my script, I encounter an AttributeError that states: 'RDD' object has no attribute 'write'. How can I resolve this issue? Here is the code I am trying to run:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark import SparkContext\nsc = SparkContext(\"local\", \"Protob Conversion to Parquet \")\n\n# spark is an existing SparkSession\ndf = sc.textFile(\"/temp/proto_temp.csv\")\n\n# Displays the content of the DataFrame to stdout\ndf.write.parquet(\"/output/proto.parquet\")\n```\n\nI am currently using Spark version 2.0.1 built for Hadoop 2.7.3."

        "content": "The error you're encountering indicates that you're trying to use DataFrame operations on an RDD. In PySpark, the `textFile` method of `SparkContext` returns an RDD, not a DataFrame. To write to a Parquet file using the `write.parquet` method, you need to work with a DataFrame. Here's how you can modify your code to convert the RDD into a DataFrame and then write it as a Parquet file:\n\n1. Create a SparkSession instead of a SparkContext, which will allow you to work with DataFrames.\n2. Use `SparkSession.read` methods to read data into a DataFrame.\n3. Write the DataFrame to a Parquet file.\n\nHere's the updated code:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\n# Initialize SparkSession\nspark = SparkSession.builder \\\n    .appName(\"Protob Conversion to Parquet\") \\\n    .master(\"local\") \\\n    .getOrCreate()\n\n# Read the CSV file into a DataFrame\ndf = spark.read.csv(\"/temp/proto_temp.csv\", header=True, inferSchema=True)\n\n# Displays the content of the DataFrame to stdout\ndf.show()\n\n# Write the DataFrame to a Parquet file\ndf.write.parquet(\"/output/proto.parquet\")\n\n# Stop the SparkSession\nspark.stop()\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n- **SparkSession**: Use `SparkSession.builder` to create a session which is the entry point to work with DataFrames.\n- **Reading CSV**: Use `spark.read.csv` to directly read the CSV file as a DataFrame, with options like `header=True` and `inferSchema=True` to automatically handle column names and data types.\n- **Writing Parquet**: The `write.parquet` method is now correctly called on a DataFrame, allowing you to write the data to a Parquet file.\n\nThis should resolve the `AttributeError` and allow you to successfully convert your CSV data into a Parquet file."
