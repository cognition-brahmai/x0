The script works perfectly on MacOS X in Python 3.3x but it throws an error on a Windows computer in Python 3.2x stating that \"FileNotFoundError\" is not defined. I've found that Python 3.2 on Windows throws an \"IOError\" if the input filename is invalid, which is an issue I also encountered with Python 2.7 on Linux. If I change my code to except \"IOError\" instead of \"FileNotFoundError\", it no longer works on my Mac. Is there a way I can handle both exceptions without resorting to a generic \"except\"?\n\n```python\nfile = input(\"Type filename: \")\n\n...\ntry:\n    fileContent = open(filename, \"r\")\n    ...\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    ...\n```"

        "content": "To handle both exceptions (`FileNotFoundError` and `IOError`) without resorting to a generic `except`, you can catch multiple exceptions in a single `except` block. This way, your code will be compatible across different Python versions and platforms. Here's how you can modify your script:\n\n```python\nfile = input(\"Type filename: \")\n\nwhile True:\n    try:\n        with open(file, \"r\") as fileContent:\n            # Process the file\n            ...\n        break  # Exit the loop if file opening is successful\n    except (FileNotFoundError, IOError):\n        print(\"File not found. Please try again.\")\n        file = input(\"Type filename: \")\n```\n\nIn this modified code:\n\n- I've used a `while True` loop to keep prompting the user until a valid file is opened.\n- I've used `with` statement for opening the file, which is a good practice as it ensures the file is properly closed after its suite finishes.\n- The `except` block now catches both `FileNotFoundError` and `IOError`. This way, the script will work seamlessly on different platforms and Python versions that might raise either exception for a missing file.\n\nThis approach ensures that your script handles file-not-found errors gracefully on both MacOS with Python 3.3+ and Windows with Python 3.2 or earlier."
