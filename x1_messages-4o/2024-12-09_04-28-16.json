I am coming from a C++ background where you can declare a function after the call once you place its header before it. I am getting an error message that says \"function_name is not defined\". Here are the two examples I tried, one where I define the function before calling it and the other where I try to call the function before defining it:\n\nWhen declaring the function before calling, it works:\n```python\ndef Kerma():\n    return \"energy / mass\"    \n\nprint Kerma()\n```\nBut when trying to call the function before defining it, I encounter an error:\n```python\nprint Kerma()\n\ndef Kerma():\n    return \"energy / mass\"\n```\nAm I missing something or is this not possible in Python?"

        "content": "In Python, you cannot call a function before it is defined. This is because Python is an interpreted language, which means that it executes code line by line. When the interpreter encounters a function call, it needs to know what that function is, hence the function must be defined before it is called.\n\nThis behavior is different from C++ where you can declare a function prototype before its definition, allowing you to call it before it's fully defined. In Python, you must ensure that the function is defined before you attempt to call it.\n\nHere's how you can structure your code to avoid the error:\n\n```python\ndef Kerma():\n    return \"energy / mass\"\n\nprint(Kerma())\n```\n\nIf you need to use a function in multiple parts of your code, you can organize your code such that all function definitions are placed at the top of your file or module, ensuring they are defined before any calls to them are made.\n\nIf your use case requires more flexibility, such as forward declarations, you might need to rethink the design to fit Python's execution model. For example, you could use classes and methods or employ design patterns like decorators or callbacks, depending on the context."
