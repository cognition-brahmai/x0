Here's the correct way to do it:\n\n```python\n# Assuming my_list is your original list\nnew_list = my_list[-10:]\n```\n\nThis code will give you a new list `new_list` containing the last 10 elements of `my_list`, but only if the length of `my_list` is greater than or equal to 10. If `my_list` is shorter than 10 elements, it will simply return the entire list."
