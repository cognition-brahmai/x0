        "content": "The error message you're encountering, `ImportError: No module named redis`, indicates that the Python Redis module is not installed on your system. Installing Redis server on your machine using `sudo apt-get install redis-server` does not automatically install the Python client library needed to interact with Redis in your Python programs.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to install the Redis client library for Python. Since you are using Python 2.7, you can install the `redis-py` package using `pip`, Python's package manager. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. First, ensure `pip` is installed on your system. You can install it using the following command if it's not already available:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install python-pip\n   ```\n\n2. Once `pip` is installed, you can install the `redis` module using the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo pip install redis\n   ```\n\nThis should install the Redis client library for Python, and you should no longer encounter the `ImportError`.\n\nPlease note that Ubuntu 13.04 is an old release and it's recommended to upgrade to a more recent version of Ubuntu for better support and security updates. Additionally, Python 2 has reached its end of life, so consider upgrading your Python version to Python 3 and adjusting your code accordingly for future projects."
