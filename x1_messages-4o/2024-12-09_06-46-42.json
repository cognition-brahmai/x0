According to various resources, it is recommended to divide tests into Unit tests which are usually very fast and should be run with every build in a CI environment, and Integration tests which take more time to run and should be more of a daily run. However, I have noticed that most projects don't seem to have multiple test folders. Is there a way to ensure I only run Unit, Integration or both according to the situation (CI vs daily builds)? Also, when calculating test coverage, I assume I will need to run both. Am I on the right path in trying to divide the tests into these categories? Could you provide some examples of a project that has done this?"

        "content": "You're on the right track by wanting to separate unit tests and integration tests, as they serve different purposes and can be run at different times in your development pipeline. Pytest provides several mechanisms to help you organize and selectively run your tests based on categories like unit and integration tests.\n\n### Strategies for Separating Unit and Integration Tests\n\n1. **Directory Structure**: \n   - You can separate your tests by placing them in different directories, such as `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/`. This makes it easy to run all unit tests or integration tests by specifying the directory.\n\n2. **Markers**:\n   - Use pytest markers to differentiate between unit and integration tests. In your test files, you can mark tests as follows:\n     ```python\n     import pytest\n\n     @pytest.mark.unit\n     def test_unit_example():\n         assert True\n\n     @pytest.mark.integration\n     def test_integration_example():\n         assert True\n     ```\n   - Run specific tests using the `-m` option:\n     ```bash\n     pytest -m unit\n     pytest -m integration\n     ```\n\n3. **Configuration Files**:\n   - You can configure pytest to recognize and handle different types of tests using a `pytest.ini` or `conftest.py` file, where you define custom markers:\n     ```ini\n     # pytest.ini\n     [pytest]\n     markers =\n         unit: marks unit tests\n         integration: marks integration tests\n     ```\n\n4. **Custom Test Suites**:\n   - Create custom scripts or makefiles that run specific groups of tests based on your needs. For example, a `make test-unit` command could be set up to run only unit tests.\n\n5. **CI/CD Pipeline Configuration**:\n   - Configure your CI/CD pipeline to run different sets of tests based on triggers or schedules. For instance, run unit tests on every commit/pull request and integration tests nightly.\n\n### Test Coverage\n\nWhen calculating test coverage, you'll typically want to include both unit and integration tests to get a full picture of how much of your code is exercised. You can run:\n```bash\npytest --cov=my_package tests/unit\npytest --cov=my_package tests/integration\n```\nOr simply run coverage for both:\n```bash\npytest --cov=my_package tests/\n```\n\n### Examples of Projects\n\n1. **Real World Projects**: Many open-source projects on platforms like GitHub showcase the separation of unit and integration tests using similar strategies. Projects like `requests`, `Django`, or `Flask` often use directory structures and markers to manage different test types.\n\n2. **Example Structure**:\n   ```\n   my_project/\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 src/\n   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 my_package/\n   \u2514\u2500\u2500 tests/\n       \u251c\u2500\u2500 unit/\n       \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 test_module1.py\n       \u2514\u2500\u2500 integration/\n           \u2514\u2500\u2500 test_module1_integration.py\n   ```\n\nBy organizing your tests and using pytest's features, you can efficiently manage and run your tests according to your development and CI/CD needs."
