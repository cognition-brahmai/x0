I'm able to read from the file and loop through it line by line, but I'm unsure of how to apply the regular expression to each line."

        "content": "To apply a regular expression to each line of a file in Python, you can use the `re` module, which provides support for working with regular expressions. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:\n\n1. **Import the `re` module**: This module provides the necessary functions to work with regular expressions.\n\n2. **Open the file**: Use Python's built-in `open()` function to read the file line by line.\n\n3. **Compile the regular expression**: Use `re.compile()` to compile the regular expression pattern. This improves performance if you plan to use the same pattern multiple times.\n\n4. **Apply the regular expression on each line**: Use the `findall()` or `search()` method to apply the regex to each line.\n\nHere's a code example that demonstrates these steps:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Define the regular expression pattern\npattern = re.compile(r'f\\(\\s*([^,]+)\\s*,\\s*([^,]+)\\s*\\)')\n\n# Open the file in read mode\nfilename = 'your_file.txt'\nwith open(filename, 'r') as file:\n    # Loop through each line in the file\n    for line in file:\n        # Use findall to find all matches of the pattern in the line\n        matches = pattern.findall(line)\n        # If matches are found, process them\n        for match in matches:\n            # Each match is a tuple with captured groups\n            print(f\"Matched: {match}\")\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`re.compile(r'f\\(\\s*([^,]+)\\s*,\\s*([^,]+)\\s*\\)')`**: This compiles the regular expression pattern. The pattern is designed to match a function-like structure `f(arg1, arg2)` with optional spaces around the arguments.\n- **`with open(filename, 'r') as file:`**: Opens the file for reading. The `with` statement ensures proper resource management.\n- **`for line in file:`**: Iterates over each line in the file.\n- **`pattern.findall(line)`**: Finds all occurrences of the pattern in the current line and returns them as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the matched groups.\n- **`print(f\"Matched: {match}\")`**: Prints each match. Each match is a tuple containing the captured groups from the regex.\n\nThis approach reads the file line by line and applies the regular expression to each line, capturing the desired parts of the string that match the pattern. Adjust the `filename` variable to point to your actual file."
