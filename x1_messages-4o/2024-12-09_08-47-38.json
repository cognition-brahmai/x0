        "content": "To add a user input feature to your Java program that asks for a string and then prints it out, you can use the `Scanner` class, which is part of the `java.util` package. Here's a simple example of how you can implement this:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class UserInputExample {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Create a Scanner object to read input from the console\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        \n        // Prompt the user for input\n        System.out.println(\"Please enter a string:\");\n        \n        // Read the input string from the user\n        String userInput = scanner.nextLine();\n        \n        // Print out the input string\n        System.out.println(\"You entered: \" + userInput);\n        \n        // Close the scanner to free up resources\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of what each part does:\n\n1. **Import the Scanner Class:**\n   - `import java.util.Scanner;` allows you to use the `Scanner` class to read inputs.\n\n2. **Create a Scanner Object:**\n   - `Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);` creates a new `Scanner` object that reads from the standard input stream (usually the console).\n\n3. **Prompt the User:**\n   - `System.out.println(\"Please enter a string:\");` displays a message to the user prompting them to enter a string.\n\n4. **Read User Input:**\n   - `String userInput = scanner.nextLine();` reads the entire line of text entered by the user and stores it in a `String` variable called `userInput`.\n\n5. **Print the Input:**\n   - `System.out.println(\"You entered: \" + userInput);` outputs the string entered by the user.\n\n6. **Close the Scanner:**\n   - `scanner.close();` closes the `Scanner` object to free up system resources. It's a good practice to close it when it's no longer needed.\n\nBy following these steps, you can easily add user input capability to your Java program."
