However, when I use `print(False or None)`, it returns `None`. I was expecting them to behave the same way. Can someone explain why this is happening?"

        "content": "In Python, the `or` operator is a short-circuit logical operator that evaluates its operands from left to right and returns the first truthy value it encounters. If all values are falsy, it returns the last operand.\n\nHere's how it works for your examples:\n\n1. **`None or False`**:\n   - `None` is evaluated first. Since `None` is considered falsy in Python, it doesn't satisfy the condition.\n   - The evaluation moves to the next operand, which is `False`. Since there are no more operands and `False` is also falsy, it returns `False`.\n\n2. **`False or None`**:\n   - `False` is evaluated first. It is also falsy, so it doesn't satisfy the condition.\n   - The evaluation then moves to the next operand, which is `None`. Since there are no more operands and `None` is falsy, it returns `None`.\n\nIn both cases, the `or` operator returns the first truthy value encountered or the last operand if all are falsy. Therefore, the difference in output is due to the order of the operands and the short-circuit evaluation nature of the `or` operator."
