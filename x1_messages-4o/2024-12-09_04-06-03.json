However, I am experiencing an issue where the reader waits for the stream to be terminated before iterating the rows. Is this a limitation of the `csv` module or am I doing something wrong? Here is my reader and writer code:\n\nReader Code:\n```python\nimport csv\nimport sys\nimport time\n\nreader = csv.reader(sys.stdin)\nfor row in reader:\n    print \"Read: (%s) %r\" % (time.time(), row)\n```\n\nWriter Code:\n```python\nimport csv\nimport sys\nimport time\n\nwriter = csv.writer(sys.stdout)\nfor i in range(8):\n    writer.writerow([\"R%d\" % i, \"$\" * (i+1)])\n    sys.stdout.flush()\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n```\nWhen I run `python test_writer.py | python test_reader.py`, all print statements are executed at the same time, but I expect there to be a 500ms gap."

        "content": "The behavior you're experiencing is likely due to buffering in the standard input and output streams. By default, Python's standard I/O is line-buffered or fully buffered, which can cause the reader to wait until the buffer is full or the stream is closed before processing the input. This is why you're not observing the expected 500ms delay between each row being processed.\n\nTo address this issue, you can try two approaches:\n\n1. **Disable Buffering in the Writer**: You can disable buffering for the writer process by using the `-u` flag when executing your script. This flag forces the standard streams to be unbuffered.\n\n    ```bash\n    python -u test_writer.py | python test_reader.py\n    ```\n\n2. **Use `sys.stdout.flush()` in the Writer**: You have already included `sys.stdout.flush()` in your writer code, which is generally the correct approach. However, ensure that your environment respects this flushing. The `-u` flag as mentioned above ensures this.\n\n3. **Use `sys.stdin` in Binary Mode**: If your platform or Python version is causing issues with text I/O buffering, you can read `sys.stdin` in binary mode and decode it manually.\n\nHere's how you can modify your reader and writer code:\n\n**Reader Code:**\n```python\nimport csv\nimport sys\nimport time\nimport io\n\nsys.stdin = io.TextIOWrapper(sys.stdin.buffer, newline='')\n\nreader = csv.reader(sys.stdin)\nfor row in reader:\n    print(\"Read: (%s) %r\" % (time.time(), row))\n```\n\n**Writer Code:**\n```python\nimport csv\nimport sys\nimport time\n\nwriter = csv.writer(sys.stdout)\nfor i in range(8):\n    writer.writerow([\"R%d\" % i, \"$\" * (i+1)])\n    sys.stdout.flush()  # Ensure data is written immediately\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n```\n\nBy ensuring that the writer is flushing its output and the reader is set up correctly to handle the stream without buffering issues, you should see each row processed with the expected delay.\n\nIf you're still encountering issues, you might want to double-check the environment in which you're running the scripts, as some systems have different default buffering behaviors."
