        "content": "You can create a program to remove duplicate words from a string using various programming languages. Below, I'll provide a simple example in Python, which is a widely used language for string manipulation:\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicate_words(input_string):\n    # Split the string into words\n    words = input_string.split()\n    \n    # Use a set to track unique words\n    unique_words = set()\n    \n    # Use a list to maintain the order of words\n    result = []\n    \n    for word in words:\n        if word not in unique_words:\n            unique_words.add(word)\n            result.append(word)\n    \n    # Join the resulting words back into a string\n    return ' '.join(result)\n\n# Example usage\ninput_string = \"This is a test test string with duplicate duplicate words\"\noutput_string = remove_duplicate_words(input_string)\nprint(output_string)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Splitting the String**: The input string is split into individual words using the `split()` function, which creates a list of words.\n\n2. **Tracking Unique Words**: A set is used to keep track of unique words because sets automatically handle duplicates by only storing unique items.\n\n3. **Maintaining Order**: A list is used to maintain the order of words as they appear in the original string.\n\n4. **Iterating and Adding**: The function iterates over each word. If a word is not in the set of unique words, it is added to both the set and the result list.\n\n5. **Joining Words**: Finally, the list of unique words is joined back into a single string with spaces separating the words.\n\nThis program efficiently removes duplicate words while preserving the original order of unique words. You can adjust and extend this code to handle more complex scenarios or integrate it into larger applications."
