This test is supposed to verify if the correct files have been installed in the correct place. I am trying to assert that a file or folder exists using the code `assert os.path.exists(LOCAL_INSTALL_DIR) == 1`. However, I am encountering an AssertionError. Could you help me understand why I am getting this error and how can I fix it? Here is my function:\n\n```python\ndef check_installation_files_exist():\n    assert os.path.exists(LOCAL_INSTALL_DIR) == 1\n    assert os.path.exists(INSTALL_DIR) == 1\n    correct_install_files = normalise_file_names( os.listdir( LOCAL_INSTALL_DIR ) )\n    installed_files       = normalise_file_names( os.listdir( INSTALL_DIR ) )\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to how assertions are being used to check the existence of files or directories. In Python, `os.path.exists()` returns a boolean value, `True` if the path exists and `False` otherwise. In your function, you're comparing the result of `os.path.exists()` to `1`, which will always result in a `False` assertion (`True` is not equal to `1` in this context), leading to an `AssertionError`.\n\nHere's how you can fix it:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef check_installation_files_exist():\n    assert os.path.exists(LOCAL_INSTALL_DIR), f\"The directory {LOCAL_INSTALL_DIR} does not exist.\"\n    assert os.path.exists(INSTALL_DIR), f\"The directory {INSTALL_DIR} does not exist.\"\n    correct_install_files = normalise_file_names(os.listdir(LOCAL_INSTALL_DIR))\n    installed_files = normalise_file_names(os.listdir(INSTALL_DIR))\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Use Boolean Values:** The assertion should directly verify the boolean value returned by `os.path.exists()`. Therefore, you simply assert the existence without comparing it to `1`.\n\n2. **Add Descriptive Error Messages:** Adding a descriptive message to the assertion helps in understanding what went wrong when the assertion fails. This is done by providing a second argument to the `assert` statement.\n\n3. **Ensure Variables are Defined:** Make sure that `LOCAL_INSTALL_DIR`, `INSTALL_DIR`, and the function `normalise_file_names` are properly defined and contain the expected values or implementations before calling `check_installation_files_exist()`.\n\nUsing this approach, you can verify the existence of the directories more effectively. If the directories exist, the assertions will pass; otherwise, you'll receive a clear error message indicating which directory is missing."
