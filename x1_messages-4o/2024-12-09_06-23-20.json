Currently, I am using stdout to direct the result to an output file and I don't want to do this manually for each file. Is there a way to read the file name from stdin or use some built-in functions to do this more easily?\n\nHere's my current Python script (parse.py):\n\n```python\nfilename = 'file1'\nf = open(filename, 'r')\ncontent = f.read()\nprint filename, len(content)\n```\n\nI run my script and direct its output to another file like this:\n\n```sh\npython parse.py >> output\n```\n\nI'm looking for a solution that works similar to this shell script:\n\n```sh\nls | awk '{print}' | python parse.py >> output \n```"

        "content": "To modify your script to automatically handle every file in a folder, you can use Python's built-in modules like `os` and `glob` to iterate over all files in a directory. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Use the `os` module to list all files in the directory.\n2. Loop over each file, open it, and calculate the number of characters.\n3. Print the filename and the character count.\n\nHere's the modified script that achieves this:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Specify the directory containing the files\ndirectory = '.'  # '.' means current directory, change if needed\n\n# Loop over each file in the directory\nfor filename in os.listdir(directory):\n    # Construct the full file path\n    file_path = os.path.join(directory, filename)\n    \n    # Check if it's a file (not a directory)\n    if os.path.isfile(file_path):\n        with open(file_path, 'r') as f:\n            content = f.read()\n            print(filename, len(content))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`os.listdir(directory)`**: Lists all entries in the specified directory.\n- **`os.path.join(directory, filename)`**: Constructs a full path to the file.\n- **`os.path.isfile(file_path)`**: Checks if the path is a file and not a directory. This prevents errors if there are subdirectories.\n- **`with open(file_path, 'r') as f:`**: Opens the file and ensures it gets closed automatically after processing.\n\n### Running the Script:\n\nYou can run the script and direct its output to an output file as follows:\n\n```sh\npython parse.py >> output\n```\n\nThis setup will process each file in the specified directory, calculate the number of characters, and append the results to the `output` file. Adjust the `directory` variable if your files are not in the current working directory."
