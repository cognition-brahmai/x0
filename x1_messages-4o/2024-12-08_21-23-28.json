        "content": "To tackle this problem, we'll create a JavaScript function that parses an HTML page containing production log data, extracts timestamps, and calculates the time differences between events in minutes. We'll consider various timestamp formats and nested structures. Additionally, we'll account for time zone differences by normalizing all timestamps to a common time zone before calculating differences.\n\nHere's a possible implementation:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Production Log</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <!-- Example of a log with timestamps -->\n    <div class=\"log\">\n        <div class=\"event\">\n            <span class=\"timestamp\">2023-10-05T14:48:00+05:30</span>\n            <span>Event 1</span>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"event\">\n            <span class=\"timestamp\">2023-10-05T15:10:00+05:30</span>\n            <span>Event 2</span>\n        </div>\n        <!-- More events with different structures and formats -->\n    </div>\n\n    <script>\n        function extractAndCalculateTimeDifferences() {\n            const timestampElements = document.querySelectorAll('.timestamp');\n            const timestamps = [];\n\n            // Extract timestamps and parse them into Date objects\n            timestampElements.forEach(element => {\n                const timestampStr = element.textContent.trim();\n                const date = new Date(timestampStr);\n                if (!isNaN(date)) {\n                    timestamps.push(date);\n                }\n            });\n\n            timestamps.sort((a, b) => a - b); // Sort dates to ensure chronological order\n\n            const timeDifferences = [];\n            for (let i = 1; i < timestamps.length; i++) {\n                const diffMs = timestamps[i] - timestamps[i - 1];\n                const diffMinutes = diffMs / 1000 / 60;\n                timeDifferences.push(diffMinutes);\n            }\n\n            return timeDifferences;\n        }\n\n        function displayTimeDifferences() {\n            const timeDifferences = extractAndCalculateTimeDifferences();\n            timeDifferences.forEach((diff, index) => {\n                console.log(`Time difference between event ${index + 1} and event ${index + 2}: ${diff} minutes`);\n            });\n        }\n\n        window.onload = displayTimeDifferences;\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **HTML Structure**: The HTML contains a series of events, each with a nested timestamp. The timestamps are formatted in ISO 8601 format, which includes time zone information.\n\n2. **JavaScript Functionality**:\n   - We select all elements with the class `timestamp`.\n   - Extract and trim the text content of each timestamp element.\n   - Parse the extracted timestamp strings into JavaScript `Date` objects, taking advantage of their ability to handle different formats and time zones.\n   - Sort the `Date` objects to ensure they are in chronological order.\n   - Calculate the time difference in minutes between each consecutive timestamp.\n   - Return the calculated time differences.\n\n3. **Time Zone Handling**: By using the `Date` object, we automatically handle time zone differences as it normalizes them to UTC internally.\n\n4. **Display**: The function logs the time differences to the console when the page is loaded.\n\nThis implementation can be adapted for more complex log structures by modifying the way we query and parse the HTML elements. You can also extend it to support custom date formats by using libraries like `moment.js` or `date-fns` for more complex parsing and formatting needs."
