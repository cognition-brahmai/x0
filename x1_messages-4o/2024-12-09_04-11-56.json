I'm using the cv2.imread function to read an image and I want to check if the image is read correctly before proceeding. Currently, I'm using the type of the returned value to perform the check, but I'm looking for a simpler solution. Is there a way to perform the check using an if statement like `if(img): #do stuff`?\n\nHere is the code I have so far:\n\n```python\nimport cv2\nimport numpy as np\n... \nimg = cv2.imread(\"myImage.jpg\")\n\nif (type(img) is np.ndarray): \n     #do stuff with image\n```\n\nHowever, when the image is not read correctly, I get a ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()."

        "content": "To check if an image has been correctly read using OpenCV's `cv2.imread` function, you can simply check if the returned value, `img`, is `None`. If the image is not read correctly (for example, if the file path is incorrect or the file doesn't exist), `cv2.imread` will return `None`. Therefore, you can use a straightforward `if` statement to perform this check.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport cv2\n\nimg = cv2.imread(\"myImage.jpg\")\n\nif img is not None:\n    # Do stuff with the image\n    print(\"Image read successfully.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Failed to read image.\")\n```\n\nThis approach is simpler and more intuitive because it directly checks if `img` is `None`, which indicates that the image was not read successfully. You avoid the ambiguity of evaluating the truth value of a NumPy array, which is what caused the `ValueError` in your original approach."
