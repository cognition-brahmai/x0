        "content": "In Python, there isn't a built-in method like `map_values` or `mutate_values_with` for dictionaries. However, you can transform the dictionary using a dictionary comprehension, which is both concise and efficient.\n\nYour initial approach using `dict` and a list comprehension is almost correct, but in Python 3, `iteritems()` has been replaced by `items()`. Here's how you can achieve the desired transformation using dictionary comprehension:\n\n```python\nmy_dictionary = {k: f(v) for k, v in my_dictionary.items()}\n```\n\nThis code will create a new dictionary with the same keys as `my_dictionary` but with values transformed by the function `f`.\n\nIf you're using Python 2, your approach would look like this:\n\n```python\nmy_dictionary = dict([(k, f(v)) for k, v in my_dictionary.iteritems()])\n```\n\nHowever, it's recommended to use dictionary comprehensions for their readability and performance benefits, which is available in Python 2.7 and later:\n\n```python\nmy_dictionary = {k: f(v) for k, v in my_dictionary.iteritems()}\n```\n\nRemember to define your function `f` before using it. If you want to maintain the original dictionary and create a new one, you can do this:\n\n```python\nnew_dictionary = {k: f(v) for k, v in my_dictionary.items()}\n```\n\nThis way, `my_dictionary` remains unchanged, and `new_dictionary` contains the transformed values."
