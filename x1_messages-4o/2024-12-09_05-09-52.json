        "content": "To validate a JSON Schema in Python, you can use the `jsonschema` library, which provides the functionality to validate JSON documents against a JSON Schema. Interestingly, the JSON Schema itself is a JSON document, and there is a schema for JSON Schemas, which is known as the \"meta-schema.\"\n\nHere's how you can validate a JSON Schema using the `jsonschema` library:\n\n1. **Install the `jsonschema` library**: If you haven't already, you can install it using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install jsonschema\n   ```\n\n2. **Validate your JSON Schema**: You can use the `Draft7Validator` (or other draft versions if needed) to validate your schema against the meta-schema. Here's an example:\n\n   ```python\n   import jsonschema\n   from jsonschema import Draft7Validator\n\n   # Define your JSON Schema\n   my_schema = {\n       \"type\": \"object\",\n       \"properties\": {\n           \"name\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n           \"age\": {\"type\": \"integer\", \"minimum\": 0}\n       },\n       \"required\": [\"name\", \"age\"]\n   }\n\n   # Retrieve the meta-schema for Draft 7\n   meta_schema = Draft7Validator.META_SCHEMA\n\n   # Validate your schema against the meta-schema\n   try:\n       Draft7Validator.check_schema(my_schema)\n       print(\"The JSON Schema is valid.\")\n   except jsonschema.exceptions.SchemaError as e:\n       print(f\"Schema Error: {e.message}\")\n\n   ```\n\nIn this example, `Draft7Validator.check_schema()` is used to ensure that your JSON Schema is valid according to the Draft 7 meta-schema. If your schema is invalid, a `SchemaError` will be raised, providing details about what is wrong with your schema.\n\nYou can adjust the version (e.g., `Draft4Validator`, `Draft6Validator`, etc.) based on which draft version of JSON Schema you're targeting."
