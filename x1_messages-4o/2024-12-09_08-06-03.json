For example, if I have a dictionary `attributes` like this:\n\n```python\nattributes = {\n    'size': ['s','m','l'],\n    'color': ['black', 'orange'],\n}\n```\n\nUsing `attributes.values()`, I get `[['black', 'orange'], ['s', 'm', 'l']]`. However, I want the resulting list of lists to be sorted by the dictionary key in reverse order -- size and then color, not color and then size. I want this: `[['s', 'm', 'l'], ['black', 'orange']]`. I don't necessarily know what the dictionary keys will be beforehand, but I always know if I want them in alphabetical or reverse alphabetical order. The only solution I could come up with is:\n\n```python\nkeys = sorted(attributes.keys(), reverse=True)\nresult = []\nfor key in keys:\n    result.append(attributes[key])\n```\nIt seems a bit verbose just to sort the list. Is there a more Pythonic way to do this?"

        "content": "Yes, there's a more concise and Pythonic way to achieve this by using list comprehensions. You can sort the keys in reverse order and then use a list comprehension to build your desired list. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nattributes = {\n    'size': ['s', 'm', 'l'],\n    'color': ['black', 'orange'],\n}\n\n# Using list comprehension to sort the keys in reverse and get the values\nresult = [attributes[key] for key in sorted(attributes.keys(), reverse=True)]\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis approach uses a list comprehension to iterate over the sorted keys in reverse order and collects the corresponding values into a new list. It's more concise and leverages the power of Python's list comprehensions to make the code more readable."
