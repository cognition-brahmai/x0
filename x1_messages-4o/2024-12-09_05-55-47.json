However, when I attempt to resize the window, it doesn't work as expected. The application is a grid program and I want the grid to resize/shrink as the window is resized. Here is my code:\n\n```python\nimport pygame,math\nfrom pygame.locals import *\n# Define some colors\nblack    = (   0,   0,   0)\nwhite    = ( 255, 255, 255)\ngreen    = (   0, 255,   0)\nred      = ( 255,   0,   0)\n\n# This sets the width and height of each grid location\nwidth=50\nheight=20\nsize=[500,500]\n# This sets the margin between each cell\nmargin=1\n\n# Initialize pygame\npygame.init()\n\n# Set the height and width of the screen\nscreen=pygame.display.set_mode(size,RESIZABLE)\n\n# Set title of screen\npygame.display.set_caption(\"My Game\")\n\n#Loop until the user clicks the close button.\ndone=False\n\n# Used to manage how fast the screen updates\nclock=pygame.time.Clock()\n\n# -------- Main Program Loop -----------\nwhile done==False:\n    for event in pygame.event.get(): # User did something\n        if event.type == pygame.QUIT: # If user clicked close\n            done=True # Flag that we are done so we exit this loop\n        if event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:\n            height+=10\n\n    # Set the screen background\n    screen.fill(black)\n\n    # Draw the grid\n    for row in range(int(math.ceil(size[1]/height))+1):\n        for column in range(int(math.ceil(size[0]/width))+1):\n            color = white\n            pygame.draw.rect(screen,color,[(margin+width)*column+margin,(margin+height)*row+margin,width,height])\n\n    # Limit to 20 frames per second\n    clock.tick(20)\n\n    # Go ahead and update the screen with what we've drawn.\n    pygame.display.flip()\n# Be IDLE friendly. If you forget this line, the program will 'hang'\n# on exit.\npygame.quit ()\n```\n\nCould you please help me identify why the window and grid are not resizing as expected?"

        "content": "Certainly! To make the grid resize dynamically with the window, you need to update the grid dimensions when the window size changes. In your current code, you are not handling the window resize event explicitly. We need to capture the `VIDEORESIZE` event to adjust the grid based on the new window size.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport pygame, math\nfrom pygame.locals import *\n\n# Define some colors\nblack = (0, 0, 0)\nwhite = (255, 255, 255)\n\n# This sets the width and height of each grid location\nwidth = 50\nheight = 20\n\n# This sets the margin between each cell\nmargin = 1\n\n# Initialize pygame\npygame.init()\n\n# Initial screen size\nsize = [500, 500]\nscreen = pygame.display.set_mode(size, RESIZABLE)\n\n# Set title of screen\npygame.display.set_caption(\"Resizable Grid\")\n\n# Loop until the user clicks the close button.\ndone = False\n\n# Used to manage how fast the screen updates\nclock = pygame.time.Clock()\n\n# -------- Main Program Loop -----------\nwhile not done:\n    for event in pygame.event.get():\n        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n            done = True\n\n        # Handle window resize event\n        if event.type == pygame.VIDEORESIZE:\n            size = event.size\n            screen = pygame.display.set_mode(size, RESIZABLE)\n\n    # Set the screen background\n    screen.fill(black)\n\n    # Draw the grid\n    for row in range(int(math.ceil(size[1] / height)) + 1):\n        for column in range(int(math.ceil(size[0] / width)) + 1):\n            color = white\n            pygame.draw.rect(screen, color, \n                             [(margin + width) * column + margin,\n                              (margin + height) * row + margin,\n                              width, height])\n\n    # Limit to 20 frames per second\n    clock.tick(20)\n\n    # Update the screen with what we've drawn\n    pygame.display.flip()\n\npygame.quit()\n```\n\n### Changes Made:\n1. **VIDEORESIZE Event Handling**: Added handling for the `VIDEORESIZE` event to update the screen size when the window is resized.\n2. **Dynamic Screen Update**: The `screen` is updated with the new size using `pygame.display.set_mode(size, RESIZABLE)` whenever the window is resized.\n\nNow, when you resize the window, the grid will adjust according to the new dimensions. You can further modify the `width` and `height` of the grid cells if you want the cells themselves to resize proportionally as well."
