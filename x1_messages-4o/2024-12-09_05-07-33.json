I currently have a workaround but it gives me undefined behavior. The conditions are that I do not have enough GPU memory available to load the variables twice, the validation set is too large to pre-compute and store onto disk, and both training and validation data cannot be simply read from disk, but are generated on-the-fly. This makes it impossible to reliably pre-compute the size of the validation set in advance. The effective validation set size is also not necessarily a multiple of the batch size."

        "content": "To evaluate a validation set after every K training iterations in TensorFlow using separate queues for training and validation without resorting to separate `tf.Session` instances, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Use Two QueueRunners:** Set up two separate data pipelines using `tf.data.Dataset` APIs for both training and validation. This will help manage input pipelines effectively without needing to manage separate sessions.\n\n2. **Initialize Separate Iterators:** Create two iterators, one for training data and another for validation data. These iterators can be managed in the same session context.\n\n3. **Control Dependencies and Iteration:** Use control dependencies to manage the flow between training and validation iterations. This allows you to switch between training and validation steps without needing separate sessions or processes.\n\n4. **Use a Loop for Training and Validation:** Implement a loop where you iterate over your training data for K iterations, then switch to your validation dataset to evaluate it. Once done, switch back to your training dataset iterator.\n\n5. **Dynamic Batch Size Adjustment:** Adjust the batch size dynamically for the validation set evaluation to handle cases where the validation set size is not a multiple of the batch size. This can be done using `tf.data.experimental.bucket_by_sequence_length` or by padding the last batch.\n\n6. **Memory Management:** To handle limited GPU memory, ensure that you clear the GPU memory cache after each evaluation using TensorFlow functions like `tf.keras.backend.clear_session()` to free up memory.\n\nHere is a simplified example of how you might structure your code:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Define your model\ndef create_model():\n    # Define a simple model here\n    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([\n        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_shape,)),\n        tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')\n    ])\n    return model\n\n# Training and validation datasets\ntrain_dataset = ...  # Define your training dataset\nval_dataset = ...    # Define your validation dataset\n\n# Create iterators\ntrain_iterator = iter(train_dataset)\nval_iterator = iter(val_dataset)\n\n# Create a strategy to manage GPU memory\nstrategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()\n\nwith strategy.scope():\n    model = create_model()\n    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Training loop\nK = 100  # Number of training iterations before validation\nsteps_per_epoch = ...  # Define number of steps per epoch\n\nfor epoch in range(num_epochs):\n    for step in range(steps_per_epoch):\n        # Perform a single training step\n        batch_data = next(train_iterator)\n        model.train_on_batch(batch_data)\n\n        # Every K iterations, evaluate on the validation set\n        if step % K == 0:\n            val_loss, val_accuracy = model.evaluate(val_dataset, steps=validation_steps)\n            print(f\"Validation loss: {val_loss}, Validation accuracy: {val_accuracy}\")\n\n    # Optionally save model checkpoints, adjust learning rates, etc.\n\n# Clear session to free up memory\ntf.keras.backend.clear_session()\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that you efficiently manage memory while switching between training and validation within the same session, leveraging TensorFlow's data pipeline capabilities. Adjust the iterator switching and batch handling according to your dataset specifics."
