It works fine with columns that don't have spaces in their names, like 'c', but I get a SyntaxError when I try to query a column with a space in its name, like 'a b'. I don't want to replace the space with other characters like '_'. Is there a way around this issue? \n\nHere is the code I am using and the error I am getting:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\na = pd.DataFrame(columns=[\"a b\", \"c\"])\na[\"a b\"] = [1,2,3,4]\na[\"c\"] = [5,6,7,8]\na.query('a b==5')\n```\n\nAnd the error message:\n\n```python\na b ==5\n  ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n```\n\nI know a workaround using pandasql where I can put the variable name inside brackets, for example: [a b]. But is there a way to solve this without using pandasql?"

Here's how you can modify your code to query the column with a space in its name:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create the DataFrame\na = pd.DataFrame(columns=[\"a b\", \"c\"])\na[\"a b\"] = [1, 2, 3, 4]\na[\"c\"] = [5, 6, 7, 8]\n\n# Use backticks to enclose the column name with spaces\nresult = a.query('`a b` == 5')\nprint(result)\n```\n\nBy using backticks around the column name `a b`, you can successfully query the DataFrame without encountering a `SyntaxError`."
