However, you can easily achieve this with a simple conditional check and string slicing. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef remove_last_char_if_special(s, special_char):\n    if s.endswith(special_char):\n        return s[:-1]\n    return s\n\n# Example usage\nstring = \"example\\\\\"\nspecial_char = \"\\\\\"\nresult = remove_last_char_if_special(string, special_char)\nprint(result)  # Output: \"example\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the `remove_last_char_if_special` function checks if the string `s` ends with the specified `special_char`. If it does, it returns the string without the last character using slicing (`s[:-1]`). Otherwise, it returns the original string unchanged."
