        "content": "To execute a Makefile using `setup.py` during the build process, you can subclass the `build` command from `setuptools` and override the `run` method to include the execution of the Makefile. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:\n\n1. **Import Required Modules**: You will need to import necessary modules from `setuptools` and `subprocess` to handle the custom build process.\n\n2. **Subclass the Build Command**: Subclass the `build` command to customize the build process.\n\n3. **Override the Run Method**: In this method, you'll execute the Makefile before proceeding with the regular build process. Use `subprocess` to run the `make` command.\n\n4. **Register the Custom Build Command**: You'll need to register your custom build command in the `cmdclass` argument of `setup()` in your `setup.py`.\n\nHere is an example of how you might implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom setuptools import setup\nfrom setuptools.command.build import build as _build\nimport subprocess\n\nclass CustomBuild(_build):\n    def run(self):\n        # Execute the Makefile\n        try:\n            subprocess.check_call(['make'])\n        except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:\n            print(f\"Error during make execution: {e}\")\n            raise\n\n        # Call the original build process\n        _build.run(self)\n\nsetup(\n    name='your_package_name',\n    version='0.1',\n    packages=['your_package'],\n    cmdclass={\n        'build': CustomBuild,\n    },\n    # ... other setup parameters ...\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **CustomBuild Class**: This class inherits from `setuptools.command.build.build`. The `run` method is overridden to first execute `make` before calling the original `run` method of `build`.\n\n- **subprocess.check_call**: This is used to execute the `make` command. It will raise a `CalledProcessError` if the command exits with a non-zero status, which allows you to handle errors during the make process.\n\n- **cmdclass Parameter**: By passing the `CustomBuild` class in the `cmdclass` dictionary, you override the default build behavior with your custom build process.\n\nMake sure the `Makefile` is configured properly and that all necessary build dependencies are available in your environment. This setup will execute the Makefile only during the build phase, not during installation."
