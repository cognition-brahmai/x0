Now, none of the pages on my site load and I encounter the error \"ImportError No module named context_processors\". Upon looking through the Django and allauth documentation, I found out that the context_processors have moved in Django 1.8 and specific allauth tags are no longer needed in the TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS of settings.py. I'm not sure if this is a Django or allauth issue and where to start troubleshooting. Can someone guide me on what needs to be changed in the settings? Following is the traceback for reference:\n\n```\nDjango Version: 1.8.4\nPython Version: 2.7.6\nInstalled Applications:\n('django.contrib.admin',\n 'django.contrib.auth',\n 'django.contrib.contenttypes',\n 'django.contrib.sessions',\n 'django.contrib.messages',\n 'django.contrib.staticfiles',\n 'plant',\n 'journal',\n 'userimg',\n 'django.contrib.sites',\n 'allauth',\n 'allauth.account')\nInstalled Middleware:\n('django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',\n 'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',\n 'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',\n 'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',\n 'django.contrib.auth.middleware.SessionAuthenticationMiddleware',\n 'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware',\n 'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware')\n...\n\nException Type: ImportError at /plant/\nException Value: No module named context_processors\n```"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to changes in Django's template system between version 1.6 and 1.8. In Django 1.8, the template system was overhauled, and the organization of context processors was changed. This means that the way you specify context processors in your `settings.py` has also changed.\n\nHere's how you can update your settings to be compatible with Django 1.8:\n\n1. **Update TEMPLATE Settings:**\n\n   In Django 1.8, the `TEMPLATES` setting was introduced, replacing the older `TEMPLATE_*` settings. You need to update your `settings.py` to use the new `TEMPLATES` setting.\n\n   Here's an example of how you might configure it:\n\n   ```python\n   TEMPLATES = [\n       {\n           'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',\n           'DIRS': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')],\n           'APP_DIRS': True,\n           'OPTIONS': {\n               'context_processors': [\n                   'django.template.context_processors.debug',\n                   'django.template.context_processors.request',\n                   'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',\n                   'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',\n                   # Add any additional context processors here\n               ],\n           },\n       },\n   ]\n   ```\n\n2. **Remove Deprecated Settings:**\n\n   Ensure that you have removed any old `TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS` and related settings, as they are no longer used in Django 1.8.\n\n3. **Check Installed Apps and Middleware:**\n\n   Make sure that all necessary apps and middleware are correctly listed in your settings. From your traceback, it seems like they are, but double-check for any potential typos or missing entries.\n\n4. **Update Allauth Configuration:**\n\n   Since `django-allauth` relies on context processors, ensure that you have the necessary allauth settings updated. You may not need specific allauth context processors anymore, but do verify whether other configurations for allauth need updating. Check the [django-allauth documentation](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for any version-specific changes.\n\n5. **Static and Media Files:**\n\n   If you have any custom templates or static files, ensure their paths are correctly set in the `DIRS` within the `TEMPLATES` setting.\n\n6. **Test the Server:**\n\n   Once you've made these changes, restart your Django server and check if the issue is resolved. Monitor the server logs for any other errors that may arise.\n\nBy updating your `settings.py` file as described, you should resolve the \"No module named context_processors\" error and get your Django site running again on version 1.8."
