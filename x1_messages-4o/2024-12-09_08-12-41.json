I already have an existing unit-testing framework based on unittest with custom runners and extensions that I wish to use. I prefer lightweight tests that can run in a very short time repeatedly without disrupting my development rhythm. For this, I need a set of small, lightweight simulations of the key App Engine subsystems like data store, memcache, request/response objects, webapp handlers, user handling, mail, etc. Should I rely on mox, which means mocking each subsystem used in a test and setting up all expectations or should I create my own simulation of each subsystem? Also, could you suggest if there are any existing open source set of such simulators that I can reuse or minimally tweak?"

        "content": "When working on large Python-based projects, especially those involving Google App Engine, it's essential to adopt a unit-testing strategy that enables rapid iteration without compromising test coverage. Here are some options and strategies you might consider for your situation:\n\n1. **Mocking with Mox or Similar Libraries**:\n   - **Mox**: This is a powerful library for mocking in Python. It allows you to create mocks, set expectations, and verify interactions, which is useful for ensuring that your code interacts correctly with the App Engine subsystems.\n   - **Pros**: Allows for fine-grained control and verification of interactions with subsystems.\n   - **Cons**: Can become cumbersome with large tests due to the need to set expectations and manage mocks.\n\n2. **Creating Simulations**:\n   - Instead of relying solely on mocking, you could create lightweight simulations or stubs of key App Engine subsystems. This approach allows you to simulate the behavior of these services without needing a live environment.\n   - **Pros**: Tests can be more straightforward and less dependent on the intricacies of mocks. It might also lead to more robust tests that do not break with minor refactoring.\n   - **Cons**: Requires initial effort to create these simulations, and updates may be needed if the App Engine APIs change.\n\n3. **Existing Open Source Simulators**:\n   - **App Engine Testbed**: Google provides an App Engine Testbed that simulates the environment. It allows you to test your application without deploying it to App Engine. It supports many App Engine services like the datastore, memcache, task queues, etc.\n   - **Pros**: Directly supported by Google, which ensures compatibility and updates.\n   - **Cons**: Might be heavier than custom mocks/simulations for extremely lightweight testing needs.\n\n4. **Hybrid Approach**:\n   - Consider a hybrid approach by using the testbed for services like the datastore and memcache, but relying on mocks for more straightforward interactions or where you need fine-grained control.\n   - This approach can balance the benefits of both strategies.\n\n5. **Exploring Other Libraries**:\n   - **pytest**: While not specifically for App Engine, pytest is a very powerful testing framework that can be extended with plugins and used in conjunction with mocking libraries.\n   - **Mock**: Python's built-in `unittest.mock` library can also be a good alternative to Mox, providing flexibility in mocking objects.\n\nUltimately, the best strategy might involve a combination of these techniques. It would be wise to start with the App Engine Testbed for its comprehensive coverage and then supplement it with mocks or stubs where necessary for lightweight and faster tests. This approach ensures that you have both depth and speed in your testing strategy."
