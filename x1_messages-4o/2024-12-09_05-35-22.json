I am unable to find a clear and simple example or explanation in the project pages of pytest, pytest-asyncio, or pytest-aiohttp. I am using Python 3.6.3, pytest 3.4.2, pytest-asyncio 0.8.0 and pytest-aiohttp 0.3.0. Can anyone provide a solution for this problem?"

        "content": "You're encountering this issue because `pytest` doesn't natively support async fixtures in the same way it does for async test functions. However, `pytest-asyncio` provides support for async fixtures. Let's address your issue step by step:\n\n1. **Ensure Proper Setup**: Make sure you're using `pytest-asyncio` to handle async fixtures. You also need to have `pytest-aiohttp` properly set up if you're working with `aiohttp`.\n\n2. **Use `pytest-asyncio` for Async Fixtures**: You can define async fixtures using `pytest-asyncio` by marking your test function with the `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorator. This allows your test function and fixtures to be async.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport pytest\nfrom aiohttp import web\n\n# Ensure you have this decorator for async tests\n@pytest.mark.asyncio\nasync def test_app(create_x, auth):\n    api_client, x_id = create_x\n    resp = await api_client.get(f'my_res/{x_id}', headers=auth)\n    assert resp.status == web.HTTPOk.status_code\n\n# Use pytest-asyncio's event loop for async fixtures\n@pytest.fixture\nasync def create_x(api_client):\n    x_id = await add_x(api_client)\n    return api_client, x_id\n\n# Make sure to set up the event loop policy for asyncio if needed\n@pytest.fixture\ndef loop(event_loop):\n    return event_loop\n```\n\n**Additional Notes**:\n\n- **Ensure Compatibility**: Make sure all required packages (`pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, `aiohttp`, etc.) are updated to versions compatible with each other and your Python version.\n- **Check Event Loop Policy**: In some environments, you might need to explicitly set the event loop policy. This can be done in your test setup if necessary.\n- **Use of Decorators**: Ensure that all async test functions are decorated with `@pytest.mark.asyncio`.\n\nBy using `pytest-asyncio`, you enable the use of async fixtures seamlessly, and you don't need to manually run the event loop within your fixtures or tests. This should solve your problem in a more elegant and straightforward way."
