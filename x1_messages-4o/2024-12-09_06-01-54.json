        "content": "The issue you're encountering comes from the way you are redirecting the output in your shell command. When you run the Python script with `python >/dev/null`, it only redirects the standard output (`stdout`) of the `python` process itself to `/dev/null`, but it doesn't affect how the subprocess's `stderr` is handled within the script.\n\nIn your Python script, you are correctly using `stderr=subprocess.STDOUT` in the `subprocess.call` function, which means that the subprocess's `stderr` is being redirected to its `stdout`. However, since this is being executed as a separate process, its combined `stdout` (which now includes `stderr`) is still being output to the terminal unless explicitly redirected.\n\nTo correctly redirect the combined output of the subprocess to `/dev/null`, you should modify the way you execute your Python script, ensuring that the combined output of the subprocess is also redirected. You can do this by using a `subprocess.Popen` with `stdout=subprocess.PIPE` and then explicitly redirecting the output to `/dev/null` within the script.\n\nHere's how you can achieve that:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\nwith open('/dev/null', 'w') as devnull:\n    subprocess.call([\"ls\", \"/404\"], stdout=devnull, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)\n```\n\nNow, when you run your script, it will correctly redirect both the standard output and standard error of the subprocess to `/dev/null`, and you won't see any output in the terminal."
