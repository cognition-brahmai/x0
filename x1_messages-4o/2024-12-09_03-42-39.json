I want to check if something matches a regex and then print the first group, but I find the intermediate `match` variable a bit annoying. I've attempted to implement something similar to Perl's method of creating new `$1`..`$9` variables for match groups and it looks like this:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python2.6\nimport re\n\nclass SRE_Match_Wrapper:\n    def __init__(self, match):\n        self.match = match\n\n    def __exit__(self, type, value, tb):\n        pass\n\n    def __enter__(self):\n        return self.match\n\n    def __getattr__(self, name):\n        if name == \"__exit__\":\n            return self.__exit__\n        elif name == \"__enter__\":\n            return self.__name__\n        else:\n            return getattr(self.match, name)\n\ndef rematch(pattern, inp):\n    matcher = re.compile(pattern)\n    x = SRE_Match_Wrapper(matcher.match(inp))\n    return x\n    return match\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Example:\n    with rematch(\"(\\d+)g\", \"123g\") as m:\n        if m:\n            print(m.group(1))\n\n    with rematch(\"(\\d+)g\", \"123\") as m:\n        if m:\n            print(m.group(1))\n```\n\nI'd like to simplify this even further to skip the execution of the `with` statement's code block, if there was no match. Any ideas on how to achieve this?"

        "content": "To simplify your approach and avoid the intermediate `match` variable, you can leverage Python's context managers and some creative use of exception handling. Here's a refined version of your code that skips the execution of the `with` statement's block if there is no match:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nclass MatchNotFound(Exception):\n    pass\n\nclass SRE_Match_Wrapper:\n    def __init__(self, match):\n        self.match = match\n\n    def __enter__(self):\n        if not self.match:\n            raise MatchNotFound\n        return self.match\n\n    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):\n        if exc_type is MatchNotFound:\n            return True  # Suppress the exception\n\ndef rematch(pattern, inp):\n    matcher = re.compile(pattern)\n    match = matcher.match(inp)\n    return SRE_Match_Wrapper(match)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    try:\n        with rematch(r\"(\\d+)g\", \"123g\") as m:\n            print(m.group(1))\n    except MatchNotFound:\n        pass\n\n    try:\n        with rematch(r\"(\\d+)g\", \"123\") as m:\n            print(m.group(1))\n    except MatchNotFound:\n        pass\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Exception Handling**: We use a custom exception (`MatchNotFound`) to handle cases when no match is found. The `__enter__` method raises this exception if the match is `None`.\n\n2. **Suppressing the Exception**: The `__exit__` method checks if the exception type is `MatchNotFound` and returns `True` to suppress it, effectively skipping the `with` block if no match is found.\n\n3. **Try-Except Block**: We wrap the `with` statement in a `try-except` block. If a match is not found, the `MatchNotFound` exception is raised and caught, and the block is skipped.\n\nThis approach allows you to cleanly handle cases with and without matches without needing an intermediate variable and skipping the block execution when there's no successful match."
