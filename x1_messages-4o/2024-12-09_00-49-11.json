Here is the structure of my dataframe:\n\n```\n2016-05-02 02:00:00+02:00    4.780\n2016-05-02 02:01:00+02:00    4.777\n2016-05-02 02:02:00+02:00    4.780\n2016-05-02 02:03:00+02:00    4.780\n2016-05-02 02:04:00+02:00    4.780\nName: closeAsk, dtype: float64\n```\n\nWhen I plot this data, I am seeing horizontal lines due to the presence of weekends in the dataset. I am looking for a way to remove the non-business days (weekends) from the dataframe. I am wondering if there's something similar to `df = df.BDays()` that I can use to achieve this."

        "content": "To remove non-business days (such as weekends) from your time series data in a Pandas DataFrame, you can use the Pandas `pd.to_datetime()` and `pd.bdate_range()` functions to filter your DataFrame. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. Convert the index to a DateTimeIndex if it's not already in that format.\n2. Use the `pd.bdate_range()` function to create a range of business days within the range of your dataframe.\n3. Reindex your DataFrame to include only these business days.\n\nHere's how you can do this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming the index is already a DateTimeIndex, if not, convert it\ndf.index = pd.to_datetime(df.index)\n\n# Create a business day range within the range of your dataframe\nbusiness_days = pd.bdate_range(start=df.index.min(), end=df.index.max())\n\n# Filter the dataframe to include only the business days\ndf_filtered = df[df.index.isin(business_days)]\n\n# Now df_filtered contains only the business days\n```\n\nThis will exclude the weekends (non-business days) from your DataFrame, and only data from business days will remain. You can then plot `df_filtered` to see the updated time series without horizontal lines for weekends."
