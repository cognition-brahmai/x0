        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering is because the TensorFlow version you are using doesn't have the `set_random_seed` function available in the `tf` module. This is common in TensorFlow 2.x or when there's a mismatch between the TensorFlow version and the code you're trying to run.\n\nHere's how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check TensorFlow Version**: First, confirm which version of TensorFlow you are using. You can do this by running:\n\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n   print(tf.__version__)\n   ```\n\n2. **Use Correct Function for TensorFlow Version**:\n   - If you're using TensorFlow 1.x, the function `tf.set_random_seed()` should be available. However, if you are on TensorFlow 2.x, you need to use `tf.compat.v1.set_random_seed()` because TensorFlow 2.x has some API changes.\n\n3. **Adjust Your Code**: Modify your code to be compatible with TensorFlow 2.x if that's the version you're using. Here's how you can change the code:\n\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n\n   def main():\n       # If you are using TensorFlow 2.x, use this line:\n       tf.compat.v1.set_random_seed(args.random_seed)\n       \n       # If you are using TensorFlow 1.x, use this line:\n       # tf.set_random_seed(args.random_seed)\n   \n   # rest of your code\n   ```\n\n4. **Downgrade TensorFlow (Optional)**: If your project must use TensorFlow 1.x, you can downgrade your TensorFlow version:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install tensorflow==1.15\n   ```\n\n   Make sure to adjust your code accordingly if you decide to downgrade.\n\n5. **Consider Migrating to TensorFlow 2.x**: If possible, consider upgrading your code to be compatible with TensorFlow 2.x. TensorFlow 2.x has many improvements, and migrating is often worth the effort.\n\nBy ensuring that your code and TensorFlow version are compatible, you should be able to resolve the `AttributeError` and proceed with running your script."
