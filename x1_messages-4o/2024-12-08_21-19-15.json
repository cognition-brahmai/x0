You can use the following Python program to find the longest palindrome in a list of words:\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(word):\n    # A function to check if a word is a palindrome\n    return word == word[::-1]\n\ndef longest_palindrome(word_list):\n    # Initialize a variable to store the longest palindrome found\n    longest = \"\"\n    \n    # Iterate through each word in the list\n    for word in word_list:\n        # Check if the word is a palindrome and longer than the current longest\n        if is_palindrome(word) and len(word) > len(longest):\n            longest = word\n            \n    return longest\n\n# Example usage:\nwords = [\"deified\", \"civic\", \"radar\", \"level\", \"rotor\", \"kayak\", \"reviver\", \"racecar\", \"madam\", \"refer\"]\nlongest_palindromic_word = longest_palindrome(words)\nprint(\"The longest palindrome in the list is:\", longest_palindromic_word)\n```\n\nThis program defines a helper function `is_palindrome` to check if a word is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse. The main function, `longest_palindrome`, iterates through the list of words and updates the longest palindrome found. Finally, it returns the longest palindrome. You can test it with different lists of words to see the results."
