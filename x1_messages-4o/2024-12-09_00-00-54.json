        "content": "The command you've provided has a slight misunderstanding in the way the wildcard and directory are used. To search for a string in all files within a directory and its subdirectories, and then refine the search to only certain file types, you can use the following commands:\n\n1. **Search for a string in all files within a directory and subdirectories:**\n\n   ```bash\n   grep -r \"hello\" /example\n   ```\n\n   This command will search recursively (`-r`) through all files in the `/example` directory and its subdirectories for the string \"hello\".\n\n2. **Search for a string only in files with a specific file extension:**\n\n   To search only in `.txt` files, you can combine `grep` with `find`:\n\n   ```bash\n   find /example -type f -name \"*.txt\" -exec grep \"hello\" {} +\n   ```\n\n   Here's a breakdown of this command:\n\n   - `find /example`: Starts the search in the `/example` directory.\n   - `-type f`: Ensures that only files are considered.\n   - `-name \"*.txt\"`: Filters the files to only those with the `.txt` extension.\n   - `-exec grep \"hello\" {} +`: Executes the `grep` command on each file found, searching for the string \"hello\". The `{}` is a placeholder for each file found, and the `+` at the end allows `find` to pass multiple files to `grep` at once, which is more efficient.\n\nAlternatively, you can use `grep` with `--include` to directly specify the file extension:\n\n```bash\ngrep -r --include=\"*.txt\" \"hello\" /example\n```\n\nThis approach is simpler and directly uses `grep` with the `--include` option to limit the search to files matching the specified pattern."
