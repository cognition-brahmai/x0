Here's an analysis of grammatical mistakes in the given sentence along with suggested fixes:\n\n| Sentence                    | Mistakes                               | Suggested Fixes                                     |\n|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| There is three mistakes.    | Subject-Verb Agreement, Numerical Error | There are three mistakes.                           |\n\nHere's the breakdown of the mistakes and fixes:\n\n1. **Subject-Verb Agreement**: The subject \"three mistakes\" is plural, so the verb should also be in the plural form. Hence, \"is\" should be corrected to \"are.\"\n\n2. **Numerical Error**: \"Three\" is a plural number, indicating more than one mistake, thus reinforcing the need for the plural verb \"are.\"\n\nBy making these corrections, the sentence becomes grammatically correct."
