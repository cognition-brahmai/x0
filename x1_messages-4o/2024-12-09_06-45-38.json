Here is the list:\n\n```python\ndfList = [df1, df2, df3, df4, df5, df6.....df18]\n```\n\nAll of the dataframes share a common ID column, which would make it easy to join them two at a time using pd.merge. However, I'm looking for a solution that would allow me to merge them all at once. Is there a way to do this?"

        "content": "Yes, you can merge all the dataframes in your list into a single dataframe by using the `functools.reduce` function in combination with `pd.merge`. This approach allows you to apply the `merge` operation sequentially across all dataframes in your list. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom functools import reduce\n\n# Assuming dfList is your list of dataframes\ndfList = [df1, df2, df3, df4, df5, df6, ..., df18]\n\n# Merge all dataframes using reduce and pd.merge\nmerged_df = reduce(lambda left, right: pd.merge(left, right, on='ID'), dfList)\n\n# Now, merged_df is the combined dataframe\n```\n\nIn this code snippet:\n\n- `reduce` applies a function (in this case, a lambda function performing `pd.merge`) cumulatively to the items of the iterable (your list of dataframes), from left to right, so as to reduce the list to a single dataframe.\n- The `on='ID'` specifies that the merge should happen based on the 'ID' column, common to all dataframes.\n\nMake sure to replace `'ID'` with the actual name of the common column that you want to merge on, if it's different. Also, ensure all dataframes have this column to avoid errors during the merge process."
