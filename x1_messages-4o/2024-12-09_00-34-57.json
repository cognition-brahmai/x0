Here's a simple way to do it in Python:\n\n```python\ndef append_unique_number(number_list, number):\n    if number not in number_list:\n        number_list.append(number)\n        print(f\"{number} added to the list.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"{number} is already in the list.\")\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nappend_unique_number(numbers, 3)  # Output: 3 is already in the list.\nappend_unique_number(numbers, 6)  # Output: 6 added to the list.\nprint(numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nIn this function, `append_unique_number`, we check if the `number` is not in `number_list` before appending it. If it's already in the list, we simply print a message indicating that the number is already present. If not, we append the number to the list and print a message confirming the addition."
