        "content": "In Python 3, the distinction between `raw_input()` and `input()` that existed in Python 2 no longer applies because `raw_input()` was removed. Here's how these functions differ:\n\n1. **Python 2:**\n   - `raw_input()`: This function reads a line from input, converts it to a string, and returns it. In other words, it takes input from the user and returns it as a string.\n   - `input()`: This function first evaluates the input as a Python expression and then returns the result. It can be potentially dangerous if you're not expecting or handling arbitrary code execution.\n\n2. **Python 3:**\n   - `input()`: In Python 3, `input()` behaves like `raw_input()` from Python 2. It reads input from the user, converts it to a string, and returns it. This means it no longer evaluates the input as a Python expression by default, making it safer to use for standard input purposes.\n\nIf you want to evaluate user input as an expression in Python 3, you would need to use `eval()` on the result of `input()`, but this should be done with caution due to security risks."
