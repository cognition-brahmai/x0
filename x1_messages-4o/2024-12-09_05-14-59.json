However, during the installation, I encounter an error: \"AttributeError: module 'sipbuild.api' has no attribute 'prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel'\". Interestingly, the installation works fine for the latest version of PyQt5 (5.15.2), but this program specifically requires 5.15.0. I am currently using the latest version of pip. What could be the root cause of this issue?\n\nHere is the command output:\n```\nCollecting PyQt5==5.15.0\n  Using cached PyQt5-5.15.0.tar.gz (3.3 MB)\n  Installing build dependencies ... done\n  Getting requirements to build wheel ... done\n    Preparing wheel metadata ... error\n    ERROR: Command errored out with exit status 1:\n     command: 'c:\\users\\mshal\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python39\\python.exe' 'C:\\Users\\mshal\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python\\Python39\\site-packages\\pip\\_vendor\\pep517\\_in_process.py' prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel 'C:\\Users\\mshal\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmp41s11ev6'\n         cwd: C:\\Users\\mshal\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\pip-install-sfw90hvc\\pyqt5_e2cc46859b554da7b84798abae5378ba\n    Complete output (31 lines):\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n      File \"C:\\Users\\mshal\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python\\Python39\\site-packages\\pip\\_vendor\\pep517\\_in_process.py\", line 126, in prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel\n        hook = backend.prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel\n    AttributeError: module 'sipbuild.api' has no attribute 'prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel'\n    ...\n    ERROR: Command errored out with exit status 1: 'c:\\users\\mshal\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python39\\python.exe' 'C:\\Users\\mshal\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python\\Python39\\site-packages\\pip\\_vendor\\pep517\\_in_process.py' prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel 'C:\\Users\\mshal\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmp41s11ev6' Check the logs for full command output.\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering with PyQt5 version 5.15.0 is related to the build system and the version of the `sip` tool used during the process. The `sip` package is responsible for generating Python bindings for C++ libraries, such as Qt, and it appears that there may be compatibility issues with certain versions of `sip`, Python, and PyQt5.\n\nHere are a few steps to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check and Downgrade `sip` Version**: The version of `sip` might not be compatible with PyQt5 5.15.0. You can try downgrading `sip` to a version that is known to work with PyQt5 5.15.0. First, you can uninstall the current version of `sip`:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall sip\n   ```\n\n   Then, install a compatible version, such as 4.19.24:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install sip==4.19.24\n   ```\n\n2. **Use a Virtual Environment**: It's good practice to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other packages and dependencies. You can create and activate a virtual environment using the following commands:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `myenv\\Scripts\\activate`\n   ```\n\n3. **Install the Required Version of PyQt5**: Within the virtual environment, try installing PyQt5 5.15.0 again:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install PyQt5==5.15.0\n   ```\n\n4. **Check Python Version**: Ensure that you're using a compatible version of Python. Sometimes, older versions of PyQt5 may not support the latest versions of Python. You might need to use a slightly older version of Python that is compatible with PyQt5 5.15.0.\n\n5. **Upgrade `setuptools` and `wheel`**: Ensure you have the latest versions of `setuptools` and `wheel`, as they can impact the build process:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel\n   ```\n\nIf the issue persists, consider checking PyQt5's release notes or documentation for any specific instructions regarding dependencies for version 5.15.0."
