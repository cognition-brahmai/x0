        "content": "To classify a sentence as either a question or an imperative in programming, you can use natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Here's a basic approach to get you started:\n\n1. **Identify Sentence Structure**:\n   - **Question**: Generally ends with a question mark (`?`) and often starts with words like who, what, where, when, why, how, do, does, is, etc.\n   - **Imperative**: Usually starts with a verb and gives a command or request. It often lacks a subject.\n\n2. **Use NLP Libraries**:\n   - Libraries like NLTK, spaCy, or TextBlob in Python can help you analyze sentence structure.\n\n3. **Regex for Quick Checks**:\n   - Use regular expressions to detect question marks or interrogative words at the beginning of the sentence for questions.\n\n4. **Part-of-Speech Tagging**:\n   - Use NLP libraries to tag parts of speech. Imperative sentences often start with a verb.\n\n5. **Syntax Parsing**:\n   - Parse the sentence to understand its grammatical structure. Questions often have a different structure compared to imperatives.\n\nHere's a simple example using Python and NLTK:\n\n```python\nimport nltk\n\ndef classify_sentence(sentence):\n    # Tokenize and tag parts of speech\n    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(sentence)\n    pos_tags = nltk.pos_tag(tokens)\n\n    # Check for question mark or interrogative words\n    if sentence.strip().endswith('?') or pos_tags[0][0].lower() in {'who', 'what', 'where', 'when', 'why', 'how', 'do', 'does', 'is', 'are', 'can', 'will'}:\n        return \"Question\"\n    \n    # Check if the sentence starts with a verb (imperative)\n    if pos_tags[0][1].startswith('VB'):\n        return \"Imperative\"\n    \n    return \"Unknown\"\n\n# Example usage\nsentence1 = \"Can you help me?\"\nsentence2 = \"Close the door.\"\n\nprint(classify_sentence(sentence1))  # Output: Question\nprint(classify_sentence(sentence2))  # Output: Imperative\n```\n\nThis is a simplified example and may not cover all edge cases, but it gives a starting point. For more accuracy, consider using a machine learning model trained on labeled data to classify sentences."
