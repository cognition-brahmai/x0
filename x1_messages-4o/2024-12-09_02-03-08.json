The class I have is as follows:\n\n```python\nclass Node(object):\n    def __init__(self, val, left=None, right=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n```\n\nI converted the class into a named tuple like this:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nNode = namedtuple('Node', 'val left right')\n```\n\nHowever, I am encountering an issue. The original class allowed me to just pass a value and it took care of the default values for the named/keyword arguments. This is how I utilized it:\n\n```python\nclass BinaryTree(object):\n    def __init__(self, val):\n        self.root = Node(val)\n```\n\nThis doesn't work with the refactored named tuple as it expects all the fields to be passed. I can replace the occurrences of `Node(val)` to `Node(val, None, None)` but I prefer not to. Is there a method to make this rewrite successful without adding a lot of code complexity or should I proceed with the \"search and replace\" approach?"

        "content": "When you replace a class with a named tuple, you lose the ability to easily set default values for the fields. However, you can still achieve the desired functionality by defining a factory function or a helper function that provides default values for the `left` and `right` fields. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import namedtuple\n\n# Define the named tuple\nNode = namedtuple('Node', 'val left right')\n\n# Create a factory function to handle default values\ndef create_node(val, left=None, right=None):\n    return Node(val, left, right)\n\n# Example usage in a BinaryTree class\nclass BinaryTree(object):\n    def __init__(self, val):\n        self.root = create_node(val)\n\n# Testing the functionality\ntree = BinaryTree(10)\nprint(tree.root)  # Output: Node(val=10, left=None, right=None)\n```\n\nIn this solution, `create_node` serves as a helper function that allows you to initialize a `Node` with default values for `left` and `right`. This way, you can continue using `Node(val)` without needing to specify the default values explicitly every time. This approach keeps your code clean and avoids the need for extensive search and replace operations."
