        "content": "The error message \"TypeError: required field 'lineno' missing from alias\" you're encountering is indeed a known issue that often arises due to compatibility problems between certain versions of Python and libraries like `pytest`. This issue specifically relates to changes in the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) module between Python versions, which can affect how some libraries handle source code introspection.\n\nHere are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Update pytest and dependencies:**\n   Make sure you're using the latest version of `pytest` and its related packages. You can update them using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade pytest\n   pip install --upgrade pytest-astropy  # If you're using astropy-related plugins\n   ```\n\n2. **Check compatibility:**\n   Ensure that all the plugins and dependencies you are using are compatible with Python 3.10. Some libraries might still be in the process of updating their code to be compatible with the latest Python release.\n\n3. **Review your code for compatibility:**\n   There might be parts of your own test code or configuration files that need adjustments to accommodate changes in Python 3.10. Look out for any deprecated or changed syntax in your tests.\n\n4. **Search for library-specific issues:**\n   Sometimes, the issue lies within a specific library that `pytest` or your code uses. Check the issue trackers of these libraries for any reported issues and potential fixes or workarounds.\n\n5. **Use virtual environments:**\n   It\u2019s a good practice to use virtual environments for testing different Python versions. This can help isolate potential version-specific issues.\n\n6. **Consider downgrading Python:**\n   If you need an immediate workaround and none of the above solutions work, consider using Python 3.9 for running your tests until a fix is available for Python 3.10.\n\n7. **Report the issue:**\n   If you believe this is a bug that hasn\u2019t been addressed yet, consider reporting it to the `pytest` issue tracker with details of your setup, error messages, and any relevant code snippets.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and hopefully resolve the compatibility issue you're facing with Python 3.10 and `pytest`."
