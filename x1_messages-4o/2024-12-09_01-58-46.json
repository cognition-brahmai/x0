        "content": "I need to write a function named `mssl()` which takes a list of integers as an input and returns the sum of the maximum sum sublist from the input list. The maximum sum sublist is a sublist of the input list whose sum of entries is the largest. If the list is empty or all elements are negative, the function should return 0. For example, for the list `[4, -2, -8, 5, -2, 7, 7, 2, -6, 5]`, the maximum sum sublist is `[5, -2, 7, 7, 2]` and the sum of its entries is `19`. I tried to implement this function but it doesn't produce the expected result. Here is my current code:\n\n```python\ndef mssl(x):\n    ' list ==> int '\n    res = 0\n    for a in x:\n        if a >= 0:\n            res = sum(x)\n        return res\n    else:\n        return 0\n```\n\nHow can I correctly implement this function?"

        "content": "To correctly implement the `mssl()` function, we need to use an algorithm that efficiently finds the maximum sum sublist. One widely used algorithm for this purpose is Kadane's Algorithm. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\ndef mssl(x):\n    # Check if the list is empty, return 0\n    if not x:\n        return 0\n\n    # Initialize max_current and max_global with the first element of the list\n    max_current = max_global = x[0]\n\n    # Iterate over the list starting from the second element\n    for i in range(1, len(x)):\n        # Update max_current to be the maximum of the current element alone or the current element plus the previous max_current\n        max_current = max(x[i], max_current + x[i])\n        \n        # Update max_global to be the maximum value between itself and max_current\n        if max_current > max_global:\n            max_global = max_current\n\n    # If the maximum global sum is negative, return 0 as per the problem statement\n    return max(max_global, 0)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(mssl([4, -2, -8, 5, -2, 7, 7, 2, -6, 5]))  # Output: 19\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We start by assuming the first element is the maximum sum sublist (`max_current` and `max_global`).\n\n2. **Iteration**: We iterate over the list starting from the second element. For each element, we update `max_current`, which keeps track of the maximum sum of the sublist ending at the current position. We do this by choosing the maximum between the current element alone or adding it to the previous `max_current`.\n\n3. **Update Global Maximum**: We update `max_global` whenever `max_current` exceeds it. This ensures that `max_global` always holds the maximum sum encountered so far.\n\n4. **Handling Negatives**: Finally, if the entire list contains only negative numbers, according to our problem statement, we should return 0. Therefore, we return the maximum between `max_global` and 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function efficiently finds the maximum sum sublist in linear time complexity O(n)."
