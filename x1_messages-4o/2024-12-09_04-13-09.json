However, when I plot the ellipse after plotting the image, xlim and ylim seem to increase, resulting in an unwanted border. Here is the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nself.dpi = 100\nself.fig = Figure((6.0, 6.0), dpi=self.dpi)\nself.canvas = FigureCanvas(self.fig)\nself.canvas.setMinimumSize(800, 400)\nself.cax = None\nself.axes = self.fig.add_subplot(111)\nself.axes.imshow(channel1, interpolation=\"nearest\")\nself.canvas.draw()\nself.axes.plot(dat[0], dat[1], \"b-\")\n```\n\nI've tried setting the limits before and after calling \"plot\", but it doesn't seem to have an effect:\n\n```python\n# get limits after calling imshow\nxlim, ylim = pylab.xlim(), pylab.ylim()\n...\n# set limits before/after calling plot\nself.axes.set_xlim(xlim)\nself.axes.set_ylim(ylim)\n```\n\nHow can I force the plot function not to increase the existing figure limits?"

        "content": "When you plot additional elements such as lines or ellipses on an image using Matplotlib's `imshow`, the `plot` command can indeed adjust the limits of the axes to accommodate the new plot elements. To prevent this behavior and maintain the axis limits defined by the image, you can use a few strategies. Here's a refined approach to ensure that the `imshow` limits are maintained after plotting on the axes:\n\n1. **Get Axis Limits After `imshow`:** First, capture the limits immediately after you call `imshow`.\n\n2. **Restore Axis Limits After `plot`:** After plotting the additional elements, reset the limits to the ones captured initially.\n\nHere's how you can implement these steps in your code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib.figure import Figure\nfrom matplotlib.backends.backend_agg import FigureCanvasAgg as FigureCanvas\n\n# Assuming 'channel1' is defined and contains your image data\n# Assuming 'dat' is defined and contains the data for the ellipse or line\n\nself.dpi = 100\nself.fig = Figure((6.0, 6.0), dpi=self.dpi)\nself.canvas = FigureCanvas(self.fig)\nself.canvas.setMinimumSize(800, 400)\nself.axes = self.fig.add_subplot(111)\n\n# Display the image\nself.axes.imshow(channel1, interpolation=\"nearest\")\n\n# Capture the current axis limits\nxlim, ylim = self.axes.get_xlim(), self.axes.get_ylim()\n\n# Plot additional elements, such as a line or ellipse\nself.axes.plot(dat[0], dat[1], \"b-\")\n\n# Restore the axis limits to those of the image\nself.axes.set_xlim(xlim)\nself.axes.set_ylim(ylim)\n\n# Draw the canvas\nself.canvas.draw()\n```\n\n### Additional Tips:\n\n- **Use `aspect='auto'`:** If you still encounter issues, ensure that the aspect ratio of the plot does not fix itself to the data by setting `aspect='auto'` in `imshow` if it isn't already.\n\n- **Adjusting Aspect Ratio:** If the aspect ratio is causing issues, consider using `self.axes.set_aspect('auto')` to allow the plot to adjust freely.\n\n- **Tight Layout:** Ensure there are no layout issues by calling `self.fig.tight_layout()` after plotting, but before drawing the canvas.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to maintain the desired limits on your image plot when overlaying additional elements."
