        "content": "To create a Java class to represent a rectangle with fields for width and height, and methods to calculate the area and perimeter, you can follow this structure:\n\n```java\npublic class Rectangle {\n    // Fields for width and height\n    private double width;\n    private double height;\n\n    // Constructor to initialize width and height\n    public Rectangle(double width, double height) {\n        this.width = width;\n        this.height = height;\n    }\n\n    // Getter and Setter for width\n    public double getWidth() {\n        return width;\n    }\n\n    public void setWidth(double width) {\n        this.width = width;\n    }\n\n    // Getter and Setter for height\n    public double getHeight() {\n        return height;\n    }\n\n    public void setHeight(double height) {\n        this.height = height;\n    }\n\n    // Method to calculate the area of the rectangle\n    public double calculateArea() {\n        return width * height;\n    }\n\n    // Method to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle\n    public double calculatePerimeter() {\n        return 2 * (width + height);\n    }\n\n    // Main method for testing\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Create a Rectangle object\n        Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle(5, 10);\n\n        // Calculate and print the area\n        double area = rectangle.calculateArea();\n        System.out.println(\"Area: \" + area);\n\n        // Calculate and print the perimeter\n        double perimeter = rectangle.calculatePerimeter();\n        System.out.println(\"Perimeter: \" + perimeter);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Key Components:\n\n1. **Fields**: `width` and `height` are declared as private fields to encapsulate the rectangle's properties.\n\n2. **Constructor**: Initializes `width` and `height` when a new `Rectangle` object is created.\n\n3. **Getters and Setters**: Provide access to modify and retrieve the values of `width` and `height`.\n\n4. **Methods**:\n   - `calculateArea()`: Returns the area of the rectangle by multiplying `width` and `height`.\n   - `calculatePerimeter()`: Returns the perimeter by calculating `2 * (width + height)`.\n\n5. **Main Method**: Demonstrates how to create a `Rectangle` object and use its methods to calculate area and perimeter.\n\nYou can run this code in a Java development environment to test its functionality."
