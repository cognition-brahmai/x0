This will increment the value by 1.\n   - Drag the fill handle (small square at the bottom-right corner of the selected cell) of cell A3 down to cell A102. This will fill the column with integers from 0 to 100.\n\n3. **Calculate the Sum:**\n   - In cell B2, enter the formula `=17+A2`.\n   - Drag the fill handle of cell B2 down to cell B102. This will calculate the sum for each corresponding value of x.\n\n4. **Review Your Table:**\n   - You should now see the complete table with columns \"x\" and \"Sum\", where the \"Sum\" column shows the result of adding 17 to each integer from 0 to 100.\n\nThis setup will automatically calculate and display the sum of 17 and each integer between 0 and 100 in the specified format."
