Here's a coding puzzle for you to solve using your reasoning skills.\nYour task is to create a code in Ruby programming language that takes two inputs X and Y and produces an output based on the following rules:\n- If X is a multiple of 3, output the product of X and Y.\n- If X is an odd number greater than 1, output the square of the difference between X and Y.\n- If X is a prime number, output the square root of the sum of X and Y.\n- If X is none of the above, output the absolute difference between X and Y.\nCan you crack this puzzle? Good luck!"

        "content": "Sure, let's tackle this coding puzzle by implementing a Ruby solution based on the given rules. Here's the code:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'prime'\nrequire 'mathn'\n\ndef puzzle_solution(x, y)\n  if x % 3 == 0\n    # X is a multiple of 3\n    return x * y\n  elsif x.odd? && x > 1\n    # X is an odd number greater than 1\n    return (x - y) ** 2\n  elsif x.prime?\n    # X is a prime number\n    return Math.sqrt(x + y)\n  else\n    # If X is none of the above\n    return (x - y).abs\n  end\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nx = 5\ny = 3\nputs puzzle_solution(x, y)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Multiple of 3**: We check if `x % 3 == 0` to determine if X is a multiple of 3. If true, we return the product `x * y`.\n- **Odd number greater than 1**: We check if `x.odd? && x > 1` to determine if X is an odd number greater than 1. If true, we return the square of the difference `(x - y) ** 2`.\n- **Prime number**: We use `x.prime?` to check if X is a prime number. If true, we return the square root of the sum `Math.sqrt(x + y)`.\n- **None of the above**: If none of the above conditions are met, we return the absolute difference `(x - y).abs`.\n\nThis code will correctly output the result based on the specified rules. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!"
