The line I'm looking at is `from ._multiprocessing import win32, Connection, PipeConnection`. This differs from the usual statement like `from _multiprocessing import win32, Connection, PipeConnection`, where there's no period before `_multiprocessing`. Can anyone explain why this period is used and what it means?"

        "content": "In Python, the period (`.`) in an import statement has a specific meaning related to relative imports. Relative imports are used to import modules relative to the current module's location in the package hierarchy.\n\nIn the line you've encountered:\n\n```python\nfrom ._multiprocessing import win32, Connection, PipeConnection\n```\n\nthe period (`.`) before `_multiprocessing` indicates a relative import. Here's what it signifies:\n\n1. **Single Period (`.`):** A single period refers to the current package. So, when you see `from ._multiprocessing`, it means \"import from the `_multiprocessing` module located in the same package as the current module.\"\n\n2. **Usage Context:** This is often used when you're working within a package, and you want to import another module or submodule from the same package. It prevents the need to specify the full package path and makes it easier to reorganize the package without changing the import statements.\n\n3. **Contrast with Absolute Import:** Without the period, as in `from _multiprocessing import...`, it suggests an absolute import. This means Python will look for the `_multiprocessing` module starting from the top-level namespace, rather than relative to the current module's location.\n\nRelative imports are particularly useful for maintaining modular code within larger packages, where the module structure might change, but the relative positioning of the modules remains consistent. \n\nHowever, keep in mind that relative imports can only be used within a package context. Attempting to run a module that uses relative imports as a standalone script can cause issues. To ensure proper functionality in such cases, you might need to run it with the package context or convert the imports to absolute imports."
