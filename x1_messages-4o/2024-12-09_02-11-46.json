I am currently evaluating different python plotting libraries and I am not satisfied with the performance of Matplotlib. I am modifying an example from SciPy examples and it is giving me only around 8 frames per second. Is there any way to speed up this process or should I consider a different plotting library? Below is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nfrom pylab import *\nimport time\n\nion()\nfig = figure()\nax1 = fig.add_subplot(611)\nax2 = fig.add_subplot(612)\nax3 = fig.add_subplot(613)\nax4 = fig.add_subplot(614)\nax5 = fig.add_subplot(615)\nax6 = fig.add_subplot(616)\n\nx = arange(0,2*pi,0.01)\ny = sin(x)\nline1, = ax1.plot(x, y, 'r-')\nline2, = ax2.plot(x, y, 'g-')\nline3, = ax3.plot(x, y, 'y-')\nline4, = ax4.plot(x, y, 'm-')\nline5, = ax5.plot(x, y, 'k-')\nline6, = ax6.plot(x, y, 'p-')\n\n# turn off interactive plotting - speeds things up by 1 Frame / second\nplt.ioff()\n\ntstart = time.time()               # for profiling\nfor i in arange(1, 200):\n    line1.set_ydata(sin(x+i/10.0))  # update the data\n    line2.set_ydata(sin(2*x+i/10.0))\n    line3.set_ydata(sin(3*x+i/10.0))\n    line4.set_ydata(sin(4*x+i/10.0))\n    line5.set_ydata(sin(5*x+i/10.0))\n    line6.set_ydata(sin(6*x+i/10.0))\n    draw()                         # redraw the canvas\n\nprint 'FPS:' , 200/(time.time()-tstart)\n```"

        "content": "Matplotlib is a versatile library, but it can be slow for real-time or high frame-rate plotting because it is primarily designed for static plots. There are several ways to optimize your code to improve performance:\n\n1. **Use `blit` for faster updates**: `blit` can significantly improve performance by only redrawing the parts of the canvas that have changed. Not all backends support this, so you need to check if your current backend does.\n\n2. **Reduce the number of points**: If you're plotting high-resolution data, try downsampling to reduce the number of points being plotted.\n\n3. **Update only what is necessary**: Instead of updating all lines every frame, update only those that have changed.\n\n4. **Consider other libraries**: If performance is still an issue, other libraries like `Plotly`, `Bokeh`, or `PyQtGraph` might offer better performance for interactive or real-time plotting.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use `blit`:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport time\n\n# Interactive mode off\nplt.ioff()\n\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(6, 1, figsize=(6, 8))\nx = np.arange(0, 2*np.pi, 0.01)\ny = np.sin(x)\n\nlines = []\nfor ax in axs:\n    line, = ax.plot(x, y, 'r-')\n    lines.append(line)\n    ax.set_ylim(-1.5, 1.5)  # Set y-limits for all subplots for better blit performance\n\n# Use tight layout to avoid overlap\nfig.tight_layout()\n\n# Draw the figure first\nfig.canvas.draw()\n\n# Cache the background\nbackgrounds = [fig.canvas.copy_from_bbox(ax.bbox) for ax in axs]\n\ntstart = time.time()\nfor i in np.arange(1, 200):\n    # Restore the background\n    for bg, ax, line in zip(backgrounds, axs, lines):\n        fig.canvas.restore_region(bg)\n        line.set_ydata(np.sin(x + i / 10.0 * (axs.index(ax) + 1)))  # Update line data\n        ax.draw_artist(line)  # Redraw just the line\n        fig.canvas.blit(ax.bbox)  # Blit the updated area back to the screen\n\n    fig.canvas.flush_events()  # For some backends, needed to update the display\n\nprint('FPS:', 200 / (time.time() - tstart))\n```\n\nThis example modifies your code to use `blit` to improve performance. If you still find that performance is not adequate, you might want to explore other libraries specifically designed for fast plotting."
