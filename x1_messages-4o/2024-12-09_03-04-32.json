I currently use urllib.pathname2url to convert the pathname path from the local syntax for a path to the form used in the path component of a URL. However, this does not produce a complete URL. I have a function, but am unsure if I should use sys.getfilesystemencoding() and whether I should prepend file:// or file: to the URL.\n\nHere is my current function:\n```python\ndef path2url(path):\n    \"\"\"Return file:// URL from a filename.\"\"\"\n    path = os.path.abspath(path)\n    if isinstance(path, unicode):\n        path = path.encode('utf8')\n    return 'file:' + urlparse.pathname2url(path)\n```"

        "content": "To convert a filename to a `file://` URL in a cross-platform way that is compatible with WeasyPrint's API, you should consider the following:\n\n1. Use `os.path.abspath()` to ensure the path is absolute.\n2. Use `urllib.parse.quote()` instead of `urllib.pathname2url()` for Python 3, as `pathname2url()` is not available in Python 3.\n3. Use `os.path.normpath()` to normalize the path.\n4. Always prepend `file://` to the URL.\n5. Handle any encoding issues by explicitly specifying UTF-8, assuming you are working with UTF-8 encoded paths.\n\nHere's a revised version of your function that should work across platforms and with Python 3:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport urllib.parse\n\ndef path2url(path):\n    \"\"\"Return file:// URL from a filename.\"\"\"\n    # Ensure the path is absolute and normalized\n    path = os.path.abspath(os.path.normpath(path))\n    \n    # Encode the path in UTF-8 and quote it\n    quoted_path = urllib.parse.quote(path)\n    \n    # Build the file:// URL\n    url = 'file://' + quoted_path\n    \n    return url\n\n# Usage example\nfilename = \"example.txt\"\nfile_url = path2url(filename)\nprint(file_url)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **`os.path.abspath()` and `os.path.normpath()`**: Ensures that the path is both absolute and normalized across different operating systems.\n- **`urllib.parse.quote()`**: Safely encodes special characters in the path.\n- **`file://` Prefix**: Always use `file://` as it is the standard scheme for file URLs.\n\nThis function should handle most typical use cases for converting file paths to URLs, including those with spaces or special characters."
