Here is the code I'm trying to run:\n\n```python\nclass Foo:\n    def __init__(self, key :str) -> None:\n        self.key = key\n\n    def __eq__(self, other :Foo) -> bool:\n        return self.key == other.key\n\nprint('should be true: ', Foo('abc') == Foo('abc'))\nprint('should be false: ', Foo('abc') == Foo('def'))\n```\n\nWhen I run it, I get the following error:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"class_own_type.py\", line 1, in <module>\n    class Foo:\n  File \"class_own_type.py\", line 5, in Foo\n    def __eq__(self, other :Foo) -> bool:\nNameError: name 'Foo' is not defined\n```\n\nAdditionally, when I check the code with `mypy`, I get the following error:\n\n```python\nclass_own_type.py:5: error: Argument 1 of \"__eq__\" incompatible with supertype \"object\"\n```\n\nCan anyone help me correct this code so it's valid for both Python and `mypy`?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that Python's class definitions are processed in one pass, so when you're defining the `__eq__` method, the `Foo` type isn't fully defined yet and therefore isn't recognized. To fix this, you can use a forward reference by wrapping the type in quotes. Here's the corrected code:\n\n```python\nclass Foo:\n    def __init__(self, key: str) -> None:\n        self.key = key\n\n    def __eq__(self, other: 'Foo') -> bool:  # Use a forward reference for Foo\n        return self.key == other.key\n\nprint('should be true: ', Foo('abc') == Foo('abc'))\nprint('should be false: ', Foo('abc') == Foo('def'))\n```\n\nIn this code, the type hint for `other` in the `__eq__` method is given as a string `'Foo'`, which Python interprets as a forward reference to the `Foo` class. \n\nAdditionally, Python 3.7 and later support `from __future__ import annotations`, which allows all annotations to be automatically treated as forward references, eliminating the need for quotes. If you're using Python 3.7 or later, you can add this import at the top of your file:\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import annotations\n\nclass Foo:\n    def __init__(self, key: str) -> None:\n        self.key = key\n\n    def __eq__(self, other: Foo) -> bool:  # Now you can use Foo directly\n        return self.key == other.key\n\nprint('should be true: ', Foo('abc') == Foo('abc'))\nprint('should be false: ', Foo('abc') == Foo('def'))\n```\n\nThis approach will also work seamlessly with `mypy`."
