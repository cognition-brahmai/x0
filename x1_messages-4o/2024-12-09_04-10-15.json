For instance, the expression should match '123456678' since there is a double '6', but it shouldn't match '1234566678', since there are no doubles with different surrounding numbers. I have attempted to make this regex: `^.*([^1]11[^1]).*$` , which works only with '1', and as long as the double is not at the start or end of the string. I am aware that I can use `[0-9]` instead of the '1's, but the problem is having all these digits to be the same. I would appreciate any assistance on how to solve this."

        "content": "To create a regular expression that matches two identical digits adjacent to each other, with different digits before and after the pair, you can use capturing groups and backreferences. Here's a regex pattern that should work for your requirement:\n\n```\n(?<!\\d)(\\d)(\\d)\\2(?!\\2)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of how this regex works:\n\n- `(?<!\\d)`: This is a negative lookbehind that ensures the character before the match is not a digit. This prevents a match from happening if the pair is at the start of the string or if there are more than two identical digits in a row.\n  \n- `(\\d)(\\d)`: This captures two consecutive digits. The first `(\\d)` captures any digit and the second `(\\d)` captures the same digit as the first one.\n\n- `\\2`: This is a backreference that matches the same digit captured by the second capturing group `(\\d)`.\n\n- `(?!\\2)`: This is a negative lookahead that ensures the character following the matched pair is not the same as the pair. This ensures that the pair is not part of a longer sequence of identical digits.\n\nThis pattern should correctly match sequences like '123456678' where '66' is the only pair of identical digits with different surrounding numbers and will not match sequences like '1234566678', where '66' is part of a longer sequence of identical digits '666'.\n\nYou can use this pattern in your favorite regex tool or programming language that supports regex, such as Python, JavaScript, or others. Remember that the lookbehind `(?<!\\d)` and lookahead `(?!\\2)` might need to be adjusted based on the specific regex flavor you are using, as some have different capabilities or syntax."
