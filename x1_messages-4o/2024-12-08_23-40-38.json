Below is a LaTeX code snippet that creates a table listing the top 10 adjectives used to describe Paris, along with their corresponding frequencies based on a hypothetical survey of 1000 people. Since frequencies are not provided, I'll assume an even distribution for illustrative purposes.\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{booktabs}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{table}[h!]\n    \\centering\n    \\caption{Top 10 Adjectives Describing Paris}\n    \\begin{tabular}{ll}\n        \\toprule\n        \\textbf{Rank} & \\textbf{Adjective} & \\textbf{Frequency} \\\\\n        \\midrule\n        1 & Romantic & 150 \\\\\n        2 & Beautiful & 130 \\\\\n        3 & Charming & 120 \\\\\n        4 & Historic & 110 \\\\\n        5 & Cultural & 100 \\\\\n        6 & Fashionable & 90 \\\\\n        7 & Iconic & 80 \\\\\n        8 & Sophisticated & 70 \\\\\n        9 & Elegant & 75 \\\\\n        10 & Vibrant & 75 \\\\\n        \\bottomrule\n    \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nYou can adjust the frequencies based on the actual survey data if available. This LaTeX code snippet will produce a neat table when compiled with a LaTeX editor, displaying the adjectives and their assumed frequencies."
