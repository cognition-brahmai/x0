        "content": "Of course! To calculate the distance between two points in a 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, you can use the distance formula. The distance \\( d \\) between two points \\((x_1, y_1, z_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2, z_2)\\) is given by:\n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2} \\]\n\nHere's a Python function that implements this formula:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_distance(point1, point2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the distance between two points in 3D space.\n\n    :param point1: A tuple (x1, y1, z1) representing the first point.\n    :param point2: A tuple (x2, y2, z2) representing the second point.\n    :return: The distance between the two points.\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1, z1 = point1\n    x2, y2, z2 = point2\n    \n    distance = math.sqrt((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2 + (z2 - z1) ** 2)\n    return distance\n\n# Example usage:\npoint1 = (1, 2, 3)\npoint2 = (4, 5, 6)\nprint(\"Distance:\", calculate_distance(point1, point2))\n```\n\nThis function takes two tuples as arguments, each representing the coordinates of a point in 3D space, and returns the distance between them. You can test the function with different points to see how it works."
