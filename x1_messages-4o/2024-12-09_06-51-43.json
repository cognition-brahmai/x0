I am trying to load these files with Python but I seem to run out of memory. Python gives me a MemoryError. It appears that json.load() calls json.loads(f.read()), which tries to dump the entire file into memory first, which is not feasible due to the size of the files. How can I solve this issue in a clean way without requiring efficiency? Here is the code I am currently using:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport json\n\nprint datetime.now()\n\nf = open('file.json', 'r')\njson.load(f)\nf.close()\n\nprint datetime.now()\n```"

        "content": "When dealing with large JSON files, loading the entire file into memory with `json.load()` is not feasible due to memory constraints. Instead, you can use a library like `ijson` that allows for iterative parsing of JSON data. This way, you can process the JSON file in a streaming manner, which is much more memory efficient. Here's how you can modify your code to use `ijson`:\n\n```python\nimport ijson\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nprint(datetime.now())\n\n# Open the large JSON file\nwith open('file.json', 'r') as f:\n    # Use ijson to parse the file incrementally\n    parser = ijson.parse(f)\n    for prefix, event, value in parser:\n        # Process each JSON item here\n        # For example, if handling an array of objects:\n        if prefix == 'item':\n            # Do something with the value\n            print(value)\n\nprint(datetime.now())\n```\n\nIn this code, `ijson.parse(f)` returns an iterator that yields events for each JSON item in the file. You can then handle each item as it is parsed without needing to load the entire file into memory at once. Adjust the processing logic inside the loop according to the structure of your JSON file."
