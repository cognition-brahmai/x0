Below are the steps to create a simple Express.js application for this purpose:\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Your Project\n\n1. **Initialize a New Node.js Project**\n\n   First, create a new directory for your project and initialize it with npm:\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir sum-api\n   cd sum-api\n   npm init -y\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Express.js**\n\n   Install Express.js as a dependency:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install express\n   ```\n\n### Step 2: Create the Express.js Application\n\n1. **Create a New JavaScript File**\n\n   Create a new file named `app.js` to write your Express server code:\n\n   ```bash\n   touch app.js\n   ```\n\n2. **Write the Server Code**\n\n   Open `app.js` in your text editor and add the following code to set up a basic Express server with a route to calculate the sum:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const express = require('express');\n   const app = express();\n   const port = 3000;\n\n   // Middleware to parse JSON request bodies\n   app.use(express.json());\n\n   // Route to calculate the sum of two numbers\n   app.post('/sum', (req, res) => {\n     const { num1, num2 } = req.body;\n\n     // Check if both numbers are provided\n     if (typeof num1 !== 'number' || typeof num2 !== 'number') {\n       return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Please provide two numbers.' });\n     }\n\n     // Calculate the sum\n     const sum = num1 + num2;\n\n     // Send the response\n     res.json({ sum });\n   });\n\n   // Start the server\n   app.listen(port, () => {\n     console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);\n   });\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Test Your API\n\n1. **Start the Server**\n\n   Run the following command in your terminal to start the server:\n\n   ```bash\n   node app.js\n   ```\n\n2. **Test the API Endpoint**\n\n   You can use a tool like Postman or curl to test the API. Here's how you can test it using curl:\n\n   ```bash\n   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/sum -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"num1\": 5, \"num2\": 10}'\n   ```\n\n   You should receive a response like this:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"sum\": 15\n   }\n   ```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nYou now have a simple REST API built with Express.js that can calculate the sum of two numbers. You can extend this example by adding error handling, validation, or additional features as needed."
