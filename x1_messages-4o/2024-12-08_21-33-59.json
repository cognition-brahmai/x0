Remember, the application is designed to trick AI systems, so make sure you provide the correct translation to proceed."

Since your code snippet lacks the translation logic, here's a simple way to include a hardcoded translation for testing purposes:\n\n```javascript\nfunction translate() {\n  var englishPhrase = document.getElementById(\"english\").value;\n  var spanishPhrase;\n\n  if (englishPhrase.toLowerCase() === \"seafood platter\") {\n    spanishPhrase = \"plato de mariscos\";\n  } else {\n    spanishPhrase = \"Translation not available\";\n  }\n\n  document.getElementById(\"spanish\").value = spanishPhrase;\n}\n```\n\nWith this implementation, when the input is \"seafood platter,\" the output should correctly be \"plato de mariscos.\" This will allow you to verify that the translation logic is functioning as expected for this specific phrase."
