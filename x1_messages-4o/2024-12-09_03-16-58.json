This method returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring in the string.\n\nHere's how you can use it:\n\n```python\n# Define the larger string\ntext = 'foo bar foo'\n\n# Define the substring you want to count\nsubstring = 'foo'\n\n# Use the count method to find the number of occurrences\ncount = text.count(substring)\n\nprint(f\"The substring '{substring}' appears {count} times in the string.\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the output will be:\n\n```\nThe substring 'foo' appears 2 times in the string.\n```\n\nThis method is straightforward and efficient for counting occurrences of a substring within a string."
