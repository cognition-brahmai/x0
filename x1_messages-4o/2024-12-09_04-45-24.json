However, after registering to download cuDNN, I see multiple options. For Ubuntu 16.04, it's either the Linux or Ubuntu Runtime or Developer version. Which one should I install? Is there any difference between them?"

        "content": "When installing cuDNN for TensorFlow, you need to choose the appropriate version that matches your system and needs. Let's clarify the options you have:\n\n1. **cuDNN Runtime Library**: This is the set of libraries that are required to run applications using cuDNN. If you're only planning to run pre-built TensorFlow binaries and not developing any custom CUDA code, this might be sufficient.\n\n2. **cuDNN Developer Library**: This includes everything in the runtime library plus header files and static libraries that are needed if you plan to compile and build your own applications or custom TensorFlow operations that utilize cuDNN.\n\nFor a typical TensorFlow installation where you intend to simply use TensorFlow without modifying its underlying CUDA operations, you can install the **cuDNN Runtime Library**. However, if you plan to do development that involves building custom operations or modifying TensorFlow, then you'll need the **cuDNN Developer Library**.\n\nIn summary, if you are just setting up TensorFlow to use it as is, go with the Runtime Library. If you foresee needing to develop or compile CUDA code that uses cuDNN, opt for the Developer Library."
