        "content": "Certainly! Here is a revised requirement for the summary:\n\nThe summary must include a detailed description of the boy's emotional state throughout his journey to finding the mysterious door. This entails capturing the nuances of his feelings, such as his initial curiosity and excitement upon discovering hints of the door's existence, any fear or apprehension he experiences during the more daunting parts of his journey, moments of doubt or frustration when faced with setbacks, and the sense of wonder or fulfillment upon reaching his goal. Additionally, the summary should highlight any significant obstacles he encountered along the way, whether they are physical challenges, such as difficult terrain or hidden traps, or emotional and psychological hurdles, such as self-doubt or external discouragement. This comprehensive portrayal will provide a vivid narrative of the boy's adventure and growth."
