Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Create the Text widget** normally.\n2. **Insert the desired text** into the widget.\n3. **Set the state to \"disabled\"** to make it read-only.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```python\nimport tkinter as tk\n\n# Create the main window\nroot = tk.Tk()\nroot.title(\"Read-Only Text Widget Example\")\n\n# Create a Text widget\ntext_widget = tk.Text(root, height=10, width=40)\n\n# Insert some text into the widget\ntext_widget.insert(tk.END, \"This is a read-only text widget.\\nYou cannot edit this text.\")\n\n# Disable the widget to make it read-only\ntext_widget.config(state=tk.DISABLED)\n\n# Pack the widget into the window\ntext_widget.pack()\n\n# Run the main event loop\nroot.mainloop()\n```\n\nIn this example, the text widget is first populated with some text, and then its state is set to `tk.DISABLED` to make it read-only. If you need to modify the text programmatically later on, you can temporarily set the state back to `tk.NORMAL`, make your changes, and then set it back to `tk.DISABLED`. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Enable the widget to modify the text programmatically\ntext_widget.config(state=tk.NORMAL)\n\n# Insert additional text\ntext_widget.insert(tk.END, \"\\nAdding more text programmatically.\")\n\n# Disable the widget again\ntext_widget.config(state=tk.DISABLED)\n```\n\nThis way, you can control when and how the text can be modified, ensuring that users cannot alter it directly."
