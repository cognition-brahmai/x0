        "content": "What is the difference between keras.metrics.Accuracy() and \"accuracy\" in TensorFlow/Keras? I have been trying different ways to build neural network models and noticed something unusual with the metric during model compilation. I used two methods: one using keras.metrics.Accuracy() and the other using \"accuracy\". The results were vastly different. In the first approach, I got very low accuracy results, while the second approach provided much higher accuracy. I initially thought \"accuracy\" and keras.metrics.Accuracy() would yield the same results, especially since \"adam\" and keras.optimizers.Adam() seem to be equivalent. Could anyone clarify why there is such a difference? Also, when I put the metric in square brackets, I get strange results as well. Can anyone explain this behavior?"

        "content": "The difference you observed between `keras.metrics.Accuracy()` and the string `\"accuracy\"` in TensorFlow/Keras stems from how these metrics are computed and applied during model training and evaluation.\n\n### `keras.metrics.Accuracy()`\n- **Use Case**: This is a standalone metric object that you can use to manually update and calculate accuracy. It's often used when you want to compute accuracy outside of model training, such as in custom training loops.\n- **Functionality**: It computes the accuracy by comparing predicted labels to true labels, but it expects both inputs to be in a specific format. When used incorrectly (e.g., with raw logits or probabilities), it can lead to unexpected results. It requires you to manually update state using `update_state()` and then retrieve the result with `result()`.\n\n### `\"accuracy\"`\n- **Use Case**: This is a shorthand string used during model compilation to specify that you want to use the built-in accuracy calculation provided by Keras.\n- **Functionality**: When you specify `\"accuracy\"` as a metric in `model.compile()`, Keras automatically applies the appropriate accuracy computation based on the model's output and the loss function. For example, it will handle converting logits to class predictions, if necessary. This often results in what users expect as \"accuracy\" in classification problems.\n\n### Why the Difference?\n1. **Input Format**: `keras.metrics.Accuracy()` requires specific input formats and may not handle raw model outputs directly. In contrast, `\"accuracy\"` integrates directly with the model\u2019s outputs and labels, handling the necessary conversions internally.\n   \n2. **Integration**: The string `\"accuracy\"` integrates seamlessly into the Keras training loop, ensuring that inputs and outputs are matched correctly according to the problem type (binary, categorical, etc.).\n\n3. **Manual Update**: Using `keras.metrics.Accuracy()` requires manual updates and may not align with the automatic updates done during the training loop, leading to discrepancies.\n\n### Square Brackets in Compilation\nWhen you put metrics in square brackets like `metrics=['accuracy']`, you're specifying a list of metrics for Keras to track during training. This is the correct way to pass multiple metrics, even if there\u2019s only one. The unusual results might arise from incorrect usage or misunderstanding of how lists are processed, but generally, using square brackets is standard practice for specifying metrics.\n\n### Recommendations\n- For typical use cases, use `\"accuracy\"` as a metric string in `model.compile()` for straightforward accuracy tracking.\n- Use `keras.metrics.Accuracy()` only if you need manual control over the metric computation, such as in custom training or evaluation loops.\n\nIf you consistently observe strange results, ensure that your data preprocessing, model outputs, and label formats align with the expected inputs for the metrics you are using."
