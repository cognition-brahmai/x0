I have a command line program that takes some time to complete and I want to know the exact time it takes to finish. I've looked at the `timeit` module, but it seems to be suitable only for timing small snippets of code. How can I measure the time taken by the entire program?"

        "content": "To measure the execution time of an entire Python program, you can use the `time` module, which is simple and effective for this purpose. You can record the start time at the beginning of your program and the end time right before it finishes, then calculate the difference. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef main():\n    # Your program logic here\n    pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    start_time = time.time()  # Record the start time\n    main()                    # Run your program\n    end_time = time.time()    # Record the end time\n\n    execution_time = end_time - start_time  # Calculate the execution time\n    print(f\"Execution time: {execution_time:.2f} seconds\")\n```\n\nThis will print the total time your program took to execute in seconds. The `:.2f` formatting is used to display the time with two decimal places, but you can adjust it as needed for more or less precision.\n\nAlternatively, if you are using Python 3.3 or later, you can use `time.perf_counter()` for a more precise measurement, as it offers better resolution for timing:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef main():\n    # Your program logic here\n    pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    start_time = time.perf_counter()  # Use perf_counter for higher precision\n    main()                            # Run your program\n    end_time = time.perf_counter()    # Record the end time\n\n    execution_time = end_time - start_time  # Calculate the execution time\n    print(f\"Execution time: {execution_time:.2f} seconds\")\n```\n\nBoth methods will give you a reliable measurement of how long your Python program takes to execute. Choose `time.perf_counter()` if you need higher precision, especially for programs that run very quickly."
