Instead of getting the accurate row count (which should be 400), I am getting `row_count = 0`. Where could I be going wrong?\n\nHere is the code I am currently using:\n\n```python\nf = open(adresse,\"r\")\nreader = csv.reader(f,delimiter = \",\")\ndata = [l for l in reader]\nrow_count = sum(1 for row in reader)\n\nprint(row_count)\n```"

        "content": "The issue with your code is that you are trying to iterate over the CSV reader twice. When you first create the list `data`, you consume the entire CSV reader. Then, when you try to calculate the `row_count` using `sum(1 for row in reader)`, the reader is already exhausted, and thus, you get a count of zero.\n\nTo fix this issue, you should only iterate over the CSV reader once. You can count the number of lines directly without storing them in a list first. Here's a corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\nadresse = 'your_file.csv'  # Make sure to set the correct path to your CSV file\nwith open(adresse, \"r\") as f:\n    reader = csv.reader(f, delimiter=\",\")\n    row_count = sum(1 for row in reader)\n\nprint(row_count)\n```\n\nKey points:\n- Ensure you are using the correct file path for `adresse`.\n- Use the `with` statement for file handling as it ensures proper resource management, automatically closing the file after the block is executed.\n- Directly count the rows using `sum(1 for row in reader)` without creating an additional list. \n\nThis should give you the correct row count of your CSV file."
