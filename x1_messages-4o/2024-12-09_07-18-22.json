        "content": "Is it possible to chain together multiple managers in Django to produce a query set that is affected by both of the individual managers? I am working on an example where I have multiple abstract model classes that provide specific functionality to other models. Two of these models are a DeleteMixin and a GlobalMixin. The DeleteMixin provides a pseudo-delete (the deleted flag) instead of actually deleting the object. The GlobalMixin allows any object to be defined as either a global object or a private object (like a public/private blog post). Both of these have their own managers that affect the queryset that is returned. My DeleteManager filters the queryset to only return results that have the deleted flag set to False, while the GlobalManager filters the queryset to only return results that are marked as global. I want to have a model extend both of these abstract models and grant the ability to only return the results that are both non-deleted and global."

        "content": "To achieve the desired functionality of chaining together multiple managers in Django, you need to create a custom manager that combines the logic of both `DeleteManager` and `GlobalManager`. You can do this by creating a new manager that inherits from both of these managers and then implements the logic to apply both filters. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can accomplish this:\n\n1. **Create Abstract Models**: Ensure you have the abstract models `DeleteMixin` and `GlobalMixin` with their respective fields and managers.\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass DeleteMixin(models.Model):\n    deleted = models.BooleanField(default=False)\n\n    class Meta:\n        abstract = True\n\nclass GlobalMixin(models.Model):\n    is_global = models.BooleanField(default=False)\n\n    class Meta:\n        abstract = True\n```\n\n2. **Define Individual Managers**: Define the managers for `DeleteMixin` and `GlobalMixin`.\n\n```python\nclass DeleteManager(models.Manager):\n    def get_queryset(self):\n        return super().get_queryset().filter(deleted=False)\n\nclass GlobalManager(models.Manager):\n    def get_queryset(self):\n        return super().get_queryset().filter(is_global=True)\n```\n\n3. **Create a Combined Manager**: Create a manager that combines both filters.\n\n```python\nclass CombinedManager(DeleteManager, GlobalManager):\n    def get_queryset(self):\n        return super(DeleteManager, self).get_queryset().filter(deleted=False, is_global=True)\n```\n\n4. **Define Your Model**: Use the `CombinedManager` for your model that extends both abstract models.\n\n```python\nclass MyModel(DeleteMixin, GlobalMixin):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n\n    objects = CombinedManager()\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return self.name\n```\n\n5. **Usage**: When you query `MyModel.objects.all()`, it will return objects that are both non-deleted and global.\n\nThis approach leverages Django's powerful manager system to apply multiple filters to a queryset. By combining the logic into a single manager, you ensure that both conditions are applied whenever you query the model."
