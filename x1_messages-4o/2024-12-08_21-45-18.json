        "content": "To classify Coal, Solar energy, and Wind energy based on their renewability status using SQL queries, you can write a simple SQL query that selects and categorizes these resources based on their \"Type\" column. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Name, \n       Type, \n       CASE \n           WHEN Type = 'Renewable' THEN 'Renewable Resource'\n           WHEN Type = 'Nonrenewable' THEN 'Nonrenewable Resource'\n           ELSE 'Unknown Type'\n       END AS Classification\nFROM NaturalResources;\n```\n\nIn this query, we use a `CASE` statement to classify the resources based on their \"Type\". If the \"Type\" is 'Renewable', it classifies the resource as 'Renewable Resource', and if the \"Type\" is 'Nonrenewable', it classifies it as 'Nonrenewable Resource'. The `ELSE` part is a fallback for any unexpected values in the \"Type\" column, labeling them as 'Unknown Type'."
