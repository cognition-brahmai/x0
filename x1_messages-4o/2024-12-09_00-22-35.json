        "content": "How can I print an error message without printing a traceback, and close the program when a certain condition is not met in my Python code? I have a class with an execute method and I want it to raise a custom error message and terminate the entire program when a particular condition is not met - specifically, when `self._then` is not equal to the string \"THEN\" (in all caps). Here is my current class structure:\n\n```python\nclass Stop_if_no_then():\n    def __init__(self, value one, operator, value_two, then, line_or_label, line_number):\n        self._firstvalue = value_one\n        self._secondvalue = value_two\n        self._operator = operator\n        self._gohere = line_or_label\n        self._then = then\n        self._line_number = line_number\n\n    def execute(self, OtherClass):\n        \"code comparing the first two values and making changes etc\"\n```\n\nIf the error is encountered, I want it to print out a message like this: `Syntax Error (Line 3): No -THEN- present in the statement.`. I've tried using sys.exit() but it prints out a large block of red text. I don't want to catch the exception in my loop as I need to implement something similar in other classes in the same module."

        "content": "To achieve the behavior you want, you can use the `sys.exit()` function in combination with a custom error message. However, to avoid displaying a traceback, you'll need to ensure that any exceptions raised by `sys.exit()` are not handled or allowed to propagate in a way that results in a traceback being printed. One approach is to simply check the condition and print the error message directly before exiting. Here's how you can modify your class to accomplish this:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nclass Stop_if_no_then():\n    def __init__(self, value_one, operator, value_two, then, line_or_label, line_number):\n        self._firstvalue = value_one\n        self._secondvalue = value_two\n        self._operator = operator\n        self._gohere = line_or_label\n        self._then = then\n        self._line_number = line_number\n\n    def execute(self, OtherClass):\n        # Check if self._then is not equal to \"THEN\"\n        if self._then != \"THEN\":\n            # Print the custom error message without traceback\n            print(f\"Syntax Error (Line {self._line_number}): No -THEN- present in the statement.\")\n            # Exit the program with an error status\n            sys.exit(1)\n\n        # Rest of your code logic here\n        # \"code comparing the first two values and making changes etc\"\n\n# Example usage:\n# stop_instance = Stop_if_no_then(value_one, operator, value_two, then, line_or_label, line_number)\n# stop_instance.execute(SomeOtherClassInstance)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Condition Check**: The `if self._then != \"THEN\":` line checks if `self._then` is not equal to the string \"THEN\".\n- **Error Message**: The `print()` function is used to output a custom error message to the console.\n- **Exit Program**: The `sys.exit(1)` statement is used to terminate the program. `1` indicates that the program is exiting with an error condition.\n\nBy directly using `sys.exit()` without raising an exception, you avoid printing a traceback. This approach ensures that the program exits cleanly with a custom message when the specified condition is not met."
