        "content": "In Python, on Unix-based systems as well as other platforms, the `time.sleep()` function is designed to block the thread that calls it, not the entire process. This means that if you have multiple threads running within a single process, calling `time.sleep()` in one thread will pause only that specific thread, allowing other threads within the same process to continue executing. This behavior is particularly useful in multi-threaded applications where you want to pause execution temporarily in one part of your program without affecting other parts."
