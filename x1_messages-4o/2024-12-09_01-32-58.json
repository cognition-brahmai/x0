When I launch the kernel with 1024 threads per Block, I get an error stating \"too many resources requested for launch\". I've attempted running the program multiple times with different block and thread counts, but the error persists with 1024 Threads per Block. Upon checking the used registers, they seem to be okay. The function with 28 registers is the kernel that uses so many threads. All other kernels use only <<<1, 32>>> per call. This program works with my GTX 660 with Compute Capability 3.0 and 1024 Threads per Block. Can anyone help me identify the issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is related to the limitations of the Compute Capability 2.0 on your GTX 480. Different GPU architectures have different limitations regarding the number of registers, threads per block, and other resources.\n\nHere are some potential reasons and solutions:\n\n1. **Compute Capability Limitations**: The GTX 480 has a Compute Capability of 2.0, which has stricter limitations compared to newer architectures like your GTX 660 with Compute Capability 3.0. Specifically, Compute Capability 2.0 GPUs can support a maximum of 1536 threads per multiprocessor, whereas newer GPUs can often handle more.\n\n2. **Registers and Resource Usage**: Even though you mentioned that the registers seem okay, the high number of registers used per thread (28 in your case) can cause resource exhaustion when trying to launch many threads. This is because the total number of registers is divided among all threads in a block, and high register usage per thread can limit the number of threads that can be launched.\n\n3. **Reducing Threads per Block**: Try reducing the number of threads per block. For example, use 512 or 256 threads per block instead of 1024. This will reduce the resource demand for your kernel launch.\n\n4. **Optimize Register Usage**: Consider optimizing your kernel code to reduce the number of registers used per thread. This can often be achieved by reusing variables, using shared memory more effectively, or by manually guiding the compiler with `__launch_bounds__`.\n\n5. **Check Other Resource Limits**: Ensure that you are not exceeding other limits like shared memory usage or the maximum number of threads per block. You can query these limits programmatically using the CUDA API.\n\n6. **CUDA Occupancy Calculator**: Use the NVIDIA CUDA Occupancy Calculator to determine the optimal number of threads and blocks for your kernel based on the register and shared memory usage.\n\nAdjusting these factors can help you fit within the resource constraints of the GTX 480 and should help resolve the \"too many resources requested for launch\" error."
