This leads to my server connections being kept open as they wait for the external API to respond, subsequently occupying worker time and resources. I am aware that I can employ gunicorn's thread or gevent workers to add concurrency, but I am struggling to understand the precise difference between using gunicorn with gevent workers and uvicorn (or any other server) with the ASGI interface. What would be the criteria for using one over the other? Additionally, considering Django still doesn't fully support async/await views, would it be more beneficial if I just stick with gevent workers?"

        "content": "When dealing with a slow external API in a Django application, it's important to select the right approach to handle concurrency and optimize resource usage. Let's explore the differences between using Gunicorn with Gevent workers and using Uvicorn with the ASGI interface, and consider which might be more appropriate for your situation.\n\n### Gunicorn with Gevent Workers\n\n- **Concurrency Model**: Gevent provides a way to handle concurrency by using greenlets, which are lightweight pseudo-threads. They allow you to perform non-blocking I/O operations, which is useful when waiting for external API responses.\n- **Compatibility**: Gevent can be used with Django, but it doesn't require Django to support async/await natively, as it operates at a lower level by monkey-patching Python's standard library.\n- **Ease of Use**: Gevent is relatively easy to integrate with existing WSGI-based Django applications without requiring major code changes.\n- **Drawbacks**: Gevent's monkey-patching can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior, and it's not as efficient as modern async frameworks designed specifically for async/await patterns.\n\n### Uvicorn with ASGI\n\n- **Concurrency Model**: Uvicorn is designed for ASGI applications and supports asynchronous I/O. It leverages Python's native async/await syntax, providing a more modern and efficient approach to handling concurrency.\n- **Compatibility**: As of now, Django's async capabilities are limited, so using Uvicorn with Django might not fully utilize Uvicorn's async potential. However, if you use Django Channels or other async-compatible components, Uvicorn can be advantageous.\n- **Future-Proof**: If your project plans include leveraging Django's future async capabilities or integrating with other async frameworks, starting with Uvicorn could be beneficial.\n- **Drawbacks**: Running a fully async stack with Django can require more substantial changes to your codebase and architecture.\n\n### Considerations for Your Scenario\n\n1. **Current Django Limitations**: Since Django's async support is still evolving, sticking with Gevent might be more straightforward if you want to avoid significant refactoring and still benefit from concurrent request handling.\n\n2. **Project Roadmap**: If you anticipate adopting more async features or transitioning to a more async-friendly framework in the future, investing time in adapting your application to use Uvicorn and the ASGI interface could be worthwhile.\n\n3. **Performance Needs**: Evaluate the performance gains you need. Gevent can give you considerable improvements with relatively minor changes, while a full async setup might offer better scalability and efficiency in the long run.\n\n4. **Complexity vs. Benefit**: If the complexity of transitioning to ASGI doesn't justify the benefits for your specific use case, sticking with Gevent is a practical and effective solution.\n\nIn summary, if your primary goal is to handle the slow external API with minimal changes and take advantage of concurrency without diving deep into async patterns, Gevent with Gunicorn is a suitable choice. If you're looking toward future-proofing your application and leveraging modern async capabilities, consider the ASGI route with Uvicorn."
