Specifically, is altering the `random_state` to 10 different numbers the correct method? I ask because I did not find any `random_state` parameter in `Stratified K-Fold` or `K-Fold`, and the separations from `K-Fold` are always identical for the same data. Additionally, I have concerns about the note that \"contrary to other cross-validation strategies, random splits do not guarantee that all folds will be different, although this is still very likely for sizeable datasets\". Is this always the case for 10*10 fold CV?"

        "content": "In scikit-learn, implementing a 10x10 cross-validation scheme using `ShuffleSplit` is a valid approach, but it's important to understand how it differs from using `KFold` or `StratifiedKFold`. \n\n### Understanding 10x10 Cross-Validation\n\nThe term \"10x10 cross-validation\" typically refers to running 10-fold cross-validation 10 times, each time with a different random partitioning of the data. This is often done to get a more robust estimate of model performance by reducing the variance associated with a single partitioning.\n\n### `ShuffleSplit` vs. `KFold`/`StratifiedKFold`\n\n1. **ShuffleSplit**:\n   - **How It Works**: `ShuffleSplit` generates a user-defined number of independent train-test splits. It randomly shuffles the data before each split.\n   - **Random State**: You can set or change the `random_state` parameter to ensure different random shuffles. This is useful for implementing the 10 repetitions of 10-fold CV.\n   - **Guarantees**: Unlike `KFold` or `StratifiedKFold`, `ShuffleSplit` doesn't guarantee that the splits will be disjoint or that all samples will be used exactly once per fold. However, for large datasets, the likelihood of overlap is minimal.\n\n2. **KFold** and **StratifiedKFold**:\n   - These methods partition the data into `k` folds deterministically, meaning the same splits will be generated every time for the same data and `k`.\n   - These methods don't have a `random_state` parameter because they are not random by nature.\n   - `StratifiedKFold` maintains the distribution of class labels across folds, which is important for imbalanced datasets.\n\n### Implementing 10x10 CV with `ShuffleSplit`\n\nUsing `ShuffleSplit` for 10x10 CV involves setting `n_splits=10` and running the cross-validation process 10 times, each time with a different `random_state` value. This ensures that you get 10 different random partitions of the data for each fold.\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import ShuffleSplit\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\n\n# Example dataset\nX, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)\n\n# 10x10 CV\nscores = []\nfor i in range(10):\n    cv = ShuffleSplit(n_splits=10, test_size=0.1, random_state=i)\n    score = cross_val_score(SVC(), X, y, cv=cv)\n    scores.append(score)\n\n# Flatten and analyze scores\nall_scores = [s for score_set in scores for s in score_set]\naverage_score = sum(all_scores) / len(all_scores)\nprint(f\"Average score over 10x10 CV: {average_score}\")\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUsing `ShuffleSplit` with different `random_state` values is a suitable method for implementing 10x10 cross-validation. It provides the flexibility to get different splits for each repetition, ensuring a thorough evaluation of model performance. Just be mindful of the potential overlap in samples across folds, which is generally not a concern for large datasets."
