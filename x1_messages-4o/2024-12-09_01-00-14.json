I have a working environment and I can run my application with `docker-compose up`, but the PDB is not functioning. I've tried running `docker-compose run my-awesome-app python app.py 0.0.0.0:8000` but this does not allow me to access my application over `http://127.0.0.1:8000` from the host (which I can with `docker-compose up`). It also seems that each time I use `run`, new containers are created which I don't want. I'm using pdb++ for this example and a basic docker-compose.yml from this django example. I've experimented but nothing seems to help. I'm using docker-compose 1.3.0rc3 as it has Dockerfile pointing support."

        "content": "To use the Python debugger (PDB) effectively with Docker Compose, you need to ensure that your setup allows you to attach to the running container where your application is executing. Here's how you can set up your environment for debugging with PDB:\n\n1. **Enable Service Port Binding**:\n   Make sure your `docker-compose.yml` file has the necessary port bindings so that you can access your application from the host. For example:\n\n   ```yaml\n   services:\n     my-awesome-app:\n       build: .\n       ports:\n         - \"8000:8000\"\n       ...\n   ```\n\n2. **Run in Interactive Mode**:\n   Use the `docker-compose run` command with the `--service-ports` flag, which will use the ports specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file. This allows you to run the application in the foreground and attach a debugger.\n\n   ```bash\n   docker-compose run --service-ports my-awesome-app python app.py 0.0.0.0:8000\n   ```\n\n3. **Use `pdb.set_trace()`**:\n   Insert `pdb.set_trace()` (or `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` if pdb is not already imported) at the location in your code where you want to start debugging. This will pause execution and open an interactive PDB debugging session.\n\n4. **Container Reuse**:\n   To avoid creating a new container each time you run, you can use `docker-compose up` in combination with attaching to the running container. First, start the container:\n\n   ```bash\n   docker-compose up -d\n   ```\n\n   Then, attach to the running container:\n\n   ```bash\n   docker attach <container_id>\n   ```\n\n   Alternatively, you can use `docker exec` to run a shell or another process inside the running container:\n\n   ```bash\n   docker exec -it <container_id> bash\n   ```\n\n   From there, you can manually start your application with the debugger.\n\n5. **Using pdb++**:\n   If you're using `pdb++`, ensure it is installed and available in your Docker container. You can add it to your `requirements.txt` or install it in your Dockerfile.\n\n6. **Avoid Terminal Capturing**:\n   If using `docker-compose up` and `attach` doesn't work as expected, ensure that your terminal isn't capturing output that should go to the container. Check your terminal settings or try using a different terminal emulator.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to debug your Python application running in a Docker container using PDB or PDB++."
