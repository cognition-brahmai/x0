I found a method in Java that involves converting the Unicode string to its long normalized form (with separate characters for letters and diacritics) and then removing all \"diacritic\" characters. Is there a way to achieve this using just the Python standard library, without installing additional libraries like pyICU? Also, does the solution work for Python 3? I would prefer not to use explicit mapping from accented characters to their non-accented counterparts."

        "content": "Yes, you can remove accents or diacritics from a Unicode string in Python using the standard library without needing any additional libraries. You can achieve this by using the `unicodedata` module, which is part of the Python standard library. The approach involves normalizing the string to its decomposed form and then filtering out the combining characters (diacritics). Here's how you can do it in Python 3:\n\n```python\nimport unicodedata\n\ndef remove_accents(input_str):\n    # Normalize the string to NFD (Normalization Form Decomposed)\n    # This separates characters from their combining diacritical marks\n    nfkd_form = unicodedata.normalize('NFD', input_str)\n    \n    # Filter out combining characters (character category is 'Mn')\n    without_accents = ''.join(\n        char for char in nfkd_form if unicodedata.category(char) != 'Mn'\n    )\n    \n    return without_accents\n\n# Example usage\ninput_string = \"Caf\u00e9 M\u00fcnchner Kindl\"\noutput_string = remove_accents(input_string)\nprint(output_string)  # Outputs: Cafe Munchner Kindl\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `unicodedata.normalize('NFD', input_str)`: This function normalizes the input string to its decomposed form (NFD), where characters and their diacritics are separated.\n- `unicodedata.category(char)`: This returns the Unicode category of a character. Combining marks have the category 'Mn'.\n- The list comprehension filters out all characters with a category of 'Mn', effectively removing the diacritics.\n\nThis method is efficient and works well for most use cases involving the removal of accents or diacritics in Python 3."
