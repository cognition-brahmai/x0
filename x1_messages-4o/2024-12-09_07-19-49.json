My list is as follows:\n```python\nwords = ['aba', 'xyz', 'xgx', 'dssd', 'sdjh']\n```\nI want to increment a counter every time the first and last element of a string are the same. I have tried manually iterating over the elements of the strings and it works. However, when I attempt to use a for loop to iterate over all elements of all strings, I encounter a TypeError: \"list indices must be integers, not str\". How can I successfully iterate over all the strings in the list and compare their first and last elements?"

Here's how you can do it using a for loop:\n\n```python\nwords = ['aba', 'xyz', 'xgx', 'dssd', 'sdjh']\n\n# Initialize a counter\ncounter = 0\n\n# Iterate over each string in the list\nfor word in words:\n    # Check if the first and last characters of the string are the same\n    if word[0] == word[-1]:\n        # Increment the counter\n        counter += 1\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"Number of strings where the first and last characters are the same:\", counter)\n```\n\nIn this code snippet:\n- We initialize a counter to zero.\n- We loop over each string in the `words` list.\n- For each string, we check if the first (`word[0]`) and the last (`word[-1]`) characters are the same.\n- If they are the same, we increment the counter.\n- Finally, we print the count of such strings.\n\nThis approach avoids the `TypeError` because we're iterating over the list of strings directly, rather than trying to use string indices on the list itself."
