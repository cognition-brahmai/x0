        "content": "In CUDA, pinned memory (also known as page-locked memory) can be used for efficient data transfers between the host and device. It achieves this by preventing the memory from being paged out, allowing for faster data transfer via DMA (Direct Memory Access). However, there is a distinction between regular pinned memory and \"zero-copy\" memory.\n\n1. **Pinned Memory**: When you allocate memory with `cudaHostAlloc()` and the default flag (`cudaHostAllocDefault`), it is pinned, meaning it won't be paged out by the operating system. This allows for more efficient transfers compared to pageable memory because the OS doesn't have to perform page-locking operations dynamically during transfers.\n\n2. **Zero-Copy Memory**: When you allocate with `cudaHostAllocMapped`, the memory is both pinned and mapped, allowing the device to access it directly without an explicit `cuMemcpyHtoD` or `cuMemcpyDtoH` transfer. This is what makes it \"zero-copy\" \u2014 the memory can be accessed by both the host and device without explicit copying. This is particularly useful for scenarios where frequent small data exchanges are needed, and you want to avoid the overhead of copying.\n\nIn your code, the behavior you are observing is due to the use of zero-copy memory. By passing the host pointer directly to the kernel, the GPU can access the memory allocated on the host because it is pinned and mapped. This eliminates the need to explicitly copy data back and forth for the kernel to read and write.\n\nThe reason CUDA provides an explicit way to map it using `cudaHostAllocMapped` is for finer control and optimization purposes. Not all applications benefit from zero-copy. In some cases, explicitly controlling when and how data is transferred can lead to better performance, especially when dealing with larger data sets or when overlapping computation with data transfer.\n\nIn summary:\n- Using `cudaHostAllocDefault` gives you pinned memory, which is efficient for explicit memory copies.\n- Using `cudaHostAllocMapped` allows for zero-copy access by mapping the memory to the device's address space, enabling direct access without explicit transfers."
