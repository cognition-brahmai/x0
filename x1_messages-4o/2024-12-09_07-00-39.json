Here's an example of my code:\n\n```\nc = raw_input('Press s or n to continue:')\nif c.upper() == 'S':\n    print 'YES'\n```\n\nThis code works as I intended, but the user has to press enter in the shell after pressing 's'. Is there a way to receive user input in Python without needing the user to press enter in the shell? Note: I am using Unix machines."

These modules allow you to set the terminal to raw mode, which lets you read a single character at a time. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport tty\nimport termios\n\ndef get_single_keypress():\n    fd = sys.stdin.fileno()\n    old_settings = termios.tcgetattr(fd)\n    try:\n        tty.setraw(sys.stdin.fileno())\n        ch = sys.stdin.read(1)\n    finally:\n        termios.tcsetattr(fd, termios.TCSADRAIN, old_settings)\n    return ch\n\nprint('Press s or n to continue:')\nc = get_single_keypress()\nif c.upper() == 'S':\n    print('YES')\nelse:\n    print('You pressed:', c)\n```\n\nThis code sets the terminal to raw mode, reads a single character, and then restores the terminal to its previous settings. Now, the user can press 's' or 'n' without needing to press enter."
