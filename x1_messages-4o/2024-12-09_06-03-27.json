Is `key` a special keyword, or simply a variable? For example, in the following code:\n\n```python\nd = {'x': 1, 'y': 2, 'z': 3}\nfor key in d:\n    print(key, 'corresponds to', d[key])\n```"

        "content": "In Python, when you iterate over a dictionary using a `for` loop, you are iterating over its keys by default. This behavior is not because `key` is a special keyword; it is simply a variable name that you have chosen. You could use any valid variable name, and the behavior would be the same.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n- When you use a `for` loop directly on a dictionary (e.g., `for key in d`), Python implicitly calls the dictionary's `__iter__` method, which returns an iterator over the keys of the dictionary.\n- Therefore, each iteration of the loop assigns a key from the dictionary to the variable you specify (`key` in your example).\n\nHere's a breakdown of your example:\n\n```python\nd = {'x': 1, 'y': 2, 'z': 3}\nfor key in d:  # 'key' is just a variable name; it could be 'k', 'item', or anything else\n    print(key, 'corresponds to', d[key])\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `d` is a dictionary with keys `'x'`, `'y'`, and `'z'`.\n- The `for` loop iterates over each key in the dictionary `d`.\n- During each iteration, the current key is assigned to the variable `key`.\n- You then use `d[key]` to access the value associated with that key and print it.\n\nIf you want to iterate over both keys and values, you can use the `items()` method:\n\n```python\nfor key, value in d.items():\n    print(key, 'corresponds to', value)\n```\n\nThis will give you direct access to both the key and the value in each iteration."
