        "content": "To pass a list as an argument from the command line in Python, you'll typically need to pass it as a string and then parse it within your script. Python's `argparse` module is commonly used for parsing command-line arguments, but it does not natively support list-type arguments directly from the command line. Instead, you can pass the list as a string and then parse it into a list within your script.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Pass the List as a String**: You can pass the list as a comma-separated string or any other delimiter you prefer.\n\n2. **Parse the String into a List**: Use Python's string methods to split the string into a list.\n\nBelow is an example of how you might implement this:\n\n### Step 1: Pass the Argument from the Command Line\n\nWhen you run your Python script, pass the list as a string. For example:\n\n```bash\npython my_script.py --details \"name,title,address\"\n```\n\n### Step 2: Parse the Argument in Your Script\n\nHere is a sample Python script using `argparse` to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport argparse\n\ndef main():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=\"Process some details.\")\n    parser.add_argument('--details', type=str, help='Comma-separated list of details')\n\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    # Split the string into a list\n    if args.details:\n        details_list = args.details.split(',')\n    else:\n        details_list = []\n\n    # Now you can use details_list in your script\n    print(\"Details List:\", details_list)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **argparse.ArgumentParser**: This is used to parse command-line options, arguments, and sub-commands.\n- **add_argument('--details', type=str)**: This specifies that `--details` is a string argument.\n- **args.details.split(',')**: This splits the comma-separated string into a list.\n\nBy using this approach, you can effectively handle list-like arguments passed from the command line in your Python scripts. You can modify the delimiter in `split()` if you choose to use a different character to separate your list items."
