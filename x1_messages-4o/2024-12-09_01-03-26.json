        "content": "When you retrieve a field object using `MyModel._meta.get_field(field_name)`, you're accessing the model's metadata to get the field definition itself, not the actual value of the field for a particular instance of the model. To get the value of that field for a specific instance, you'll need to do the following:\n\n1. **Retrieve the model instance**: First, you need to have a specific instance of your model. You can retrieve it using Django's ORM.\n\n2. **Access the field value**: Once you have the instance, you can access the value of the field using the field name as an attribute.\n\nHere's an example of how to do this:\n\n```python\n# Assume `MyModel` is your Django model and `field_name` is the name of the field.\n\n# First, get the instance of the model. For example:\ninstance = MyModel.objects.get(pk=1)  # Replace `1` with the appropriate primary key.\n\n# Now, access the field value using the field name.\nfield_value = getattr(instance, field_name)\n\nprint(field_value)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Retrieve the instance**: You need to obtain an instance of the model to work with. This can be done using `MyModel.objects.get(...)` or any other query that suits your needs.\n  \n- **Access the field value**: Use Python's built-in `getattr()` function to dynamically access the value of the field using its name. This is useful when you have the field name stored in a variable.\n\nThis approach allows you to dynamically access any field value of a model instance as long as you have the field name and an instance of the model."
