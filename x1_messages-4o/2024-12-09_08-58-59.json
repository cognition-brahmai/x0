        "content": "To retrieve records from a MongoDB collection based on their distance from a specific location, you can use a geospatial query. MongoDB supports geospatial queries using 2dsphere indexes, which allow you to perform queries based on spherical geometry. Here\u2019s how you can accomplish this:\n\n1. **Ensure your collection has geospatial data**: Your documents should contain a field with the location data. This field should be an array with two elements representing longitude and latitude, or it can be a GeoJSON object.\n\n2. **Create a 2dsphere index**: You need to create a 2dsphere index on the field that contains the location data.\n\n3. **Perform a geospatial query**: Use the `$near` operator to find documents near a specified point.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nSuppose you have a collection named `places` with documents that look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Central Park\",\n  \"location\": {\n    \"type\": \"Point\",\n    \"coordinates\": [-73.9654, 40.7829]  // [longitude, latitude]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 1: Create a 2dsphere index\n\nYou need to create a 2dsphere index on the `location` field:\n\n```javascript\ndb.places.createIndex({ location: \"2dsphere\" });\n```\n\n### Step 2: Perform the geospatial query\n\nTo find documents near a specific point, use the `$near` operator. For example, if you want to find places near the coordinates `[-73.9857, 40.7484]` (Times Square, NY), you would write:\n\n```javascript\ndb.places.find({\n  location: {\n    $near: {\n      $geometry: {\n        type: \"Point\",\n        coordinates: [-73.9857, 40.7484]\n      },\n      $maxDistance: 5000  // Distance in meters\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIn this query:\n\n- `$geometry` specifies the point from which to measure distance.\n- `$maxDistance` specifies the maximum distance from the point, in meters. You can adjust this value based on your needs.\n\nThis query will return all places within 5000 meters of Times Square.\n\nMake sure your MongoDB version supports geospatial queries and that your data is structured correctly for these operations."
