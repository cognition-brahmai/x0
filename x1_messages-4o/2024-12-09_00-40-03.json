Ideally, each item in the list should be written on a new line in the file, but instead, all items are being written on a single line. How can I modify my program to write each item on a new line? Here is the code I'm currently using:\n\n```python\nfr = open(sys.argv[1], 'r') # source file\nfw = open(sys.argv[2]+\"/masked_\"+sys.argv[1], 'w') # Target Directory Location\n\nfor line in fr:\n    line = line.strip()\n    if line == \"\":\n        continue\n    columns = line.strip().split('|')\n    if columns[0].find(\"@\") > 1:\n        looking_for = columns[0] # this is what we need to search\n    else:\n        looking_for = \"Dummy@dummy.com\"\n    if looking_for in d:\n        # by default, iterating over a dictionary will return keys\n            new_line = d[looking_for]+'|'+'|'.join(columns[1:])\n            line_list.append(new_line)\n    else:\n        new_idx = str(len(d)+1)\n        d[looking_for] = new_idx\n        kv = open(sys.argv[3], 'a')\n        kv.write(looking_for+\" \"+new_idx+'\\n')\n        kv.close()\n        new_line = d[looking_for]+'|'+'|'.join(columns[1:])\n        line_list.append(new_line)\nfw.writelines(line_list)\n```"

        "content": "To modify your Python program so that each item in the `line_list` is written on a new line in the file, you need to ensure that each line ends with a newline character (`\\n`). Currently, the `writelines()` method writes all items of the list to the file without adding newlines between them. \n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n1. When appending new lines to `line_list`, make sure each new line ends with a newline character.\n2. Use a context manager (`with` statement) for file operations to ensure files are properly closed.\n\nHere's the modified version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nline_list = []  # Initialize your line_list here\nd = {}  # Assuming d is a dictionary you're using\n\nwith open(sys.argv[1], 'r') as fr:  # source file\n    with open(sys.argv[2] + \"/masked_\" + sys.argv[1], 'w') as fw:  # Target Directory Location\n        for line in fr:\n            line = line.strip()\n            if line == \"\":\n                continue\n            columns = line.split('|')\n            if columns[0].find(\"@\") > 1:\n                looking_for = columns[0]  # this is what we need to search\n            else:\n                looking_for = \"Dummy@dummy.com\"\n            if looking_for in d:\n                new_line = d[looking_for] + '|' + '|'.join(columns[1:])\n                line_list.append(new_line + '\\n')  # Add newline character here\n            else:\n                new_idx = str(len(d) + 1)\n                d[looking_for] = new_idx\n                with open(sys.argv[3], 'a') as kv:\n                    kv.write(looking_for + \" \" + new_idx + '\\n')\n                new_line = d[looking_for] + '|' + '|'.join(columns[1:])\n                line_list.append(new_line + '\\n')  # Add newline character here\n\n        fw.writelines(line_list)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n- Added `\\n` to each line before appending it to the `line_list`.\n- Used the `with` statement for file operations to handle opening and closing files automatically.\n\nThese changes should ensure that each item in `line_list` is written to a new line in the file."
