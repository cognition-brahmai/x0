The error message you're encountering, \"Field list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent,\" typically indicates that there's an issue with the way the lines are structured or indented.\n\nHere's the correct way to document multiple exceptions with multi-line descriptions in Sphinx:\n\n```python\ndef some_funct():\n    \"\"\"\n    :raises ExceptionType1: Some multi-line\n        exception description that continues\n        on the next line.\n    :raises ExceptionType2: Another multi-line\n        exception description that continues\n        on the next line.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n\nKey points to remember:\n- Use `:raises ExceptionType:` followed by a colon for each exception.\n- Ensure that each exception description is indented by at least one more space than the exception line itself.\n- If the description spans multiple lines, the continuation lines should be indented further to align them properly with the start of the description.\n\nThis structure should help eliminate the error and properly document the exceptions."
