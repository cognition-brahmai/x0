I am encountering an issue with libNVVM not being found. I understand from a similar problem on a Linux system, that I might need to add an Environment Variable. I tried locating the 'nvvm' file and found it in 'C:\\Users\\ME\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python36\\Lib\\site-packages\\numba\\cuda\\tests\\cudadrv__pycache__'. However, adding this didn't resolve my problem. I have also tried 'conda install cudatoolkit' and updating it, but to no avail. Is the issue related to the OS not being able to locate this library? How do I point Python to the library it needs?"

        "content": "When dealing with the libNVVM not found issue while using CUDA with Python, it usually relates to the environment not being properly set up to locate the necessary CUDA libraries. Here's a step-by-step guide to resolve this:\n\n1. **Check CUDA Installation:**\n   Ensure that CUDA is properly installed on your system. You can do this by checking the CUDA installation directory, usually located at `C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v9.1`.\n\n2. **Set Environment Variables:**\n   You need to set environment variables to ensure that Python can locate the necessary CUDA libraries:\n\n   - **CUDA_HOME/CUDA_PATH:**\n     Add `CUDA_HOME` or `CUDA_PATH` pointing to your CUDA installation directory. For example:\n     ```\n     CUDA_PATH=C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v9.1\n     ```\n\n   - **Add to PATH:**\n     Ensure that the `bin` directory of CUDA is included in your system PATH. This can be done by adding the following to your PATH environment variable:\n     ```\n     C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v9.1\\bin\n     C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v9.1\\libnvvp\n     ```\n\n   - **Add NVVM Path:**\n     You might also need to set `NUMBAPRO_NVVM` and `NUMBAPRO_LIBDEVICE` environment variables:\n     ```\n     NUMBAPRO_NVVM=C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v9.1\\nvvm\\bin\\nvvm64_31_0.dll\n     NUMBAPRO_LIBDEVICE=C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\v9.1\\nvvm\\libdevice\n     ```\n\n3. **Verify Numba and CUDA Toolkit Compatibility:**\n   Make sure that the version of Numba you are using is compatible with CUDA 9.1. You can check Numba's documentation or GitHub repository for compatibility details.\n\n4. **Restart Your System:**\n   After making changes to environment variables, restart your system to ensure changes take effect.\n\n5. **Install/Update Numba and cudatoolkit via Conda:**\n   If you haven't already, ensure that you have installed and updated Numba and the CUDA toolkit via Conda:\n   ```bash\n   conda install numba cudatoolkit\n   ```\n   Make sure they are up-to-date to avoid any version mismatch issues.\n\n6. **Testing:**\n   Finally, test your setup by running a simple CUDA program using Numba to see if the issue persists.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the libNVVM not found issue and successfully use CUDA with Python."
