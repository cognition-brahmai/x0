I've seen formats like \"d\", \".2g\", \".1f\", \".1f%\" used in examples, but I'm not clear on the conventions being used. Are these formatting conventions common knowledge or is there a documentation page I missed?"

        "content": "The formatting conventions you are referring to are part of Python's string formatting mini-language. This is a versatile and powerful way to specify how values should be presented in strings. Here's a breakdown of the formats you've mentioned and how you can use them in Seaborn's heatmap:\n\n1. **\"d\"**: This is used for integers. It formats the number as a decimal integer.\n\n2. **\".2g\"**: This is used for floating-point numbers. It formats the number in either fixed-point format or exponential format, depending on its magnitude. The \"2\" specifies the number of significant digits.\n\n3. **\".1f\"**: This is used for floating-point numbers as well. It formats the number as a fixed-point number, with one digit after the decimal point.\n\n4. **\".1f%\"**: This is similar to \".1f\" but multiplies the number by 100 and appends a percent sign, which is useful for displaying percentages.\n\nTo format \"0.0045\" as \"0.45%\", you can use the \".2f%\" format. This will multiply the number by 100 and display it with two digits after the decimal point, followed by a percent sign.\n\nHere's how you can apply it to a Seaborn heatmap:\n\n```python\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Example data\ndata = np.array([[0.0045, 0.15, 0.25],\n                 [0.35, 0.45, 0.55],\n                 [0.65, 0.75, 0.85]])\n\n# Create a heatmap\nax = sns.heatmap(data, annot=True, fmt=\".2f%\")\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this code, `annot=True` tells Seaborn to annotate each cell with its value, and `fmt=\".2f%\"` specifies the format for these annotations. The `.2f%` format ensures that values like `0.0045` are displayed as `0.45%`.\n\nFor more details on the formatting options, you can refer to the official Python documentation on [Format Specification Mini-Language](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language). This documentation provides comprehensive information on how to use different format specifiers."
