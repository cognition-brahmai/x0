        "content": "The behavior you're observing is due to differences in how TensorFlow manages datasets in different versions. The `DatasetV1Adapter` is essentially a wrapper that allows datasets created with the V2 API to be used in contexts expecting a V1 dataset. This typically occurs when there's a mix of V1 and V2 API calls within your code or environment.\n\nTo ensure you're consistently using the V2 API and getting the expected `TensorSliceDataset` return type, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. **Check TensorFlow Version**: Ensure you are using a version of TensorFlow that supports the V2 API. TensorFlow 2.x uses the V2 API by default, but if you're using TensorFlow 1.x, you'll need to enable V2 behavior explicitly.\n\n2. **Enable Eager Execution (if using TensorFlow 1.x)**: If you're using TensorFlow 1.x, you can enable eager execution to use the V2 API features. This can be done by adding the following at the beginning of your script:\n\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n   tf.compat.v1.enable_v2_behavior()\n   ```\n\n3. **Ensure Consistent API Usage**: Make sure all your TensorFlow code is using the V2 API. This includes using functions from `tf.compat.v2` if you are in a TensorFlow 1.x environment.\n\n4. **Check for Mixed API Calls**: Ensure that your environment or script does not inadvertently mix V1 and V2 API calls, which can lead to the use of `DatasetV1Adapter`.\n\nIf you follow these steps and are still experiencing issues, it might be helpful to check any other parts of your code or environment that might be influencing the versioning, such as imports from other libraries that might be targeting V1 APIs. Additionally, make sure that your TensorFlow installation is up to date."
