Here's what I've tried so far:\n```python\npath.nodes = (\n    <GSNode x=535.0 y=0.0 GSLINE GSSHARP>,\n    <GSNode x=634.0 y=0.0 GSLINE GSSHARP>,\n    <GSNode x=377.0 y=706.0 GSLINE GSSHARP>,\n    <GSNode x=279.0 y=706.0 GSLINE GSSHARP>,\n    <GSNode x=10.0 y=0.0 GSLINE GSSHARP>,\n    <GSNode x=110.0 y=0.0 GSLINE GSSHARP>,\n    <GSNode x=189.0 y=216.0 GSLINE GSSHARP>,\n    <GSNode x=458.0 y=216.0 GSLINE GSSHARP>\n)\nprint(max(path.nodes, key=y))\n```\nHowever, I'm encountering this error: `NameError: name 'y' is not defined`\nI'm new to Python and the official Python docs aren't helping. When I iterate through the nodes like so:\n```python\nfor node in path.nodes:\n    print(node.y)\n```\nI do get the 'y' values correctly. Could someone explain what I'm doing wrong?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that Python's `max` function needs a callable (like a function or a lambda) as the `key` argument. In your code, `key=y` is incorrect because `y` isn't a defined function or variable; it's an attribute of each `GSNode` object.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to find the object with the maximum 'y' value using a lambda function:\n\n```python\nmax_node = max(path.nodes, key=lambda node: node.y)\nprint(max_node)\n```\n\nIn this modified code, `lambda node: node.y` is a short anonymous function that takes a node as input and returns its `y` attribute. This way, `max` knows to compare the nodes based on their `y` values."
