For example, in the string \"calvin klein design dress calvin klein\", I want to remove the second occurrence of \"calvin\" and \"klein\" while preserving the sequence of the words.

        "content": "To remove the second occurrence of duplicate words in a Python string while preserving the order of words, you can use a simple approach with a loop and a set to keep track of words that have already been seen. Here's a step-by-step guide along with a code example:\n\n1. Split the string into words.\n2. Iterate over the words while keeping track of words that have already been encountered.\n3. Construct a new list of words, adding each word only if it hasn't been added before.\n4. Join the words back into a string.\n\nHere's the code to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef remove_second_occurrence(input_string):\n    words = input_string.split()  # Split the string into words\n    seen = set()  # A set to track words that have been seen\n    result = []  # List to store words for the result\n    \n    for word in words:\n        if word not in seen:  # If the word hasn't been seen before\n            result.append(word)  # Add it to the result list\n            seen.add(word)  # Mark it as seen\n    \n    return ' '.join(result)  # Join the words back into a string\n\n# Example usage\ninput_string = \"calvin klein design dress calvin klein\"\nresult_string = remove_second_occurrence(input_string)\nprint(result_string)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `remove_second_occurrence` that processes the input string, ensuring each word is added to the result only once, effectively removing the second occurrence of any duplicates. The output for the example you provided will be:\n\n```\ncalvin klein design dress\n```\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the task using basic data structures like lists and sets."
