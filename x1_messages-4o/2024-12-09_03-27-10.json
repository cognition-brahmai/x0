Currently, I am using the REST APIs of the brokers to achieve this, but I am noticing a considerable delay when connecting to the server. I recently found out that there is also a WebSocket API available. Considering the importance of speed in my work, which type of API - REST or WebSocket - would be more suitable for my needs and would WebSocket be faster in this case?"

        "content": "In your scenario, where you need to access real-time financial data with updates every 0.5 seconds, using a WebSocket API would likely be more suitable and efficient than using REST APIs. Here's why:\n\n1. **Real-Time Communication**: WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single, long-lived connection. This means that once the connection is established, data can be sent and received simultaneously without the need to continuously open and close connections, as you would with REST APIs.\n\n2. **Reduced Latency**: Because WebSockets maintain a persistent connection, they generally have lower latency compared to REST APIs, which require a new HTTP connection for each request. This can significantly reduce the delay in receiving updates, which is crucial in environments where speed is critical, such as financial trading.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: WebSockets are more efficient in terms of network resources since they avoid the overhead associated with HTTP headers in each request/response cycle. This can lead to better performance, especially when handling frequent updates like those every 0.5 seconds.\n\n4. **Scalability**: With WebSockets, you can handle a large number of concurrent connections more efficiently, which is beneficial if your application needs to scale.\n\nGiven these advantages, switching to a WebSocket API should provide you with faster and more reliable access to the real-time data you need. However, it's important to ensure that your system can handle WebSockets and that you properly manage the connection lifecycle to maintain stability and performance."
