The list is formatted as follows: `string = [('limited', 1), ('all', 16), ('concept', 1), ('secondly', 1)]`. I am trying to convert this list into a dictionary where the first word of each pair is the key and the corresponding integer is the value. The code I have written so far is:\n\n```python\nmy_dict = {}\nfor pairs in string:\n    for int in pairs:\n       my_dict[pairs] = int\n```\n\nHowever, this does not seem to work as expected. How can I correctly convert this list of pairs into a dictionary?"

        "content": "The code you have written is close but needs some adjustments to correctly convert the list of pairs into a dictionary. You don't need a nested loop here. You can directly iterate over the list and map each string to its corresponding integer. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nstring = [('limited', 1), ('all', 16), ('concept', 1), ('secondly', 1)]\n\n# Initialize an empty dictionary\nmy_dict = {}\n\n# Iterate over each tuple in the list\nfor word, frequency in string:\n    # Assign the word as the key and the frequency as the value in the dictionary\n    my_dict[word] = frequency\n\n# Print the resulting dictionary to verify\nprint(my_dict)\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use a dictionary comprehension for a more concise solution:\n\n```python\nmy_dict = {word: frequency for word, frequency in string}\n\nprint(my_dict)\n```\n\nBoth methods will give you the desired dictionary:\n\n```python\n{'limited': 1, 'all': 16, 'concept': 1, 'secondly': 1}\n```"
