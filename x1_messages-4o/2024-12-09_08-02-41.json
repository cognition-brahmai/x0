I am attempting to use a global variable `str` in a function and convert a parameter into a string. The function works fine during the first call but throws a TypeError during the second call with the error message stating \"'str' object is not callable\". Here's an example code that shows this behavior:\n\n```python\ndef example(parameter):\n    global str\n    str = str(parameter)\n    print(str)\n\nexample(1)\nexample(2)\n```\nThe error message I receive is:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"test.py\", line 7, in <module>\n    example(2)\n  File \"test.py\", line 3, in example\n    str = str(parameter)\nTypeError: 'str' object is not callable\n```\nI would like to understand why this is happening and how it can be fixed. Also, if there is a way to resolve this issue in an interactive session without restarting the interpreter, it would be helpful."

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that you're assigning a new value to the global variable `str`, which shadows the built-in `str` type. In Python, `str` is the built-in type for strings, and by assigning `str = str(...)`, you're effectively replacing the built-in `str` type with a string object on the first call to `example()`. As a result, on the second call, when you try to use `str(...)` again, Python attempts to call a string object, which is not callable, leading to a `TypeError`.\n\nTo fix this issue, you should avoid using `str` as a variable name to prevent shadowing the built-in type. You can choose a different name for the variable. Here's how you can modify the code:\n\n```python\ndef example(parameter):\n    global my_str\n    my_str = str(parameter)\n    print(my_str)\n\nexample(1)\nexample(2)\n```\n\nIn this version, `my_str` is used as the variable name instead of `str`, which prevents any conflict with the built-in `str` type.\n\nIf you're in an interactive session and you want to resolve this issue without restarting the interpreter, you can delete the `str` variable, which will allow you to use the built-in `str` type again. You can do this using the `del` statement:\n\n```python\ndel str\n```\n\nAfter executing `del str`, the built-in `str` type will be restored, and you can continue using it without issues. However, it's still a good practice to avoid naming variables with names that conflict with built-in types or functions."
