        "content": "To check the Python version with which your Vim was compiled, you can use the following steps:\n\n1. **Check if Vim has Python support**: First, ensure that your Vim is compiled with Python support. You can check this by running the following command in Vim's command mode:\n\n   ```\n   :version\n   ```\n\n   Look for `+python` or `+python3` in the output. If you see `-python` or `-python3`, it means your Vim version does not have support for that version of Python.\n\n2. **Execute Python code within Vim**: If your Vim version supports Python or Python 3, you can use Vim's embedded Python interpreter to check the version. The syntax differs slightly based on whether you're using Python 2 or Python 3.\n\n   - For Python 2:\n\n     ```\n     :python import sys; print(sys.version)\n     ```\n\n   - For Python 3:\n\n     ```\n     :python3 import sys; print(sys.version)\n     ```\n\n   Make sure to use `:python` or `:python3` depending on the Python version your Vim supports.\n\n3. **Resolve SyntaxError**: If you encounter a `SyntaxError`, it could be due to incorrect syntax or using the wrong Python command (e.g., using `:python` when Vim only supports Python 3). Ensure you're executing the correct command based on the Python support available in your Vim.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to determine the Python version Vim was compiled with. If your Vim is not compiled with Python support, you may need to install a version of Vim that includes it, often available as a separate package in many package managers (`vim-nox` or `vim-gtk` for example)."
