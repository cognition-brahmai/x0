The code I have currently seems to work intermittently. However, I sporadically receive an error message \"[Errno 10048] Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted\" when I attempt to start the server after closing it within the last few minutes. I am programming in Python on Windows 7. How can I resolve this?\n\n```python\nfrom socket import *\n\nserverName = \"localhost\"\nserverPort = 4444\nBUFFER_SIZE = 1024\n\ns = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)\ns.bind((serverName, serverPort))\ns.listen(1)\n\nprint \"Server is ready to receive data...\"\n\nwhile 1:\n        newConnection, client = s.accept()\n        msg = newConnection.recv(BUFFER_SIZE)\n\n        print msg\n\n        newConnection.send(\"hello world\")\n        newConnection.close()\n```\n\nStack trace:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"path\\server.py\", line 8, in &lt;module&gt;\n    s.bind((serverName, serverPort))\n  File \"C:\\Python27\\lib\\socket.py\", line 224, in meth\n    return getattr(self._sock,name)(*args)\nerror: [Errno 10048] Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted\n```"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering, \"[Errno 10048] Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted\", is typically caused by trying to bind a socket to an address that is already in use. This is a common issue on Windows when a socket is not properly closed or when the operating system has not yet released the port after the socket has been closed.\n\nHere are a few steps and code adjustments you can use to address this issue:\n\n1. **Enable SO_REUSEADDR Option**: This allows a socket to forcibly bind to a port in use by a previous connection that is in the TIME_WAIT state. Add this option before binding the socket.\n\n2. **Ensure Proper Closure of the Socket**: Make sure to close the socket properly when the application is done.\n\n3. **Modify the Code**: Here's how you can adjust your code to handle the issue:\n\n```python\nfrom socket import *\n\nserverName = \"localhost\"\nserverPort = 4444\nBUFFER_SIZE = 1024\n\n# Create a TCP/IP socket\ns = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)\n\n# Enable SO_REUSEADDR to allow the socket to reuse the address\ns.setsockopt(SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, 1)\n\n# Bind the socket to the port\ns.bind((serverName, serverPort))\n\n# Listen for incoming connections\ns.listen(1)\n\nprint(\"Server is ready to receive data...\")\n\ntry:\n    while True:\n        # Wait for a connection\n        newConnection, client = s.accept()\n        try:\n            print(f\"Connected by {client}\")\n\n            # Receive the data from the client\n            msg = newConnection.recv(BUFFER_SIZE)\n            print(f\"Received: {msg.decode()}\")\n\n            # Send a response back to the client\n            newConnection.sendall(b\"hello world\")\n        finally:\n            # Clean up the connection\n            newConnection.close()\nfinally:\n    # Ensure the server socket is closed when the program exits\n    s.close()\n```\n\n4. **Check for TIME_WAIT State**: The TIME_WAIT state is a normal part of the TCP connection lifecycle. If you see sockets in this state using `netstat`, it's part of ensuring any delayed packets are handled correctly. The SO_REUSEADDR option should help mitigate this.\n\n5. **Use of Context Managers**: In Python, using context managers (`with` statement) can help ensure resources are properly cleaned up. However, in this case, explicitly closing the socket in a `finally` block is also effective.\n\n6. **Testing**: After making these changes, test the server again to ensure the error does not recur. Note that depending on system configuration and network conditions, there might still be small delays in releasing ports."
