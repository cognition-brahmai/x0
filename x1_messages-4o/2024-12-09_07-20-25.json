I've tried using this command: `py.test sanity_tests.py --cov=C:\\Test\\pytest --cov-report=xml`. However, this command seems to generate a coverage report and not a test report. Can anyone suggest a method to create a test report using pytest?"

        "content": "To generate a test report using `pytest`, you can use several different options depending on the format and detail level you require. Here are a few common methods to generate test reports with `pytest`:\n\n1. **Text Report Output to Console**:\n   By default, `pytest` outputs a text report to the console. You can simply run your tests with:\n   ```bash\n   pytest sanity_tests.py\n   ```\n   This will give you a summary of test results directly in the terminal.\n\n2. **JUnit XML Report**:\n   You can generate a JUnit-style XML report, which is useful for integration with CI/CD tools like Jenkins. Use the `--junitxml` option:\n   ```bash\n   pytest sanity_tests.py --junitxml=report.xml\n   ```\n\n3. **HTML Report**:\n   For a more detailed and visually appealing report, you can use the `pytest-html` plugin to generate an HTML report. First, install the plugin:\n   ```bash\n   pip install pytest-html\n   ```\n   Then, run your tests with:\n   ```bash\n   pytest sanity_tests.py --html=report.html\n   ```\n\n4. **Allure Reports**:\n   Allure is another popular choice for generating detailed and interactive reports. You need to install the `allure-pytest` plugin:\n   ```bash\n   pip install allure-pytest\n   ```\n   Run your tests with Allure:\n   ```bash\n   pytest sanity_tests.py --alluredir=allure-results\n   ```\n   Then, generate the report using Allure command-line tool:\n   ```bash\n   allure serve allure-results\n   ```\n   You need to have Allure command-line tool installed for this. Instructions can be found on the [Allure website](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/).\n\nChoose the method that best suits your needs and integrates well with your workflow."
