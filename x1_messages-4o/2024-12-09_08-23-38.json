The exact error message I get is \"Reverse for 'products.views.'filter_by_led' with arguments '()' and keyword arguments '{}' not found.\" I have confirmed that the import path for 'products.views.filter_by_led' is correct as I was able to successfully import it from the shell. The error seems to originate from the following line of code in my file: `href=\"{% url products.views.filter_by_led %}\"`. However, I am confused why this error is occurring as another similar line of code: `{% url products.views.lcd_screen_size screen_size=50 %}` works perfectly fine in the same file. The function 'filter_by_led' is defined as such: `def filter_by_led(request):`. I've tried deleting all the '*.pyc' files and restarting Apache to no avail. What could be the cause of this problem?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that Django is unable to find the URL pattern associated with the `filter_by_led` view. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check URL Configuration:**\n   Ensure that you have a URL pattern defined for the `filter_by_led` view in your `urls.py` file. It should look something like this:\n\n   ```python\n   from django.urls import path\n   from . import views\n\n   urlpatterns = [\n       path('filter-by-led/', views.filter_by_led, name='filter_by_led'),\n       # other url patterns\n   ]\n   ```\n\n2. **Use Named URL Patterns:**\n   It's recommended to use the URL pattern name instead of the view function path in the `{% url %}` template tag. Update your template to use the named URL pattern:\n\n   ```html\n   href=\"{% url 'filter_by_led' %}\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify URL Names:**\n   Make sure the name you use in the `{% url %}` tag matches the `name` argument in the `path()` function in your `urls.py`.\n\n4. **Check for Typos:**\n   Double-check for any typos in the URL name or the view function name in both your `urls.py` and template files.\n\n5. **Ensure URL Patterns Are Loaded:**\n   If you're using multiple `urls.py` files (e.g., one for each app), make sure they are included in your project's main `urls.py` file. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   from django.urls import include, path\n\n   urlpatterns = [\n       path('products/', include('products.urls')),\n       # other url patterns\n   ]\n   ```\n\n6. **Clear Cache and Restart Server:**\n   Clear the Django cache and restart your development server to ensure that all changes are applied. You might also want to clear your browser cache.\n\n7. **Check Django Version:**\n   If you're using an older version of Django, ensure that the syntax and features you're using are supported. The use of the `{% url %}` tag with named URL patterns is standard in Django 1.5 and later.\n\n8. **Debugging:**\n   If the issue persists, try adding some debug prints or logging to see if the `filter_by_led` view is being called as expected or if there are any issues in the request/response cycle.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and fix the issue with the URL reversal for your Django view. If you continue to face difficulties, consider sharing more details about your URL configuration and template code for further assistance."
