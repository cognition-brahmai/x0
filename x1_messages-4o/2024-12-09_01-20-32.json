        "content": "In pandas, DataFrames are generally immutable in terms of structure, meaning that operations like appending rows typically return a new DataFrame rather than modifying the original one in place. However, you can achieve an in-place-like behavior by using the `pandas.concat` function combined with the `df1` reassignment. Although this doesn't avoid creating a new DataFrame under the hood, it allows you to update `df1` directly.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrames\ndf1 = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2], 'B': [3, 4]})\ndf2 = pd.DataFrame({'A': [5, 6], 'B': [7, 8]})\n\n# Append df2 to df1\ndf1 = pd.concat([df1, df2], ignore_index=True)\n\n# Now df1 is modified\nprint(df1)\n```\n\nThis will \"append\" `df2` to `df1` by reassigning `df1` to the result of `pd.concat`. While you are technically creating a new DataFrame, `df1` itself is effectively updated to include the rows from `df2`.\n\nIf you are looking for a method that doesn't create a new DataFrame in memory (e.g., due to memory constraints), you might need to consider other strategies, such as using databases or working with smaller chunks of data at a time."
