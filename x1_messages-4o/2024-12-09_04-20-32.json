I'm using the following line in PyCharm and it's flagged by on-the-fly inspection with unresolved reference errors for each import, as they are underlined red:\n\n```python\nfrom numpy import tan, arcsin, arccos, arctan\n```\n\nHowever, the following imports do not cause any error or warning:\n\n```python\nfrom numpy import sin, cos, arctan2, sqrt, cross, pi\n```\n\nMy code runs fine without any errors or warnings. I usually depend on PyCharm's red errors as an indicator that my code might not work, but in this situation, it seems that PyCharm is incorrect. Why are some of numpy's functions recognized by PyCharm's introspection and others aren't? I am currently using Windows 7 64-bit, Python 2.7.5, PyCharm 3.1.2, and Numpy 1.8."

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing with PyCharm is likely due to its code inspection and autocompletion system not being fully synchronized with Numpy's dynamic attribute generation. This can sometimes cause PyCharm to incorrectly flag certain imports as unresolved references, even though they are valid and your code runs without issues. Here are some possible reasons and solutions:\n\n1. **Cached Indexing**: PyCharm maintains an index of your project files for faster access and code inspection. Sometimes this index can get out of sync, causing false positives in error reporting. You can try invalidating caches and restarting PyCharm:\n   - Go to `File` -> `Invalidate Caches / Restart...` -> `Invalidate and Restart`.\n\n2. **Interpreter Configuration**: Ensure that the correct Python interpreter is set in PyCharm and that it includes the Numpy library. Double-check by going to:\n   - `File` -> `Settings` -> `Project: <Your Project Name>` -> `Python Interpreter`.\n   - Make sure the interpreter is correctly set and includes Numpy.\n\n3. **Numpy Module Structure**: Numpy uses a lot of dynamic imports and aliasing in its module, which might not be fully captured by PyCharm's static analysis. This can result in some functions not being recognized, especially if they're imported dynamically or through C extensions.\n\n4. **PyCharm and Python Version Compatibility**: Ensure that the version of PyCharm you're using is compatible with Python 2.7.5. PyCharm 3.1.2 is quite old, and there might be compatibility issues that have been resolved in later versions.\n\n5. **Upgrade PyCharm and Python**: Consider upgrading both PyCharm and Python to more recent versions. Python 2.7 is no longer supported, and using a more recent version like Python 3.x could improve compatibility and performance.\n\n6. **Check for Updates**: Make sure both PyCharm and your Numpy installation are up to date. Sometimes, newer versions include bug fixes that resolve these kinds of issues.\n\n7. **Suppress Inspection for Specific Imports**: As a workaround, you can suppress the inspection for these specific imports if they're causing too much distraction:\n   - Place your cursor on the highlighted import, press `Alt + Enter`, and select `Suppress for statement` or `Suppress for file`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve or at least mitigate the unresolved reference errors in PyCharm related to Numpy imports."
