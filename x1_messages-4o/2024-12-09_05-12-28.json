I am able to log messages at the INFO level, as shown in the code below:\n\n```python\nimport logging\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.info('message')\n```\n\nHowever, I am unable to log messages at lower levels (DEBUG). The following DEBUG level logging code is not giving any output:\n\n```python\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.info('message')\n\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.debug('message')\n```\n\nWhy is the logger not working for lower levels and how can I make it work?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The issue you are encountering with the logging module in Python arises from the way the `basicConfig` function works. When you call `logging.basicConfig`, it configures the root logger only if it hasn't been configured yet. If you call it multiple times, it will only have an effect the first time. This means that after the initial configuration, subsequent calls to `basicConfig` are ignored unless you explicitly clear the existing configuration.\n\nIn your code, you're configuring the logging level to `INFO` first, which works as expected. However, when you try to configure it to `DEBUG`, it doesn't have any effect because the logger has already been configured.\n\nTo fix this, make sure to set the logging level to `DEBUG` from the start, or reset the logging configuration if needed. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\n# Set up logging at the DEBUG level from the beginning\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n# Now both INFO and DEBUG messages will be logged\nlogger.info('This is an info message')\nlogger.debug('This is a debug message')\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you need to reconfigure logging during runtime, you can reset the logging configuration by using the `handlers` attribute of the root logger:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\n# Initial setup to INFO level\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.info('This is an info message')\n\n# Reconfigure to DEBUG level\nfor handler in logging.root.handlers[:]:\n    logging.root.removeHandler(handler)\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\n\n# Now DEBUG messages will also be logged\nlogger.debug('This is a debug message')\n```\n\nBy ensuring the logging level is set to `DEBUG` from the beginning or reconfiguring properly, you will be able to see messages at all levels, including DEBUG."
