The `current_app` proxy points to the application handling the current request, allowing you to access its configuration, including the logger. Here's how you can use it within a blueprint:\n\nFirst, import the necessary components:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Blueprint, current_app\n```\n\nThen, you can create a blueprint and use the logger like this:\n\n```python\nexample_blueprint = Blueprint('example', __name__)\n\n@example_blueprint.route('/log')\ndef log_example():\n    # Access the application logger\n    current_app.logger.info('This is an informational message from the blueprint.')\n    return \"Logged an informational message!\"\n```\n\nBy using `current_app.logger`, you can write log messages that will be handled by the Flask application's logging configuration, allowing you to keep track of activities and errors within your blueprints."
