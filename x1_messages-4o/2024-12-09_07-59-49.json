        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"no such table: auth_user,\" typically indicates that the database migrations haven't been applied correctly, which is why Django can't find the required table. Since you're using a custom user model, there are specific steps you need to follow to ensure everything is set up correctly. Here are a few steps to help you resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure you have migrations for all apps:**\n   Since you're using a custom user model, you need to make sure that all migrations are created and applied, especially for the `auth` app.\n\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py makemigrations\n   python manage.py makemigrations books\n   ```\n\n2. **Apply migrations:**\n   Once migrations are created, you need to apply them to create the necessary tables in the database.\n\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py migrate\n   ```\n\n   This step is crucial because `migrate` will apply all the necessary migrations to create tables, including your custom user table.\n\n3. **Check the UserCreationForm:**\n   In your `views.py`, you're using `UserCreationForm` which, by default, expects `auth_user`. You need to ensure it uses your custom user model. You can do this by defining a custom form:\n\n   ```python\n   from django import forms\n   from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm\n   from .models import User\n\n   class CustomUserCreationForm(UserCreationForm):\n       class Meta(UserCreationForm.Meta):\n           model = User\n           fields = UserCreationForm.Meta.fields + ('account_balance',)\n   ```\n\n   Then, update your `register` view to use `CustomUserCreationForm`.\n\n   ```python\n   def register(request):\n       if request.method == 'POST':\n           form = CustomUserCreationForm(request.POST)\n           if form.is_valid():\n               new_user = form.save()\n               return HttpResponseRedirect(\"/accounts/profile/\")\n       else:\n           form = CustomUserCreationForm()\n       return render(request, \"registration/register.html\", {'form': form})\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify `AUTH_USER_MODEL`:**\n   Ensure that `AUTH_USER_MODEL` in your `settings.py` is correctly set to `'books.User'`, which it seems you have done.\n\n5. **Django version considerations:**\n   Ensure your Django version supports the features you are using. Since you mentioned using Django 1.7b4, consider upgrading to a stable release if possible and verify that your project's setup is compatible with the version.\n\n6. **Debugging:**\n   If issues persist, you may want to inspect the applied migrations in the database. You can do this by checking the `django_migrations` table in `db.sqlite3` using a database browser tool or querying directly from Django's shell.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the \"no such table: auth_user\" error. Remember, correctly applying migrations is key to ensuring that all necessary database tables are created."
