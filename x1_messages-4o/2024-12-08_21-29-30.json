        "content": "Suppose you have a SQL database named [database_name] and a table named [table_name]. To add a new column to this table, you can employ the ALTER TABLE statement and the ADD COLUMN clause in the SQL code. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to add a column named \"new_column\" to the \"example_table\":\nALTER TABLE [table_name]\nADD COLUMN new_column DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0.0 NOT NULL;\nThis code will add a new column of data type DECIMAL(10,2) to the [table_name] table, with a default value of 0.0 and not null constraint. You can change the data type, default value, and constraints to meet your specific needs. Remember to replace the table and column names accordingly."

        "content": "Your explanation of adding a new column to a SQL table using the `ALTER TABLE` and `ADD COLUMN` statements is correct. Here's a breakdown of the SQL statement you've provided:\n\n```sql\nALTER TABLE [table_name]\nADD COLUMN new_column DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0.0 NOT NULL;\n```\n\n- `ALTER TABLE [table_name]`: This command modifies the structure of the specified table. Replace `[table_name]` with the actual name of your table.\n\n- `ADD COLUMN new_column`: This part of the statement adds a new column named `new_column` to the table. Replace `new_column` with the desired name for your new column.\n\n- `DECIMAL(10,2)`: This specifies that the new column will have a decimal data type with a total of 10 digits, 2 of which are after the decimal point.\n\n- `DEFAULT 0.0`: This sets the default value for the new column to 0.0, meaning any new row inserted into the table will have this value for `new_column` unless specified otherwise.\n\n- `NOT NULL`: This constraint ensures that the column cannot contain NULL values, meaning every row must have a valid value for this column.\n\nMake sure to replace `[table_name]` with your actual table name and adjust the column name, data type, default value, and constraints as needed for your specific use case.
