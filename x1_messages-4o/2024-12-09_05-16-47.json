I am trying to install Theano library on my GTX 960 card which requires nvcc 7.0. Despite attempts to reinstall CUDA, the version of nvcc remains unchanged. Moreover, when I try to run the command apt-get install nvidida-cuda-toolkit, it only installs version 6.5. How can I update nvcc to version 7.0?"

        "content": "To update your CUDA installation to version 7.0 and ensure that `nvcc` reflects the correct version, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Remove Existing CUDA Toolkit**: First, you need to uninstall the existing CUDA toolkit to avoid any conflicts.\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get --purge remove nvidia-cuda-toolkit\n   sudo apt-get --purge remove cuda\n   ```\n\n2. **Download the CUDA 7.0 Toolkit**: Go to the [NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit Archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive) and download the CUDA 7.0 installer for your operating system.\n\n3. **Install CUDA 7.0**: Follow the installation instructions provided by NVIDIA. Typically, this involves running the downloaded installer script and following the prompts.\n\n4. **Update Environment Variables**: Ensure that your environment variables point to the new CUDA installation. Add the following lines to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` file:\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-7.0/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}\n   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-7.0/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}\n   ```\n\n   Then, source the file to apply the changes:\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bashrc\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify the Installation**: Check the version of `nvcc` to ensure it is updated:\n   ```bash\n   nvcc --version\n   ```\n\n6. **Check Symlinks**: Sometimes, older versions might still be linked. You can check and update the symbolic links to point to the correct version:\n   ```bash\n   sudo ln -sf /usr/local/cuda-7.0/bin/nvcc /usr/bin/nvcc\n   ```\n\n7. **Reboot the System**: Although not always necessary, rebooting can ensure that all changes take effect correctly.\n\nAfter completing these steps, your system should be using CUDA 7.0 with the correct version of `nvcc`. You can then proceed to install Theano or other libraries that depend on this version of CUDA."
