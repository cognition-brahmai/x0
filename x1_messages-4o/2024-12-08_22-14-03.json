        "content": "The following text contains several sentences with different levels of difficulty. Your task is to determine the overall level of difficulty of the text based on a combination of the complexity of the words and the length of the sentences.\nText: \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. However, the lazy dog is not interested in chasing the quick brown fox. Instead, it prefers to lie in the sun and take a nap. The sun feels warm on its fur, and the dog is very content.\"\nTo determine the level of difficulty, assign a value of 1-5 to each word based on its complexity (1 being the easiest and 5 being the most difficult). Then, add up the values for each sentence and divide by the length of the sentence (in words) to get the average complexity per word. Finally, average the values for all sentences to get the overall level of difficulty for the text.\nFor example, the first sentence might be assigned values of 3, 2, 4, 3, 3, 3, 4, and 3 (for \"The\", \"quick\", \"brown\", \"fox\", \"jumps\", \"over\", \"the\", and \"lazy\", respectively). If the sentence is 9 words long, the average complexity per word would be (3+2+4+3+3+3+4+3)/9 = 3.11. Repeat this process for all sentences and then take the average of all the average complexities to get the overall level of difficulty for the text.\nGood luck!"
