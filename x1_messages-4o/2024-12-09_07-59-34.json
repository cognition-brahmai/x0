        "content": "In Python, the `logging` module is used for tracking events that happen when some software runs. It provides a way to configure different log handlers and formatters to direct the log messages to various outputs like the console, files, etc.\n\nWhen you import `logging` using `import logging`, you are bringing in the core functionalities of the logging module. This includes creating loggers, setting log levels, and adding handlers to loggers.\n\nHowever, the `logging.config` is a sub-module within the `logging` package specifically designed to handle configuration tasks. This sub-module provides additional functionalities, such as:\n\n- Loading logging configurations from a file.\n- Applying configurations using a dictionary.\n- Offering a more flexible and scalable way to configure logging setups, especially in larger applications.\n\nThe error \"AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'config'\" occurs because `logging.config` is not automatically imported when you import `logging`. They are separate modules, and Python does not automatically import sub-modules.\n\nTo use the features provided by `logging.config`, you need to import it explicitly with `import logging.config`. This way, you can access functions like `logging.config.dictConfig()` or `logging.config.fileConfig()` to set up your logging configuration properly.\n\nIn summary, you need to import both `logging` and `logging.config` if you plan to use advanced configuration features provided by the `logging.config` sub-module."
