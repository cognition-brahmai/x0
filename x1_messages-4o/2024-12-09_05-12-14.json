        "content": "How can I prevent pandas from interpreting 'NA' as NaN (not a number) in a string? When using the read_csv() method to read my tab-delimited file, 'NA' is being converted to 'nan'. I've tried re-writing the file with quotes for data in the 'CHAIN' column and using the `quotechar` parameter, as well as passing a dictionary of types via the `dtype` parameter, but neither approach has worked. The suggestion to use a numpy record array to parse the file seems unnecessary now given the ability to specify column dtypes. \n\nHere is the sample tab-delimited file (sample.tsv):\n\n```\nPDB   CHAIN   SP_PRIMARY  RES_BEG RES_END PDB_BEG PDB_END SP_BEG  SP_END\n5d8b  N   P60490  1   146 1   146 1   146\n5d8b  NA  P80377  1   126 1   126 1   126\n5d8b  O   P60491  1   118 1   118 1   118\n```\n\nAnd here is the Python code (read_sample.py):\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\n    'sample.tsv',\n    sep='\\t',\n    encoding='utf-8',\n)\n\nfor df_tuples in df.itertuples(index=True):\n    print(df_tuples)\n```\n\nThe output is:\n\n```\n(0, u'5d8b', u'N', u'P60490', 1, 146, 1, 146, 1, 146)\n(1, u'5d8b', nan, u'P80377', 1, 126, 1, 126, 1, 126)\n(2, u'5d8b', u'O', u'P60491', 1, 118, 1, 118, 1, 118)\n```\n\nIs there a way to capture a valid string 'NA' instead of it being converted to nan?"

        "content": "To prevent pandas from interpreting 'NA' as NaN when reading your tab-delimited file, you can use the `na_values` parameter in the `read_csv` method. By specifying `na_values`, you can control which strings are treated as missing values. Since 'NA' is a common representation of missing data in many files, pandas automatically interprets it as NaN. You can override this behavior by explicitly telling pandas not to consider 'NA' as a missing value.\n\nHere's how you can modify your `read_sample.py` code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\n    'sample.tsv',\n    sep='\\t',\n    encoding='utf-8',\n    na_values=[],  # Specify an empty list to prevent any string from being treated as NaN\n    keep_default_na=False  # Disable default NA values\n)\n\nfor df_tuples in df.itertuples(index=True):\n    print(df_tuples)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- `na_values=[]`: By providing an empty list to `na_values`, you specify that no strings should be considered as NaN.\n- `keep_default_na=False`: This parameter tells pandas not to use its default list of missing value identifiers, which includes 'NA'.\n\nThis approach ensures that 'NA' in your 'CHAIN' column is read as a regular string rather than being converted to NaN."
