I have a package \"A\" with a setup.py and an 'extras_requires' line like 'extras_require = {'ssh': ['paramiko']},'. There's also a package \"B\" that depends on util with 'install_requires = ['A[ssh]']'. The 'extras_requires' is correctly resolved and paramiko is installed when I run 'python setup.py install' on package B, which uses 'setuptools.command.easy_install' underneath. However, when I run 'pip /path/to/B' or 'pip hxxp://.../b-version.tar.gz', package A gets installed, but paramiko does not, even though pip should be invoking the setup.py of B and then resolving and installing dependencies of both B and A. Is this functionality possible with pip?"

        "content": "Yes, `pip` does handle `extras_require` from setuptools-based sources, but there are some nuances to be aware of. If you have a package \"A\" with an `extras_require` option like `{'ssh': ['paramiko']}`, and package \"B\" that depends on \"A\" using `install_requires = ['A[ssh]']`, pip should be able to resolve and install the extra dependencies, such as `paramiko`, when you install package \"B\".\n\nWhen you run `pip install /path/to/B` or `pip install hxxp://.../b-version.tar.gz`, pip should indeed look at package B's `setup.py`, determine that it needs \"A[ssh]\", and then install both \"A\" and the additional `paramiko` package.\n\nHowever, there could be a few reasons why this might not be working as expected:\n\n1. **Package Index and Versioning**: Ensure that the package index (such as PyPI or a custom index) where pip is pulling \"A\" from actually has the version of \"A\" that includes the `extras_require` specification. If the index has an older version of \"A\" that doesn't include `extras_require`, pip won't be able to resolve it.\n\n2. **Local Paths and Editable Installs**: If you're using local paths or editable installs (with `-e`), make sure the path to package \"A\" and its setup.py is correct and accessible. Sometimes local path issues can cause pip not to recognize the extras.\n\n3. **Pip Version**: Make sure you're using an updated version of pip. Older versions of pip had various quirks and bugs related to dependency resolution and `extras_require`.\n\n4. **Dependency Resolution**: Pip's dependency resolver has improved over time, but there can still be edge cases where it doesn't behave as expected, especially if there are complex or conflicting dependencies.\n\nIf you have verified the above points and the issue persists, you might want to try creating a minimal reproducible example and checking in a virtual environment to ensure there are no environmental issues affecting the installation. Additionally, you can enable verbose output during pip installation with `pip install -vvv ...` to get more insights into what might be going wrong during the dependency resolution process."
