The `2to3` utility in Python 2.6 doesn't appropriately convert `chr` calls which is problematic. I need this function for parsing and serializing a file format that is explicitly defined in terms of 8-bit bytes. How can I achieve this in Python 3?"

        "content": "In Python 3, the `chr()` function still exists, but it now returns a Unicode string representing a character, rather than a byte string. To achieve the functionality you are looking for, where you need a byte string with a single character with a specific numeric value (as was done using `chr()` in Python 2.x), you can use the `bytes` type or the `bytearray` type in Python 3.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can accomplish this:\n\n1. **Using `bytes` constructor**: You can create a bytes object that contains a single byte using the `bytes` constructor. You simply pass a list or tuple with a single integer (within the range of 0 to 255).\n\n   ```python\n   def byte_chr(num):\n       return bytes([num])\n\n   # Example usage\n   byte_value = byte_chr(65)\n   print(byte_value)  # Output: b'A'\n   ```\n\n2. **Using `bytearray` constructor**: Similarly, you can use `bytearray` if you need a mutable sequence of bytes.\n\n   ```python\n   def byte_chr(num):\n       return bytearray([num])\n\n   # Example usage\n   byte_array_value = byte_chr(65)\n   print(byte_array_value)  # Output: bytearray(b'A')\n   ```\n\nBoth methods will give you a byte-like object with a single character corresponding to the numeric value you provide, preserving the 8-bit byte semantics necessary for parsing and serializing your file format."
