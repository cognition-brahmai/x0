Even though I've turned off SSL verifications and warnings using the following code:\n\n```python\nrequests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings()\npage = requests.get(url, verify=False)\n```\n\nI still receive an SSL error which I can't resolve. The error is as follows:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"scraper.py\", line 6, in &lt;module&gt;\n    page = requests.get(url, verify=False)\n  File \"/cygdrive/c/Users/jfeocco/VirtualEnv/scraping/lib/python3.4/site-packages/requests/api.py\", line 71, in get\n    return request('get', url, params=params, **kwargs)\n  File \"/cygdrive/c/Users/jfeocco/VirtualEnv/scraping/lib/python3.4/site-packages/requests/api.py\", line 57, in request\n    return session.request(method=method, url=url, **kwargs)\n  File \"/cygdrive/c/Users/jfeocco/VirtualEnv/scraping/lib/python3.4/site-packages/requests/sessions.py\", line 475, in request\n    resp = self.send(prep, **send_kwargs)\n  File \"/cygdrive/c/Users/jfeocco/VirtualEnv/scraping/lib/python3.4/site-packages/requests/sessions.py\", line 585, in send\n    r = adapter.send(request, **kwargs)\n  File \"/cygdrive/c/Users/jfeocco/VirtualEnv/scraping/lib/python3.4/site-packages/requests/adapters.py\", line 477, in send\n    raise SSLError(e, request=request)\nrequests.exceptions.SSLError: [SSL: SSL_NEGATIVE_LENGTH] dh key too small (_ssl.c:600)\n```\n\nThis error occurs in both Cygwin on Windows and on OSX. My research suggests that the server might be using an outdated version of OpenSSL. However, I am looking for a client-side solution. How can I solve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, `SSL_NEGATIVE_LENGTH`, typically relates to the server's SSL configuration, specifically the Diffie-Hellman key size being too small which may be considered insecure by your client-side SSL library. If updating the server's OpenSSL configuration is not possible, you can try the following client-side solutions:\n\n1. **Upgrade Your Python and OpenSSL Libraries**: Ensure that both your Python version and OpenSSL libraries are updated to the latest versions, as they might have improved compatibility with legacy SSL configurations.\n\n2. **Adjust SSL Context**: You can create a custom SSL context that might be more lenient or support weaker ciphers. Here's an example of how you might do this:\n\n    ```python\n    import requests\n    from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter\n    from urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager\n    import ssl\n\n    class SSLAdapter(HTTPAdapter):\n        def __init__(self, ssl_context=None, **kwargs):\n            self.ssl_context = ssl_context\n            super().__init__(**kwargs)\n\n        def init_poolmanager(self, *args, **kwargs):\n            kwargs['ssl_context'] = self.ssl_context\n            return super().init_poolmanager(*args, **kwargs)\n\n    # Create a custom SSL context\n    ssl_context = ssl.create_default_context()\n    ssl_context.set_ciphers('DEFAULT:@SECLEVEL=1')  # Lower security level\n\n    session = requests.Session()\n    session.mount('https://', SSLAdapter(ssl_context))\n\n    try:\n        response = session.get(url, verify=False)\n        print(response.content)\n    except requests.exceptions.SSLError as e:\n        print(f\"SSL Error: {e}\")\n    ```\n\n    This approach manually sets the security level to 1, which might allow connections that are otherwise rejected due to weak DH key sizes.\n\n3. **Use a Different Library**: If the `requests` library continues to cause issues, you might try using a different library like `http.client` in Python's standard library or `pycurl`, which might handle SSL connections differently.\n\n4. **Check for Proxy Settings**: Sometimes proxy settings or middleboxes can affect SSL negotiation. Ensure that your environment variables or network settings are not causing the issue.\n\n5. **Contact Server Administrator**: If possible, reach out to the server administrator to see if they can update the server's SSL configuration to be more compatible with modern clients.\n\nRemember, lowering security settings can expose your application to risks, so use these solutions with caution and only if you're sure it's safe to do so."
