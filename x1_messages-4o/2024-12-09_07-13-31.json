I want this TestCase to contain some test_* methods, but I want these methods to only be used in subclasses and not be called in the abstract TestCase. The reason for this is that I plan to have one abstract TestCase in my test suite and it will be subclassed for a few different implementations of a single interface. As all test methods are the same, only one internal method changes. How can I elegantly achieve this?"

        "content": "Yes, you can create an abstract `TestCase` in Python's `unittest` framework by using the `abc` module to define abstract methods. This allows you to define a base `TestCase` with methods that should not be directly instantiated, ensuring that they are only used in subclasses. Here\u2019s how you can achieve this:\n\n1. Use the `abc` module to create an abstract base class.\n2. Define abstract methods that subclasses must implement.\n3. Implement common test methods in the abstract `TestCase`.\n4. Ensure the abstract test methods are overridden in the subclasses.\n\nBelow is an example to illustrate how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\nfrom abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n\nclass AbstractTestCase(unittest.TestCase, ABC):\n    @abstractmethod\n    def get_implementation(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Subclasses must override this method to return the specific implementation\n        they are testing.\n        \"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def test_feature_one(self):\n        impl = self.get_implementation()\n        # Perform tests using impl\n        self.assertTrue(impl.do_something())\n\n    def test_feature_two(self):\n        impl = self.get_implementation()\n        # Perform tests using impl\n        self.assertEqual(impl.do_something_else(), expected_value)\n\n# Example of a concrete implementation\nclass ConcreteTestCaseA(AbstractTestCase):\n    def get_implementation(self):\n        return ImplementationA()\n\nclass ConcreteTestCaseB(AbstractTestCase):\n    def get_implementation(self):\n        return ImplementationB()\n\n# Example implementation classes\nclass ImplementationA:\n    def do_something(self):\n        return True\n\n    def do_something_else(self):\n        return 'A'\n\nclass ImplementationB:\n    def do_something(self):\n        return True\n\n    def do_something_else(self):\n        return 'B'\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\nIn this setup:\n\n- `AbstractTestCase` is an abstract base class that defines the structure for test cases.\n- `get_implementation` is an abstract method that subclasses must implement to provide the specific implementation they are testing.\n- The `test_feature_one` and `test_feature_two` methods use the implementation returned by `get_implementation` for testing.\n- `ConcreteTestCaseA` and `ConcreteTestCaseB` are concrete subclasses that provide specific implementations for testing.\n\nThis approach ensures that the abstract test methods are never executed directly and are only used when a concrete subclass instantiates them."
