I also attempted to use suds, but it breaks with certain types and gives a \"suds.TypeNotFound: Type not found: 'item'\" error. The Client module doesn't appear to support WSDL and the ZSI module seems very complex. Does anyone have a solution or sample code for this? The WSDL I'm trying to use is https://ws.pingdom.com/soap/PingdomAPI.wsdl and it works fine with the PHP 5 SOAP client."

        "content": "To work with a WSDL SOAP-based web service in Python, especially when dealing with compatibility issues with certain libraries like `SOAPpy` or `suds`, you might want to try using `zeep`, a modern SOAP client for Python that supports WSDL. `zeep` is well-maintained and provides a more Pythonic way to interact with SOAP services.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to use `zeep` to interact with the Pingdom API:\n\n1. **Install `zeep`:** First, you need to install the `zeep` library. You can do this using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install zeep\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a Python script to use the SOAP service:**\n\n   ```python\n   from zeep import Client\n\n   # Specify the WSDL URL\n   wsdl_url = 'https://ws.pingdom.com/soap/PingdomAPI.wsdl'\n\n   # Create a zeep client\n   client = Client(wsdl=wsdl_url)\n\n   # Example: Call a method from the SOAP service\n   # You might need to refer to the service's documentation for specific method names and parameters\n   try:\n       # Replace 'your_method_name' with the actual method name from the WSDL\n       # and provide necessary arguments. This is just a placeholder.\n       response = client.service.your_method_name(argument1='value1', argument2='value2')\n       print(response)\n   except Exception as e:\n       print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Access the Methods and Services:**\n\n   To see the available operations, you can use:\n\n   ```python\n   print(client.service)\n   ```\n\n   This will list all the operations defined in the WSDL, allowing you to understand what methods you can call and what parameters they require.\n\n4. **Debugging and Troubleshooting:**\n\n   If you encounter any issues, make sure to check:\n\n   - The WSDL URL is accessible and correct.\n   - The method names and parameters match those expected by the service.\n   - Any authentication or headers required by the service are properly included.\n\n`zeep` provides a powerful and flexible way to interact with SOAP services, and it should work well with the Pingdom API. If you have any specific methods you want to call or need further assistance with `zeep`, please let me know!"
