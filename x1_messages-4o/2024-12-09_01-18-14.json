For instance, if my two lists are as follows:\n\n```python\nfirst_list = [1, 2, 2, 5]\nsecond_list = [2, 5, 7, 9]\n```\n\nThe result should be:\n\n```python\nresulting_list = [1, 2, 2, 5, 7, 9]\n```\n\nThe first list includes two \"2\" values, and even though the second list also has an additional 2 and 5, they are not added to the first list. I'd normally use sets for this, but a set would remove the duplicate values in the first list. What's the best or fastest way to achieve this?"

        "content": "To achieve this, you can use a combination of list operations and a set for efficient membership testing. Here's a step-by-step approach to combine the two lists while preserving duplicates in the first list and ignoring duplicates from the second list that already exist in the first list:\n\n1. Create a set from the first list to easily check for duplicates.\n2. Iterate over the second list and add elements to the first list only if they are not already present in the set created from the first list.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfirst_list = [1, 2, 2, 5]\nsecond_list = [2, 5, 7, 9]\n\n# Create a set from the first list for fast membership testing\nexisting_elements = set(first_list)\n\n# Iterate over the second list and add elements to the first list if they are not in the set\nfor item in second_list:\n    if item not in existing_elements:\n        first_list.append(item)\n        existing_elements.add(item)\n\n# The first list is now the resulting list\nresulting_list = first_list\n\nprint(resulting_list)\n```\n\nHere's what happens in the code:\n- You first convert `first_list` into a set called `existing_elements` to keep track of elements that are already present.\n- You then iterate over each element in `second_list`. For each element, you check if it is not in `existing_elements`.\n- If an element is not in `existing_elements`, you append it to `first_list` and also add it to `existing_elements` to ensure any further duplicates in `second_list` are ignored.\n\nThis approach efficiently combines the lists while maintaining the required conditions."
