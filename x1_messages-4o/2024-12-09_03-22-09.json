        "content": "How can I split an iterable into constant-size chunks in Python? I am trying to create a function called \"batch\" that takes an iterable as input and returns an iterable of iterables. For example, when I input a range from 0 to 10 and specify the size as 3, I expect the output to be [[0,1,2], [3,4,5], [6,7,8], [9]]. However, my current implementation is not giving the expected result. Here's what I have so far:\n\n```python\ndef batch(iterable, n = 1):\n   current_batch = []\n   for item in iterable:\n       current_batch.append(item)\n       if len(current_batch) == n:\n           yield current_batch\n           current_batch = []\n   if current_batch:\n       yield current_batch\n```\n\nWhen I run the function with a range from 0 to 10 and size 3, the result is:\n\n```python\nfor x in   batch(range(0,10),3): print x\n[0]\n[0, 1]\n[0, 1, 2]\n[3]\n[3, 4]\n[3, 4, 5]\n[6]\n[6, 7]\n[6, 7, 8]\n[9]\n```\n\nI realize that this issue arises only when I run this within ipython rather than python itself. What am I doing wrong and how can I fix this?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is likely due to how the `print` function is being used in your environment, rather than a problem with the logic of the `batch` function itself. The function you provided should work correctly in both standard Python and IPython environments.\n\nHowever, if you're using Python 2.x, the `print` statement should be adjusted to properly display the output in IPython. In Python 2.x, `print` is not a function, so parentheses around the argument are interpreted differently.\n\nIf you're using Python 3.x, your code should work as expected. Let me provide you with a refined version of the code that should work in both Python 2 and 3 (and IPython as well):\n\n```python\ndef batch(iterable, n=1):\n    current_batch = []\n    for item in iterable:\n        current_batch.append(item)\n        if len(current_batch) == n:\n            yield current_batch\n            current_batch = []\n    if current_batch:\n        yield current_batch\n\n# Usage example\nfor x in batch(range(0, 10), 3):\n    print(x)  # Use print(x) in Python 3 or print x in Python 2\n```\n\nIf you are using Python 2, make sure to run the code with `print x` instead of `print(x)`:\n\n```python\nfor x in batch(range(0, 10), 3):\n    print x  # Use this line in Python 2\n```\n\nIf you are running this in IPython and still facing issues, try resetting the kernel or restarting IPython to clear any cached state that might affect the output. Additionally, check if there are any modifications or configurations in your IPython environment that might be affecting how the output is displayed."
