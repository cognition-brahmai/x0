        "content": "Creating a recursive function in Python involves defining a function that calls itself within its own definition. Recursive functions are typically used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems. Here's a basic example using the calculation of a factorial, which is a classic application of recursion:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    # Base case: if n is 0, the factorial is 1\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n\n# Example usage\nprint(factorial(5))  # Output: 120\n```\n\n### Key Components of a Recursive Function:\n\n1. **Base Case:** This is crucial to avoid infinite recursion. The base case is a condition under which the recursion stops. In the factorial example, the base case is when `n` is 0.\n\n2. **Recursive Case:** This is where the function calls itself with a modified argument, moving towards the base case. In the factorial example, the recursive case is `n * factorial(n - 1)`.\n\n### Important Considerations:\n\n- **Ensure a Base Case:** Every recursive function must have a base case to stop recursion; otherwise, you\u2019ll encounter a `RecursionError` due to infinite recursion.\n  \n- **Stack Overflow:** Be aware that Python has a recursion limit (typically around 1,000 calls), so very deep recursion can lead to a stack overflow. You can modify the recursion limit using `sys.setrecursionlimit()`, but doing so can be risky.\n\n- **Efficiency:** Recursive solutions can be less efficient than iterative solutions due to the overhead of repeated function calls and maintaining the call stack.\n\nHere's another example, calculating the nth Fibonacci number:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    # Base cases\n    if n <= 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    # Recursive case\n    else:\n        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)\n\n# Example usage\nprint(fibonacci(5))  # Output: 5\n```\n\nThis function calculates the nth Fibonacci number using recursion. Notice how it has two base cases: when `n` is 0 and when `n` is 1. The recursive case sums the results of the two previous Fibonacci numbers."
