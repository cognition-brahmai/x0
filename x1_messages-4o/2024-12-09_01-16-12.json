They seem quite similar to me, and I've noticed that `yield_fixture` has better readability. However, I'm unsure about their exact differences. Could someone explain to me what the key differences between these two are and which one I should use in scenarios like the following:\n\n```python\n@pytest.fixture()\ndef open_browser(request):\n    print(\"Browser opened\")\n\n    def close_browser():\n        print(\"browser closed\")\n\n    request.addfinalizer(close_browser)\n\n    return \"browser object\"\n\n@pytest.yield_fixture()\ndef open_browser():\n    print(\"Browser opened\")\n    yield \"browser object\"\n    print(\"browser closed\")\n\n\ndef test_google_search(open_browser):\n    print(open_browser)\n    print(\"test_google_search\")\n```"

        "content": "The confusion between `fixture` and `yield_fixture` in pytest is quite common, especially for those who are new to using pytest fixtures. Let's break down the differences and provide guidance on which one to use.\n\n### Key Differences\n\n1. **Syntax and Usage**:\n   - `@pytest.fixture`: This decorator is used to define a fixture using the standard setup and teardown pattern. You manually specify any teardown logic using `request.addfinalizer` or by using `try/finally` blocks.\n   - `@pytest.yield_fixture`: This was an alternative way to define fixtures using a generator pattern, where the code before the `yield` statement is the setup, and the code after the `yield` is the teardown. \n\n2. **Readability**:\n   - `yield_fixture` provides a more readable and concise way to manage setup and teardown because it clearly separates setup and teardown logic using the `yield` statement.\n\n3. **Deprecation**:\n   - `@pytest.yield_fixture` has been deprecated as of pytest 3.0. The capability to use `yield` was integrated into the `@pytest.fixture` decorator, making `yield_fixture` redundant. Now, you can simply use `@pytest.fixture` with a `yield` statement to achieve the same effect.\n\n### Recommendations\n\nGiven the deprecation of `yield_fixture`, the recommended approach is to use `@pytest.fixture` with a `yield` statement. This provides the benefits of both readability and the latest pytest features.\n\nHere's how you can use `@pytest.fixture` with `yield`:\n\n```python\n@pytest.fixture()\ndef open_browser():\n    print(\"Browser opened\")\n    yield \"browser object\"\n    print(\"browser closed\")\n```\n\nUsing this method, you get the readability of the `yield` keyword, along with the current and future support of pytest. It is clean, straightforward, and follows the modern convention in pytest.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor your scenarios and any future tests, use `@pytest.fixture` with a `yield` statement for both readability and to conform to the latest pytest best practices. This way, you ensure that your code remains compatible and clear."
