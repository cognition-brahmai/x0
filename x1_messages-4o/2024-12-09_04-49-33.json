When I query the database, the documents returned contain an \"_id\" field which I don't want to send to the client. How can I remove this field from the results? My initial attempts using the \"del\" keyword resulted in a TypeError, and iterating over the results to create a new dictionary without the _id field only returned a dictionary with the first-level keys. According to the MongoDB and Pymongo documentation, it seems there is no straightforward way to exclude the _id field. Is there something I am missing?\n\nHere is my initial Flask route:\n\n```python\n@app.route('/theobjects')\ndef index():\n    objects = db.collection.find()\n    return str(json.dumps({'results': list(objects)}, \n        default = json_util.default,\n        indent = 4))\n```\n\nMy attempt to delete the _id field:\n\n```python\ndel objects['_id']\n```\n\nThe TypeError it returned:\n\n```python\nTypeError: 'Cursor' object does not support item deletion\n```\n\nAnd my attempt to iterate over the results:\n\n```python\nnew_object = {}\nfor object in objects:\n    for key, item in objects.items():\n        if key == '_id':\n            del object['_id']\n            new_object.update(object)\n```"

        "content": "In MongoDB, when using the PyMongo driver, you can modify your query to exclude fields directly using a projection. This means you can specify which fields to include or exclude in your query results. In your case, you want to exclude the `_id` field from the documents being returned from the database. Here's how you can do it:\n\nModify your Flask route to use a projection to exclude the `_id` field:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import jsonify\nfrom bson import json_util\n\n@app.route('/theobjects')\ndef index():\n    # Use projection to exclude the _id field\n    objects = db.collection.find({}, {'_id': 0})\n\n    # Convert cursor to a list and jsonify the response\n    results = list(objects)\n    return jsonify({'results': results})\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Projection in MongoDB**: The second argument to the `find` method is the projection. By specifying `{'_id': 0}`, you're telling MongoDB to exclude the `_id` field from the returned documents.\n\n2. **JSON Conversion**: Use `jsonify` from Flask instead of `json.dumps` to automatically handle conversion of the list to a JSON response. This is more efficient and handles setting the correct content type headers.\n\n3. **Cursor Iteration**: `find` returns a cursor, which is iterable. The `list(objects)` conversion is necessary to turn the cursor into a list so that it can be serialized by `jsonify`.\n\nThis approach should resolve the issues you're facing with the `_id` field and avoids the need for manually deleting the field from each document."
