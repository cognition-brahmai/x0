Currently the function iterates over a global dictionary named `cal` and prints the values. However, I need to return these values to another function for a Discord bot. My attempt to use `return` within the loop is only returning a single key-value pair instead of all the data. The code I'm using is as follows:\n```python\ndef show_todo():\n    for key, value in cal.items():\n        print(value[0], key)\n```\nI have also tried to fix it using return like this:\n```python\ndef show_todo():\n    for key, value in cal.items():\n        return(value[0], key)\n```\nBut this only returns at most one key-value pair from the dictionary. How can I modify this function to return all the data?"

        "content": "To return multiple values from a loop, you can accumulate the results in a list and then return that list once the loop is complete. In your `show_todo()` function, you should collect each key-value pair in a list and return the list after the loop finishes iterating over the dictionary. Here's how you can modify your function to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef show_todo():\n    results = []  # List to store the key-value pairs\n    \n    for key, value in cal.items():\n        results.append((value[0], key))  # Append each key-value pair to the list\n    \n    return results  # Return the list after the loop\n\n# Example usage:\ncal = {\n    '2023-10-01': ['Task 1'],\n    '2023-10-02': ['Task 2'],\n    '2023-10-03': ['Task 3']\n}\n\ntodo_items = show_todo()\nprint(todo_items)  # This will print the list of tuples with (value, key)\n```\n\nIn this code, `results` is a list that accumulates each `(value[0], key)` tuple during the iteration over `cal.items()`. After the loop is complete, the function returns the `results` list containing all the tuples, which can then be used by your Discord bot or any other part of your program."
