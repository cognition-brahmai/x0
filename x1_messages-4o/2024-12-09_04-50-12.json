The output suggests that `make_italic` runs first, followed by `make_bold`. Is it correct to say that with decorated functions, the decorators are applied from the bottom up, rather than from the top down? Is the order of application of decorators different from the usual top-down approach in most programming languages?\n\nHere is the code I'm working with:\n\n```python\ndef make_bold(fn):\n    return lambda : \"<b>\" + fn() + \"</b>\"\n\ndef make_italic(fn):\n    return lambda : \"<i>\" + fn() + \"</i>\"\n\n@make_bold\n@make_italic\ndef hello():\n  return \"hello world\"\n\nhelloHTML = hello()\n```\n\nThe output I'm getting is: `\"<b><i>hello world</i></b>\"`."

        "content": "Yes, your observation is correct regarding the order in which decorators are applied in Python. When multiple decorators are applied to a function, they are executed from the bottom up. This means that the decorator closest to the function (i.e., the one applied directly to the function) is executed first, and then the decorator above it wraps the result.\n\nIn your code:\n\n```python\n@make_bold\n@make_italic\ndef hello():\n    return \"hello world\"\n```\n\nThe `hello` function is first passed to `make_italic`, which returns a new function that wraps the original `hello` function. This new function is then passed to `make_bold`, which wraps the already wrapped function.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what happens:\n\n1. `@make_italic` is applied to `hello`, so it returns a new function that wraps the original `hello` function's output with `<i></i>`.\n2. The resulting function from step 1 is then passed to `@make_bold`, which further wraps its output with `<b></b>`.\n\nTherefore, when you call `hello()`, it first executes the innermost function (the one returned by `make_italic`), and then the outermost one (the one returned by `make_bold`), resulting in the output `\"<b><i>hello world</i></b>\"`.\n\nThis bottom-up application of decorators is indeed a bit different from the typical top-down approach you might expect in other contexts, but it's how Python decorators are designed to work."
