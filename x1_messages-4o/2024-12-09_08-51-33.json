        "content": "Certainly! You can use Python to find the number of unique countries in a list by utilizing a set, which automatically handles duplicates. Here's a simple program to do that:\n\n```python\ndef count_unique_countries(country_list):\n    # Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates\n    unique_countries = set(country_list)\n    \n    # Return the count of unique countries\n    return len(unique_countries)\n\n# Example usage\ncountries = [\"India\", \"USA\", \"Brazil\", \"India\", \"China\", \"USA\", \"France\"]\nunique_count = count_unique_countries(countries)\nprint(\"Number of unique countries:\", unique_count)\n```\n\nIn this program, `set(country_list)` creates a set of unique countries from the list, and `len(unique_countries)` gives the number of unique countries. You can replace the `countries` list with your own list to find the number of unique countries in it."
