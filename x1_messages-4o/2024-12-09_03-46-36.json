        "content": "Certainly! The issue in your script lies in the way the `grep` command is being invoked within the `if` statement. The command is currently enclosed in single quotes and is not being executed properly. Instead, it is being treated as a string literal.\n\nHere's how you can modify the script to correctly check if a file contains a specific string using `grep`:\n\n```bash\nif grep -q \"SomeString\" \"$File\"; then\n   # Some Actions\nfi\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Command Execution**: The `grep` command should not be enclosed in single quotes. Instead, it should be executed directly.\n   \n2. **`-q` Option**: The `-q` (quiet) option tells `grep` to run in quiet mode, which means it will not output anything. Instead, it will return a success exit status (0) if the string is found, which is suitable for conditional checks.\n\n3. **Variable Expansion**: Make sure that the `$File` variable is properly expanded by enclosing it in double quotes. This is especially important if the file path contains spaces or special characters.\n\nUsing this corrected script, the `if` statement will execute the actions inside the block if `SomeString` is found in the file specified by `$File`."
