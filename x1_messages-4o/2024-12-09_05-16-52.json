        "content": "I am trying to convert a standard JSON object into an object where each line contains a separate, self-contained valid JSON object. This is also known as JSON Lines format. Here is the JSON object I am working with:\n\n```\nJSON_file =\n[{u'index': 1,\n  u'no': 'A',\n  u'met': u'1043205'},\n {u'index': 2,\n  u'no': 'B',\n  u'met': u'000031043206'},\n {u'index': 3,\n  u'no': 'C',\n  u'met': u'0031043207'}]\n```\n\nAnd I want to convert it to:\n\n```\n{u'index': 1, u'no': 'A', u'met': u'1043205'}\n{u'index': 2, u'no': 'B', u'met': u'031043206'}\n{u'index': 3, u'no': 'C', u'met': u'0031043207'}\n```\n\nMy current solution involves reading the JSON file as a text file and removing the '[' from the beginning and the ']' from the end. This creates a valid JSON object on each line, rather than a nested object containing lines. However, I feel this method is a bit crude and am wondering if there is a more elegant solution to this problem. I suspect that using string manipulation on the file may lead to some issues. Also, I need this conversion because I want to read json files into RDD on Spark."

        "content": "Converting a JSON array into JSON Lines (or NDJSON) format is a common task when working with data in distributed systems like Apache Spark. Your current approach is understandable, but there are more elegant ways to achieve this using programming languages like Python. Here's a Python solution using the `json` module:\n\n1. **Read the JSON Object:**\n\n   First, you need to read the JSON object from the file or a string.\n\n2. **Convert Each Element to a JSON Line:**\n\n   Iterate over each element in the JSON array and convert it into a single JSON object string.\n\n3. **Write to a File or Print:**\n\n   Write each JSON object string to a new line in your output file or simply print it.\n\nHere's a sample Python script to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Sample JSON data\nJSON_file = [\n    {u'index': 1, u'no': 'A', u'met': u'1043205'},\n    {u'index': 2, u'no': 'B', u'met': u'000031043206'},\n    {u'index': 3, u'no': 'C', u'met': u'0031043207'}\n]\n\n# Open a file to write JSON Lines\nwith open('output.jsonl', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n    for item in JSON_file:\n        json_line = json.dumps(item, ensure_ascii=False)\n        f.write(json_line + '\\n')\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- The `json.dumps()` method serializes a Python object (like a dictionary) into a JSON formatted string.\n- `ensure_ascii=False` is used to maintain the Unicode characters as is, which is useful in your example where you have Unicode strings.\n- Each JSON object is written to a new line in the output file `output.jsonl`.\n\nThis script will create an `output.jsonl` file where each line is a self-contained JSON object, suitable for processing in Apache Spark or other systems that require the JSON Lines format.\n\nIf you are using another programming language or environment, the approach will be similar: parse the JSON, iterate over the items, convert each to a string, and write to a file line by line."
