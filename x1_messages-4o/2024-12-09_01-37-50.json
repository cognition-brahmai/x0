Is it possible to use an application built with Python 3 in lambda, and not just Python 2.7? I am exploring options and came across this: https://gun.io/blog/announcing-zappa-serverless-python-aws-lambda/. Could you provide an example code which I could try for Python 3.0 with lambda?"

        "content": "Yes, you can definitely use Python 3 with AWS Lambda. As of now, AWS Lambda supports several Python runtimes, including Python 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. The documentation you came across might be outdated if it only mentions Python 2.7.\n\nTo deploy a Python 3 application on AWS Lambda, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set Up Your Environment:**\n   Make sure you have AWS CLI installed and configured with your credentials.\n\n2. **Create a Lambda Function:**\n   You can create a Lambda function from the AWS Management Console, selecting Python 3.8, 3.9, or 3.10 as the runtime.\n\n3. **Example Code:**\n   Below is a simple example of a Lambda function written in Python 3.8. It just returns a basic JSON response.\n\n   ```python\n   def lambda_handler(event, context):\n       return {\n           'statusCode': 200,\n           'body': 'Hello from Lambda!'\n       }\n   ```\n\n4. **Deploy the Code:**\n   You can package your code as a .zip file and upload it directly via the AWS Management Console. Alternatively, you can use AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) or the Serverless Framework for more complex applications.\n\n   If you're using the AWS CLI, you can deploy your function using the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   aws lambda create-function --function-name myPython3Function \\\n   --zip-file fileb://function.zip --handler lambda_function.lambda_handler \\\n   --runtime python3.8 --role arn:aws:iam::account-id:role/execution-role\n   ```\n\n5. **Using Zappa:**\n   Zappa is a great tool if you want to deploy Python web applications to AWS Lambda. It simplifies the process of deploying and managing serverless applications.\n\n   Here's a quick start guide for using Zappa:\n\n   - Install Zappa:\n\n     ```bash\n     pip install zappa\n     ```\n\n   - Initialize Zappa in your project directory:\n\n     ```bash\n     zappa init\n     ```\n\n     This command will guide you through setting up your Zappa configuration.\n\n   - Deploy your application:\n\n     ```bash\n     zappa deploy\n     ```\n\n   Zappa will handle packaging your code, creating the necessary AWS resources, and deploying your application to AWS Lambda.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully deploy a Python 3 application on AWS Lambda.
