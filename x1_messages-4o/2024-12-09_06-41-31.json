        "content": "To obtain the current learning rate during the training process in PyTorch, you can access it from the optimizer's parameter groups. Each parameter group in an optimizer can have its own learning rate, and you can access it using the `param_groups` attribute of the optimizer. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Assuming 'my_optimizer' is your optimizer\nfor param_group in my_optimizer.param_groups:\n    current_lr = param_group['lr']\n    print(f\"Current learning rate: {current_lr}\")\n```\n\nYou can place this code inside your training loop to print or log the learning rate at each iteration or epoch. This will help you track how the learning rate changes, especially if you're using learning rate scheduling techniques."
