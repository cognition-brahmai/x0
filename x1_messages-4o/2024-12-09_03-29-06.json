Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Open Settings**:\n   - Go to `File` -> `Settings` if you are on Windows/Linux.\n   - On macOS, it\u2019s `PyCharm` -> `Preferences`.\n\n2. **Navigate to Inspections**:\n   - In the left sidebar, expand the `Editor` section.\n   - Click on `Inspections`.\n\n3. **Search for Spelling**:\n   - In the search bar at the top of the Inspections window, type \"Spelling.\"\n   - You should see an option for `Spelling`.\n\n4. **Disable Spelling**:\n   - Uncheck the `Spelling` option to disable spell checking entirely.\n   - Alternatively, you can expand the `Spelling` option and uncheck sub-categories, such as `Typo`, if you want to customize which areas are checked.\n\n5. **Apply and OK**:\n   - Click `Apply` and then `OK` to save your changes.\n\nAfter doing this, PyCharm will stop highlighting misspelled words in your comments and strings, which should reduce the distraction caused by the jagged lines. If you later decide you want spell checking back, you can follow the same steps to enable it again."
