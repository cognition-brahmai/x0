Given two lists, 'a' and 'b', I want to create a new list that contains items that are only present in list 'a'. For example, if list 'a' contains the items 'apple', 'carrot', 'lemon' and list 'b' contains 'pineapple', 'apple', 'tomato', the new list should be 'carrot', 'lemon'. However, the code I've written keeps returning the entire list 'a'. How can I correct this?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired outcome, you can use list comprehension in Python to create a new list that includes only the items from list `a` that are not present in list `b`. This method is both simple and efficient for this kind of operation. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Define the initial lists\na = ['apple', 'carrot', 'lemon']\nb = ['pineapple', 'apple', 'tomato']\n\n# Use list comprehension to filter out items in 'a' that are also in 'b'\nresult = [item for item in a if item not in b]\n\n# Print the resulting list\nprint(result)\n```\n\nIn this code, the list comprehension `[item for item in a if item not in b]` iterates over each `item` in list `a` and includes it in the new list only if that `item` is not present in list `b`. This should give you the expected output:\n\n```\n['carrot', 'lemon']\n```\n\nMake sure that when you run this code, the lists `a` and `b` are defined correctly and the logic within the list comprehension is applied as shown. This should resolve the issue you encountered with your previous code."
