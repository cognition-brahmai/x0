        "content": "Creating a C# program to validate an email address involves checking if the email meets the standard format requirements. In C#, you can use regular expressions or the `MailAddress` class to validate an email address. Here\u2019s a simple example using both methods:\n\n### Method 1: Using Regular Expressions\n\nRegular expressions provide a flexible way to validate the email format. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Text.RegularExpressions;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Enter an email address to validate:\");\n        string email = Console.ReadLine();\n\n        if (IsValidEmail(email))\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"The email address is valid.\");\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"The email address is invalid.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    static bool IsValidEmail(string email)\n    {\n        string pattern = @\"^[^@\\s]+@[^@\\s]+\\.[^@\\s]+$\";\n        return Regex.IsMatch(email, pattern, RegexOptions.IgnoreCase);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Method 2: Using `MailAddress` Class\n\nThe `MailAddress` class in the `System.Net.Mail` namespace can also be used to validate the format of an email address.\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Net.Mail;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Enter an email address to validate:\");\n        string email = Console.ReadLine();\n\n        if (IsValidEmail(email))\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"The email address is valid.\");\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"The email address is invalid.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    static bool IsValidEmail(string email)\n    {\n        try\n        {\n            MailAddress mailAddress = new MailAddress(email);\n            return true;\n        }\n        catch (FormatException)\n        {\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Method 1 (Regex):** This uses a simple regular expression to check the email format. The pattern `^[^@\\s]+@[^@\\s]+\\.[^@\\s]+$` ensures that there is something before and after the '@' symbol and at least one '.' character in the domain part.\n\n- **Method 2 (MailAddress):** This method tries to create a `MailAddress` object with the provided string. If the string is not a valid email, it throws a `FormatException`, which is caught to return `false`.\n\nBoth methods can be effective, but using the `MailAddress` class is generally more straightforward and aligns with built-in .NET functionalities. Choose the method that best fits your needs or combine them for additional validation."
