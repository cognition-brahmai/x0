Using the given formula:\n\n\\[ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} |a_n - a| = 0 \\]\n\nThis indicates that for a sequence \\((a_n)\\), as \\(n\\) approaches infinity, the absolute difference between the sequence term \\(a_n\\) and the limit \\(a\\) approaches zero. In simpler terms, the terms of the sequence get arbitrarily close to the limit \\(a\\) as \\(n\\) becomes very large."
