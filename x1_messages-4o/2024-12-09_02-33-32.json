For this, I need to create an installable distribution that includes a wheel or egg for my project, a wheel or egg for every dependency of the project, and optionally, a requirements.txt file listing all the installable components for this release. Is there a simple plugin, similar to bdist_wheel, that can compile not just one wheel but also the project's components? While I can script this, I am looking for a shortcut that can build the package along with its dependencies in fewer steps. The solution should be compatible with Python 2.7 on both Windows and Linux platforms."

        "content": "To create an installable distribution that includes your project and all its dependencies, you can use a tool like `pip-compile` from the `pip-tools` package in combination with `setuptools` and `wheel`. While there isn't a direct plugin that compiles everything into wheels in one step, you can automate the process with a combination of these tools. Here's a step-by-step approach that should work for Python 2.7 on both Windows and Linux:\n\n1. **Install Necessary Tools:**\n\n   First, ensure you have `setuptools`, `wheel`, and `pip-tools` installed. You can install them using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install setuptools wheel pip-tools\n   ```\n\n2. **Prepare Your Project:**\n\n   Ensure your project has a `setup.py` file that correctly specifies all your dependencies under the `install_requires` parameter.\n\n3. **Generate a `requirements.txt`:**\n\n   Use `pip-compile` to generate a `requirements.txt` file that includes all your project's dependencies and their versions:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip-compile --output-file requirements.txt setup.py\n   ```\n\n4. **Build Wheels for Your Project and Its Dependencies:**\n\n   Use `pip wheel` to build wheels for your project and its dependencies:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip wheel --wheel-dir=dist -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n   This command will create wheels for all dependencies specified in `requirements.txt` and place them in the `dist` directory.\n\n5. **Build Your Project Wheel:**\n\n   Now, build a wheel for your project using `setup.py`:\n\n   ```bash\n   python setup.py bdist_wheel\n   ```\n\n   This command will create a wheel for your project and place it in the `dist` directory.\n\n6. **Combine Everything:**\n\n   At this point, your `dist` directory should contain wheels for your project and all its dependencies. You can distribute this directory as a package.\n\n7. **Optional - Create a Script for Easier Distribution:**\n\n   You can script these steps into a single bash or batch script, depending on your platform, to automate the process.\n\nThis approach leverages existing Python tools to automate as much of the process as possible, minimizing manual steps while ensuring compatibility with Python 2.7."
