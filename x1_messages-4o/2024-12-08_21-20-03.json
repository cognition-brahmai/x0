Furthermore, please ensure that the new sentence is structured differently from the original sentence to add an additional level of complexity. Additionally, explain how you chose the specific word \"wonderful\" and its relationship to the original sentence."

        "content": "Original Sentence: \"Life is full of surprises, and you never know what will happen next.\"\n\nNew Sentence: \"The wonderful unpredictability of life means that each moment unfolds with unexpected possibilities.\"\n\nExplanation: I chose the word \"wonderful\" to highlight the positive aspect of unpredictability, suggesting that the surprises life brings can be delightful and enriching. By using \"wonderful,\" the sentence embraces the uncertainty of life as a source of awe and joy, rather than purely as a source of unpredictability. This aligns with the original meaning but adds a positive spin, enhancing the idea that life's surprises can be wonderful experiences."
