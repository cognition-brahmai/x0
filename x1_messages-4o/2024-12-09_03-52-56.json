Is there a Python equivalent to the JavaScript Underscore.js (_.difference) library that can be used to accomplish this task?"

        "content": "To find the difference between two lists of dictionaries in Python, you can use a variety of approaches. One common method is to use list comprehensions combined with Python's built-in functionality. Since dictionaries are not hashable and can't be directly used in sets or as keys in dictionaries, you can convert them into a form that is hashable (like a tuple of tuples) to find the difference. Here's how you can accomplish this:\n\n```python\ndata1 = [{'name': u'String 1'}, {'name': u'String 2'}]\ndata2 = [{'name': u'String 1'}, {'name': u'String 2'}, {'name': u'String 3'}]\n\n# Convert the dictionaries to tuples so they can be used in sets\nset1 = set(tuple(sorted(d.items())) for d in data1)\nset2 = set(tuple(sorted(d.items())) for d in data2)\n\n# Find the difference\ndifference = set2 - set1\n\n# Convert the tuples back to dictionaries\ndifference = [dict(t) for t in difference]\n\nprint(difference)\n```\n\nThis will give you the difference between `data2` and `data1`, which in this case will be:\n\n```python\n[{'name': 'String 3'}]\n```\n\nThis method works by:\n\n1. Converting each dictionary to a tuple of tuples (sorted key-value pairs) to make them hashable.\n2. Creating sets from these tuples.\n3. Using set difference to find items that are in `data2` but not in `data1`.\n4. Converting the resulting tuples back into dictionaries.\n\nThis approach assumes that the order of the items within the dictionaries does not matter. If the dictionaries have more complex structures or if order matters, you would need to adjust the method accordingly."
