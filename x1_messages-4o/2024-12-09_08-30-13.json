For example, I want to select a slice of the dataframe where any of the columns are greater than 10. Additionally, I also want to select rows where the value for column 'colA' is greater than 10 but the value for 'colB' is less than 5. How can I implement this in pandas?"

        "content": "To achieve this in pandas, you can use boolean indexing to apply complex filters to your DataFrame. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Select rows where any of the columns are greater than 10:**\n\n   You can use the `any()` function along with a condition applied across the DataFrame to select rows where any column has a value greater than 10.\n\n2. **Select rows where 'colA' is greater than 10 and 'colB' is less than 5:**\n\n   You can apply a condition directly using boolean operators.\n\nHere's a code example to illustrate these steps:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'colA': [5, 11, 15, 2, 20],\n    'colB': [3, 9, 2, 8, 1],\n    'colC': [12, 7, 5, 11, 6]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Select rows where any column is greater than 10\nany_greater_than_10 = df[(df > 10).any(axis=1)]\n\n# Select rows where 'colA' > 10 and 'colB' < 5\ncolA_greater_10_colB_less_5 = df[(df['colA'] > 10) & (df['colB'] < 5)]\n\nprint(\"Rows where any column is greater than 10:\")\nprint(any_greater_than_10)\n\nprint(\"\\nRows where 'colA' > 10 and 'colB' < 5:\")\nprint(colA_greater_10_colB_less_5)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`(df > 10).any(axis=1)`**: This creates a boolean Series where each row is `True` if any column in that row has a value greater than 10. The `axis=1` parameter ensures the operation is performed row-wise.\n\n- **`(df['colA'] > 10) & (df['colB'] < 5)`**: This creates a boolean Series where each row is `True` if 'colA' is greater than 10 and 'colB' is less than 5.\n\nThese boolean Series are then used to index the DataFrame to select the desired rows."
