        "content": "Certainly! To generate a distinct name for a newly discovered star based on specific criteria such as location, brightness, and distance from other celestial objects, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Define the criteria for naming.\n2. Implement a method to check against existing names to avoid conflicts.\n3. Generate a unique name based on the criteria.\n4. Ensure the name does not conflict with existing names.\n\nHere is a simple Scala code example demonstrating how you might implement this:\n\n```scala\nimport scala.util.Random\n\nobject StarNamer {\n\n  // Sample table of existing star names (for demonstration purposes)\n  val existingNames = Set(\"Alpha Centauri\", \"Betelgeuse\", \"Sirius\")\n\n  // Function to generate a unique name for the star\n  def generateStarName(location: (Double, Double), brightness: Double, distance: Double): String = {\n    val baseName = s\"Star_${location._1}_${location._2}_${brightness}_${distance}\"\n    var uniqueName = baseName\n\n    // Check if the generated name is unique; if not, append a random number\n    while (existingNames.contains(uniqueName)) {\n      uniqueName = s\"${baseName}_${Random.nextInt(1000)}\"\n    }\n\n    uniqueName\n  }\n\n  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\n    // Example criteria\n    val location = (23.5, -45.0)  // Example coordinates\n    val brightness = 1.2          // Example brightness\n    val distance = 4.3            // Example distance in light-years\n\n    // Generate a unique name\n    val starName = generateStarName(location, brightness, distance)\n\n    // Output the generated star name\n    println(s\"Generated Star Name: $starName\")\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Existing Names Check**: We maintain a `Set` of existing star names to check for conflicts.\n2. **Name Generation**: The `generateStarName` function takes the location, brightness, and distance as parameters and generates a base name using these criteria.\n3. **Uniqueness**: If the generated name is already in the set of existing names, the code appends a random number to make it unique.\n4. **Output**: The `main` method demonstrates how to use this function with example inputs.\n\nThis code can be expanded and refined depending on the complexity and requirements of your naming criteria. For example, you might want to incorporate additional logic or attributes to derive the name or integrate more sophisticated algorithms for uniqueness checks."
