        "content": "Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) are a way of defining composite types in a programming language. They are commonly used in functional programming languages like Haskell or languages with functional features like Scala. Python, being an object-oriented language, doesn't have built-in support for ADTs in the same way, but you can simulate them using classes and other features.\n\nHere\u2019s how you might define algebraic data types in Python, particularly Python 3, using classes and the `dataclasses` module:\n\n### Using `dataclasses` in Python 3.7+\n\nPython 3.7 introduced the `dataclasses` module, which can be used to create classes that are primarily used to store data. It's a convenient way to define types that consist of multiple named fields.\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Union\n\n@dataclass\nclass Circle:\n    radius: float\n\n@dataclass\nclass Rectangle:\n    width: float\n    height: float\n\nShape = Union[Circle, Rectangle]\n\ndef area(shape: Shape) -> float:\n    if isinstance(shape, Circle):\n        return 3.14159 * shape.radius * shape.radius\n    elif isinstance(shape, Rectangle):\n        return shape.width * shape.height\n    else:\n        raise TypeError(\"Unsupported shape type\")\n\n# Example usage:\ncircle = Circle(radius=5)\nrectangle = Rectangle(width=4, height=6)\n\nprint(f\"Circle area: {area(circle)}\")\nprint(f\"Rectangle area: {area(rectangle)}\")\n```\n\n### Using Named Tuples in Python 2\n\nIn Python 2, you can use `namedtuple` from the `collections` module to create simple classes that essentially act as immutable, lightweight objects. It\u2019s not as powerful as `dataclasses`, but it works well for simple ADTs.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import namedtuple\n\nCircle = namedtuple('Circle', ['radius'])\nRectangle = namedtuple('Rectangle', ['width', 'height'])\n\ndef area(shape):\n    if isinstance(shape, Circle):\n        return 3.14159 * shape.radius * shape.radius\n    elif isinstance(shape, Rectangle):\n        return shape.width * shape.height\n    else:\n        raise TypeError(\"Unsupported shape type\")\n\n# Example usage:\ncircle = Circle(radius=5)\nrectangle = Rectangle(width=4, height=6)\n\nprint(f\"Circle area: {area(circle)}\")\nprint(f\"Rectangle area: {area(rectangle)}\")\n```\n\n### Using Classes\n\nFor more complex scenarios or when you need additional methods or properties, you can always use traditional classes to define your data types.\n\n```python\nclass Circle:\n    def __init__(self, radius):\n        self.radius = radius\n\nclass Rectangle:\n    def __init__(self, width, height):\n        self.width = width\n        self.height = height\n\ndef area(shape):\n    if isinstance(shape, Circle):\n        return 3.14159 * shape.radius * shape.radius\n    elif isinstance(shape, Rectangle):\n        return shape.width * shape.height\n    else:\n        raise TypeError(\"Unsupported shape type\")\n\n# Example usage:\ncircle = Circle(radius=5)\nrectangle = Rectangle(width=4, height=6)\n\nprint(f\"Circle area: {area(circle)}\")\nprint(f\"Rectangle area: {area(rectangle)}\")\n```\n\nThese examples illustrate how you can simulate ADTs in Python using classes and other constructs. The approach you choose depends on your specific needs and the version of Python you're using."
