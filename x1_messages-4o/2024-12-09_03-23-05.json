This library provides an easy way to access system information, including memory usage, and works across Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.\n\nFirst, you'll need to install the `psutil` library if you haven't already. You can do this using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install psutil\n```\n\nOnce you have `psutil` installed, you can use it to get memory information as follows:\n\n```python\nimport psutil\n\ndef get_memory_info():\n    # Get the memory details\n    memory_info = psutil.virtual_memory()\n\n    # Total physical memory\n    total_memory = memory_info.total\n\n    # Available memory\n    available_memory = memory_info.available\n\n    # Used memory\n    used_memory = memory_info.used\n\n    # Print or return the memory details\n    print(f\"Total Memory: {total_memory / (1024 ** 3):.2f} GB\")\n    print(f\"Available Memory: {available_memory / (1024 ** 3):.2f} GB\")\n    print(f\"Used Memory: {used_memory / (1024 ** 3):.2f} GB\")\n\n    return total_memory, available_memory, used_memory\n\n# Example usage\ntotal, available, used = get_memory_info()\n\n# You can add logic to check if there is sufficient memory for your operation\nrequired_memory = 2 * (1024 ** 3)  # e.g., 2 GB required\nif available >= required_memory:\n    print(\"Sufficient memory available to proceed.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Insufficient memory to proceed. Please free up some memory.\")\n\n```\n\nThis script will print the total, available, and used memory in gigabytes. You can then use these values to determine if there is enough free memory for your application's needs by comparing the available memory against your requirement. Adjust the `required_memory` variable as per your application's requirements."
