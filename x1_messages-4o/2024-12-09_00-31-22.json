The code I am using to merge is `new_df = df.merge(ranking_df, on=['club_name', 'year'], how='left')`. The \"how='left'\" part is added because I have fewer datapoints in my ranking_df than in my standard df. The expected output is a merged dataframe, but I am encountering a ValueError: \"You are trying to merge on object and int64 columns. If you wish to proceed you should use pd.concat\". However, I do not want to concatenate the dataframes, but rather merge them. The strange thing is that my code works if I first save the df dataframe to a .csv file and then load it back into a dataframe. I suspect that this could be due to the index_col=0 parameter, but I am unsure how to fix this issue without having to save the dataframe to a .csv file first, which is an inconvenience. How can I successfully merge these two dataframes without encountering this error?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering typically arises when the columns you're trying to merge on have different data types across the two dataframes. Specifically, one dataframe may have the column as an object (string) type, while the other has it as an integer (int64) type. This mismatch causes the merge operation to fail.\n\nTo resolve this issue without resorting to saving and reloading the dataframe, you can explicitly convert the data types of the columns you're merging on to ensure they match. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Check Data Types**: First, check the data types of the columns in both dataframes to see if there are any mismatches.\n\n   ```python\n   print(df.dtypes)\n   print(ranking_df.dtypes)\n   ```\n\n2. **Convert Data Types**: If you find that the data types are mismatched, convert them to the same type. For example, if `club_name` is an object in one dataframe and a string in another, or `year` is an int64 in one and object in another, you should standardize them.\n\n   ```python\n   df['club_name'] = df['club_name'].astype(str)\n   ranking_df['club_name'] = ranking_df['club_name'].astype(str)\n   \n   df['year'] = df['year'].astype(int)\n   ranking_df['year'] = ranking_df['year'].astype(int)\n   ```\n\n3. **Perform the Merge**: Now, try merging the dataframes again.\n\n   ```python\n   new_df = df.merge(ranking_df, on=['club_name', 'year'], how='left')\n   ```\n\nBy ensuring that the data types of the columns you are merging on are consistent across both dataframes, you should be able to perform the merge operation without any errors. If you encounter any additional issues, double-check all relevant columns for similar data type mismatches."
