Instead, you must provide a step-by-step guide on how to manually install all dependencies, configure the server, and deploy the application from the command line. Your guide should include specific versions of all necessary dependencies and should be easy to follow for someone with intermediate technical skills. Additionally, you must specify the Python version that is required for the deployment. Can you provide a clear and concise guide that achieves this task without the use of any GUI tools?"

        "content": "Certainly! Below is a step-by-step guide to deploy a Django web application on a Windows server using the command line, without any GUI tools. We'll use Python 3.8 as the required Python version for this deployment.\n\n### Step 1: Install Python\n\n1. **Download Python 3.8 Installer**:\n   - Open your command prompt and use `curl` to download the installer:\n     ```bash\n     curl -O https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.10/python-3.8.10-amd64.exe\n     ```\n\n2. **Install Python**:\n   - Run the downloaded installer via the command prompt:\n     ```bash\n     python-3.8.10-amd64.exe /quiet InstallAllUsers=1 PrependPath=1\n     ```\n\n3. **Verify Installation**:\n   - Check if Python is installed correctly:\n     ```bash\n     python --version\n     ```\n\n### Step 2: Install pip\n\n1. **Ensure pip is installed**:\n   - Pip should come with Python 3.8. Verify by:\n     ```bash\n     pip --version\n     ```\n\n2. **Upgrade pip** (if necessary):\n   - Ensure you have the latest version of pip:\n     ```bash\n     python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n     ```\n\n### Step 3: Install Virtualenv\n\n1. **Install Virtualenv**:\n   - Virtual environments help manage dependencies:\n     ```bash\n     pip install virtualenv\n     ```\n\n### Step 4: Set Up the Django Project\n\n1. **Navigate to your project directory**:\n   - Use the command prompt to go to the directory where you want to set up your Django project.\n\n2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:\n   - Inside your project directory:\n     ```bash\n     python -m virtualenv venv\n     ```\n\n3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:\n   - Activate it to isolate your project\u2019s dependencies:\n     ```bash\n     .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate\n     ```\n\n### Step 5: Install Django and Other Dependencies\n\n1. **Install Django**:\n   - Install the specific version your project requires (replace with your version if needed):\n     ```bash\n     pip install django==3.2.9\n     ```\n\n2. **Install Additional Dependencies**:\n   - Install any other dependencies listed in your `requirements.txt`:\n     ```bash\n     pip install -r requirements.txt\n     ```\n\n### Step 6: Configure the Database\n\n1. **Install and Configure the Database**:\n   - Ensure your database is set up and running. For SQLite (default Django setting), no setup is needed. For others like PostgreSQL, install the necessary adapter:\n     ```bash\n     pip install psycopg2-binary\n     ```\n\n2. **Configure Database Settings**:\n   - Edit your `settings.py` to configure the database settings according to your server setup.\n\n### Step 7: Collect Static Files\n\n1. **Collect Static Files**:\n   - Prepare your static files for deployment:\n     ```bash\n     python manage.py collectstatic\n     ```\n\n### Step 8: Run Migrations\n\n1. **Apply Migrations**:\n   - Apply any database migrations:\n     ```bash\n     python manage.py migrate\n     ```\n\n### Step 9: Configure the Web Server\n\n1. **Install a WSGI Server**:\n   - Use a WSGI server like Gunicorn or Waitress (for Windows, Waitress is recommended):\n     ```bash\n     pip install waitress\n     ```\n\n2. **Create a WSGI Entry Point**:\n   - Ensure your Django app has a `wsgi.py` file configured, typically found in your app directory.\n\n3. **Run the WSGI Server**:\n   - Start your server using Waitress:\n     ```bash\n     waitress-serve --port=8000 myproject.wsgi:application\n     ```\n\n### Step 10: Configure Windows Firewall\n\n1. **Allow Port Through Firewall**:\n   - Open the port (e.g., 8000) you are using so external requests can reach your server:\n     ```bash\n     netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=\"Open Port 8000\" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=8000\n     ```\n\n### Step 11: Test Your Deployment\n\n1. **Access the Application**:\n   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://your-server-ip:8000` to verify your application is running.\n\nThis guide provides a foundational setup for deploying a Django application on a Windows server using the command line. Adjust versions and configurations as necessary based on your project specifics and server environment."
