I'm currently creating a path object using the pathlib module as shown below:\n\n```python\np = pathlib.Path('file.txt')\n```\nThe object 'p' points to some file in the filesystem, as I'm able to execute commands like `p.read_text()`. I'm aware that I can use `os.path.abspath(p)` to obtain the absolute path, but I'm looking for a way to achieve this without resorting to the `os.path` method, considering that `pathlib` should ideally replace `os.path`."

        "content": "To get the absolute path of a `pathlib.Path` object in Python, you can use the `.resolve()` method provided by the `pathlib` module itself. This method returns a new `Path` object representing the absolute path. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\np = Path('file.txt')\nabsolute_path = p.resolve()\n\nprint(absolute_path)\n```\n\nThe `resolve()` method will compute the absolute path by resolving any symbolic links and references like `..` or `.` in the path. This is the recommended way to get the absolute path using the `pathlib` module."
