However, when I try to download some Python versions using `pyenv install 2.7.11`, I get an error message. Here is the error message:\n```\nDownloading Python-2.7.11.tgz...\n-> https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.11/Python-2.7.11.tgz\nerror: failed to download Python-2.7.11.tar.gz\n\nBUILD FAILED (Ubuntu 15.04 using python-build 20160509)\n```\nI've looked at the official Common build problems on the pyenv GitHub page, but I haven't found any similar issues. Could this problem be due to pyenv not catching the new Ubuntu update?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering could be due to several reasons, ranging from network issues to missing dependencies required for building Python from source. Here are several steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Network and URL Accessibility:**\n   - Ensure that your internet connection is stable.\n   - Try accessing `https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.11/Python-2.7.11.tgz` directly in a web browser or using `wget` or `curl` to make sure the URL is accessible from your network.\n\n2. **Update pyenv and Python-Build:**\n   - Make sure you have the latest version of `pyenv` and the associated `python-build` plugin. You can update both by navigating to the `.pyenv` directory and pulling the latest changes from the respective repositories:\n     ```bash\n     cd ~/.pyenv\n     git pull\n     cd plugins/python-build\n     git pull\n     ```\n\n3. **Install Required Dependencies:**\n   - Python builds often require several system packages. Install the required dependencies for building Python:\n     ```bash\n     sudo apt-get update\n     sudo apt-get install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev \\\n     libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm \\\n     libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev\n     ```\n\n4. **Check for Conflicting Tools:**\n   - Ensure that there are no conflicting installations or versions of tools like `wget`, `curl`, or any other network-related utilities.\n\n5. **Adjust SSL/TLS Settings:**\n   - In some cases, SSL/TLS mismatches can cause download failures. You can try setting the `PYTHON_BUILD_ARIA2_OPTS` environment variable to use an alternative download method:\n     ```bash\n     export PYTHON_BUILD_ARIA2_OPTS=\"-x 10 -k 1M\"\n     pyenv install 2.7.11\n     ```\n\n6. **Use an Alternative Mirror:**\n   - If the Python.org server is unreachable, you can try using a different mirror. However, this requires modifying the pyenv script or manually downloading the file and placing it in the appropriate directory.\n\n7. **Manual Download and Install:**\n   - As a last resort, you can manually download the mentioned tarball (`Python-2.7.11.tgz`) and place it in the pyenv cache directory:\n     ```bash\n     wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.11/Python-2.7.11.tgz\n     mkdir -p ~/.pyenv/cache\n     mv Python-2.7.11.tgz ~/.pyenv/cache/\n     pyenv install 2.7.11\n     ```\n\nIf none of these solutions work, consider checking the pyenv GitHub issues page or forums for any specific issues related to your Ubuntu version or any recent updates."
