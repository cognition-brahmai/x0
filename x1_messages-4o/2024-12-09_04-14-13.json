My dictionary contains keys as strings and values as lists of strings, all in Unicode. When I try to print most of the keys and values using str() method, I get the above error for some values that have the Unicode character \\u2013. I suspect this issue is arising because of Unicode embedded in Unicode that the Python interpreter is unable to decode. How can I resolve this error?"

        "content": "The `UnicodeEncodeError` you're encountering typically arises when you're attempting to encode Unicode data into a format that doesn't support certain characters, such as ASCII. In your case, the character `\\u2013` is an en dash, which is not representable in ASCII encoding. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Use Proper Encoding**: When dealing with Unicode strings, it's important to encode them into a suitable character set that can handle all the characters, such as UTF-8.\n\n2. **Print Using UTF-8 Encoding**: Ensure you are printing the Unicode strings using UTF-8 encoding. You can do this by explicitly encoding your strings. Here's how you can modify your code to handle the encoding:\n\n   ```python\n   for key, value_list in your_dictionary.items():\n       key_encoded = key.encode('utf-8')\n       value_list_encoded = [value.encode('utf-8') for value in value_list]\n       print(key_encoded)\n       for value in value_list_encoded:\n           print(value)\n   ```\n\n3. **Set Default Encoding**: If you are using Python 2, consider setting the default encoding to UTF-8 at the start of your script. However, note that this is generally not recommended as a permanent solution but can work for quick scripts:\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   reload(sys)\n   sys.setdefaultencoding('utf-8')\n   ```\n\n   In Python 3, strings are Unicode by default, so you should not encounter this issue unless you're explicitly encoding them to ASCII.\n\n4. **Use Unicode literals (Python 2)**: If you're using Python 2, make sure to use Unicode literals for your strings by prefixing them with `u`, like `u'string'`.\n\n5. **Check Data Sources**: Ensure that the data sources (like the XSL file) are read correctly with the right encoding. If you have control over how the file is read, specify the encoding:\n\n   ```python\n   import xlrd\n\n   workbook = xlrd.open_workbook('your_file.xls', encoding_override='utf-8')\n   ```\n\n6. **Python 3 Transition**: If you're still using Python 2, consider transitioning to Python 3, where strings are Unicode by default, making handling of Unicode much more straightforward.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `UnicodeEncodeError` and print your dictionary contents without issues."
