        "content": "I am self-learning machine learning and have a question regarding gradient descent. The formula for gradient descent is given by the following logistics regression:\n\n<pre><code>Repeat {\n    \u03b8j = \u03b8j\u2212\u03b1/m\u2211(h\u03b8(x)\u2212y)xj\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nWhere \u03b8j is the coefficient on variable j; \u03b1 is the learning rate; h\u03b8(x) is the hypothesis; y is the real value and xj is the value of the variable j. m is the number of training sets. h\u03b8(x), y are for each training set (i.e. that's what the summation sign is for). I am confused about whether the summation is representing my entire training set or how many iterations I have done up to that point. For instance, if I have 10 training examples and perform gradient descent after each training example, my coefficients will be quite different compared to if I performed gradient descent after all 10 training examples. I have illustrated two different ways of performing gradient descent below. Which method is correct? \n\nThe cost function and hypothesis function are:\n\n<pre><code>cost function = \u22121/m\u2211[ylog(h\u03b8(x))+(1\u2212y)log(1\u2212h\u03b8(x))]\nh\u03b8(x) = 1/(1+ e^-z) \nand z= \u03b8o + \u03b81X1+\u03b82X2 +\u03b83X3...\u03b8nXn\n</code></pre>"

        "content": "Your confusion is quite common when learning gradient descent, especially in the context of logistic regression. Let's clarify the two methods you're referring to: batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent (SGD).\n\n### Batch Gradient Descent\n\nIn **batch gradient descent**, you update the parameters \\(\\theta_j\\) after computing the gradient of the cost function over the entire training dataset. This means you calculate the summation over all your training examples in one go before updating the parameters. The update rule becomes:\n\n\\[ \n\\theta_j = \\theta_j - \\alpha \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left( h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \\right) x_j^{(i)}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(m\\) is the total number of training examples, and you perform this update once per epoch (a complete pass over the entire dataset).\n\n### Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)\n\nIn **stochastic gradient descent**, you update the parameters \\(\\theta_j\\) for each training example individually. This means after calculating the gradient for a single training example, you immediately update \\(\\theta_j\\). The update rule becomes:\n\n\\[ \n\\theta_j = \\theta_j - \\alpha \\left( h_\\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)} \\right) x_j^{(i)}\n\\]\n\nHere, you update \\(\\theta_j\\) for each \\(i\\) before moving to the next training example.\n\n### Which Method is Correct?\n\nBoth methods are correct, but they have different characteristics:\n\n- **Batch Gradient Descent**: Generally converges to the minimum more smoothly because it uses the whole dataset for each update, but it can be computationally expensive for large datasets.\n  \n- **Stochastic Gradient Descent**: Faster per iteration since it uses only one sample to compute the gradient, which can make it more suitable for large datasets. However, its path to the minimum can be noisier.\n\nThere's also a middle ground called **Mini-batch Gradient Descent**, where you update the parameters using a small batch of examples rather than the entire dataset or a single example. This approach often benefits from both worlds: it reduces the variance of the parameter updates (like batch) and allows for faster convergence (like SGD).\n\nUltimately, the choice between these methods depends on your specific use case, such as the size of your dataset and the computational resources available."
