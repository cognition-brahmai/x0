        "content": "Is there a standard method in Python for exception chaining similar to the 'caused by' method in Java? I have a module with a main exception class 'DSError' and a try block which might throw other exceptions. I want only 'DSError' to be thrown and to include information about what happened and why. Here is the current code:\n\n```python\nclass DSError(Exception):\n    pass\n\ntry:\n    v = my_dict[k]\n    something(v)\nexcept KeyError as e:\n    raise DSError(\"no key %s found for %s\" % (k, self))\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    raise DSError(\"Bad Value %s found for %s\" % (v, self))\nexcept DSError as e:\n    raise DSError(\"%s raised in %s\" % (e, self))\n```\n\nI would prefer if I could use exception chaining like this:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    v = my_dict[k]\n    something(v)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    raise DSError(self, v, e)  # Exception chained...\n```\n\nIs this the standard Pythonic way? I haven't seen exception chains used in other modules, so how is it done in Python?"

        "content": "Yes, Python does provide a standard way to handle exception chaining, which is similar to the \"caused by\" feature in Java. This is done using the `from` keyword when raising exceptions. This keyword allows you to explicitly chain exceptions, and it's the recommended Pythonic way to handle such scenarios.\n\nHere's how you can implement exception chaining in your code:\n\n```python\nclass DSError(Exception):\n    def __init__(self, message, *args):\n        super().__init__(message)\n        self.args = args\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"{self.args[0]}\"\n\ntry:\n    v = my_dict[k]\n    something(v)\nexcept KeyError as e:\n    raise DSError(\"No key %s found for %s\" % (k, self)) from e\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    raise DSError(\"Bad value %s found for %s\" % (v, self)) from e\nexcept DSError as e:\n    raise DSError(\"%s raised in %s\" % (e, self)) from e\n```\n\nBy using the `from` keyword, you effectively chain the original exception to the new one, preserving the original traceback and providing context about the cause of the exception. This allows you to raise a custom exception (`DSError` in this case) while still retaining information about the original exception that caused the error. When printed, Python will display the exception traceback, showing both the `DSError` and the original exception that caused it.\n\nThis is a clean and effective way to handle exceptions, as it ensures that the context of the original error is not lost, which can be very helpful for debugging and logging purposes."
