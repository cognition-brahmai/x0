Below is a sample code that demonstrates how to translate the English word \"friend\" to Spanish using this gem.\n\nFirst, you need to install the gem by adding it to your `Gemfile`:\n\n```ruby\ngem 'google-cloud-translate', '~> 2.0'\n```\n\nThen run `bundle install` to install the gem.\n\nNext, you'll need to set up your Google Cloud credentials. You should have a service account JSON key file, which you can set up by following these steps:\n\n1. Go to the Google Cloud Console.\n2. Create a new project or select an existing project.\n3. Enable the Cloud Translation API for your project.\n4. Create a service account key with the role \"Project > Editor\" or \"Cloud Translation API > Admin\".\n5. Download the JSON key file.\n\nSet the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of the JSON file:\n\n```bash\nexport GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=\"path/to/your/service-account-file.json\"\n```\n\nNow, you can use the following Ruby code to translate the word \"friend\" to Spanish:\n\n```ruby\nrequire \"google/cloud/translate\"\n\n# Initialize the Translation client\ntranslate = Google::Cloud::Translate.translation_v2_service\n\n# Define the text to be translated and the target language\ntext = \"friend\"\ntarget_language = \"es\" # Spanish language code\n\n# Translate the text\ntranslation = translate.translate text, to: target_language\n\n# Output the translated text\nputs \"The Spanish translation of 'friend' is: #{translation.text}\"\n```\n\nThis code initializes the Google Translate client, specifies the text to be translated, and sets the target language to Spanish. It then performs the translation and prints the result.\n\nMake sure your Google Cloud project has billing enabled, as the Translation API is a paid service."
