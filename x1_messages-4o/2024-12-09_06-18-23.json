Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Original dictionary\noriginal_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n\n# Key to be removed\nkey_to_remove = 'b'\n\n# Create a copy of the original dictionary\nnew_dict = original_dict.copy()\n\n# Remove the item with the specified key from the new dictionary\nif key_to_remove in new_dict:\n    del new_dict[key_to_remove]\n\n# Output the new dictionary\nprint(\"Original dictionary:\", original_dict)\nprint(\"New dictionary without the key:\", new_dict)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1. We start with an `original_dict`.\n2. We identify the `key_to_remove`.\n3. We create a shallow copy of the original dictionary using the `copy()` method.\n4. We then check if the key exists in the new dictionary and remove it using the `del` statement.\n5. Finally, we print both the original and the new dictionary to see the result."
