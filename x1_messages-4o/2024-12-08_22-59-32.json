By observing the embeddings:\n\n- \"Stir\" has an embedding of 0.2\n- \"Pressure\" has an embedding of 0.8\n- \"Jump\" has an embedding of 0.4\n\nFrom a numerical standpoint, \"Pressure\" stands out as it has a significantly different embedding (0.8) compared to the others, which are relatively closer in value (0.2 and 0.4). Therefore, based on the embeddings provided, \"Pressure\" is the word that stands out as different from the others."
