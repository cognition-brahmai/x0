Although I can use 'exit()' to exit python, I would like to know if there is a shortcut to fully exit (not just stop) python in terminal and why 'ctrl-c' does not work? Also, how can I kill all the stopped python processes? Additionally, how can I type 'ctrl-c' and other hotkeys with a keyboard?"

        "content": "When using Python in the terminal on a Mac, certain keyboard shortcuts behave differently due to how signals are handled by the terminal and the operating system. Here's a breakdown of your questions:\n\n### Exiting Python in Terminal:\n1. **Ctrl-Z**: This shortcut sends a `SIGTSTP` signal, which suspends the Python process and sends it to the background but does not terminate it. This is why you see multiple stopped Python processes.\n\n2. **Ctrl-C**: This shortcut sends a `SIGINT` signal, which is designed to interrupt a running process. In the Python interpreter, it usually raises a `KeyboardInterrupt` exception, which can be caught by your code, allowing you to handle the interruption. If nothing catches the exception, it should terminate the current command or script execution, but it will not exit the interpreter.\n\n3. **Shortcut to Exit Python**:\n   - **Ctrl-D**: This is the shortcut to send an EOF (End Of File) signal to the Python interpreter, which will exit the interpreter. It's equivalent to typing `exit()` or `quit()`.\n\n### Killing Stopped Python Processes:\nTo kill all the stopped Python processes, you can use the following commands in the terminal:\n\n1. **List Stopped Processes**:\n   - Use the `jobs` command to list all jobs in the current terminal session. You'll see jobs with a `Stopped` status.\n\n2. **Kill Stopped Processes**:\n   - Use the `kill` command with the job number or process ID. For example, to kill a specific job:\n     ```bash\n     kill %1  # where 1 is the job number shown by the `jobs` command\n     ```\n\n   - To kill all stopped Python processes, you can use:\n     ```bash\n     killall -9 python\n     ```\n     Be careful with this command as it will forcefully terminate all running Python processes.\n\n### Using Ctrl-C and Other Hotkeys:\n- **Ctrl-C**: Press the `Control` key and the `C` key simultaneously. This should send the interrupt signal to the current process.\n- **Other Hotkeys**: Hotkeys are combinations of the `Control`, `Option`, `Command`, and other keys. The exact behavior can vary depending on your terminal emulator and shell configuration.\n\nIf you're using a terminal emulator like iTerm2 or Terminal.app, ensure that your preferences and key mappings are set correctly to handle these shortcuts as expected. Additionally, check that no custom shell scripts or configurations are interfering with default signal handling."
