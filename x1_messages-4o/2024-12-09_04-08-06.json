For example, when I call `partition([1,2,3,4,5],5)` it should return `[[1],[2],[3],[4],[5]]`, when I call `partition([1,2,3,4,5],2)` it should return `[[1,2],[3,4,5]]` or `[[1,2,3],[4,5]]` and when I call `partition([1,2,3,4,5],3)` it should return `[[1,2],[3,4],[5]]`. I've found several solutions that are focused on the size of the list, but what I'm really interested in is the number of the lists. Similarly, while there are a lot of solutions for splitting a list into evenly sized chunks, I'm more interested in the number of partitions than the specific size, as long as it's within 1. What is the best practice to achieve this?"

        "content": "To partition a list into `n` nearly-equal partitions, you can use a function that calculates the size of each partition and distributes the elements accordingly. Here's a sample implementation in Python:\n\n```python\ndef partition(lst, n):\n    # Calculate the size of each partition\n    avg_size = len(lst) // n\n    remainder = len(lst) % n\n\n    # Initialize the list of partitions\n    partitions = []\n    start = 0\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Calculate the end index for the current partition\n        end = start + avg_size + (1 if i < remainder else 0)\n        # Append the partition to the list\n        partitions.append(lst[start:end])\n        # Update the start index for the next partition\n        start = end\n\n    return partitions\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(partition([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 5))  # Output: [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]\nprint(partition([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2))  # Output: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]\nprint(partition([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3))  # Output: [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Calculate Average Size and Remainder**: \n   - `avg_size` is the integer division of the length of the list by `n`, which gives the base size of each partition.\n   - `remainder` is the remainder of the division, which indicates how many partitions need to be larger by one element.\n\n2. **Distribute Elements**:\n   - Iterate `n` times to create each partition.\n   - For the first `remainder` partitions, add one more element to the base size (`avg_size + 1`).\n   - For the rest, use the base size (`avg_size`).\n\n3. **Build Partitions**:\n   - Use slicing to create the partition from `start` to `end`.\n   - Update `start` to the `end` for the next iteration.\n\nThis method ensures that the partitions are as evenly distributed as possible, with the first few partitions potentially having one more element than the others if the list cannot be divided perfectly evenly."
