Here\u2019s a simple guide on how to make a delicious egg white omelette:\n\n### Ingredients:\n- 4 large egg whites\n- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste\n- Cooking spray or 1 teaspoon of olive oil\n- 1/4 cup spinach, chopped\n- 1/4 cup tomatoes, diced\n- 1/4 cup mushrooms, sliced\n- 2 tablespoons onion, finely chopped\n- 2 tablespoons bell pepper, finely chopped\n- 2 tablespoons feta cheese (optional)\n- Fresh herbs like parsley or chives (optional)\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Preparation:**\n   - Separate the egg whites from the yolks. You can save the yolks for another dish.\n   - Whisk the egg whites in a bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper until slightly frothy.\n\n2. **Preheat the Pan:**\n   - Use a non-stick skillet and preheat it over medium-low heat. The ideal cooking temperature is around 275\u00b0F to 300\u00b0F (135\u00b0C to 149\u00b0C).\n   - Add a small amount of cooking spray or olive oil to the pan to prevent sticking.\n\n3. **Saut\u00e9 the Vegetables:**\n   - Add onions to the skillet and saut\u00e9 for about 1-2 minutes until they start to soften.\n   - Add mushrooms, bell peppers, and tomatoes. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until the vegetables are tender.\n   - Add spinach last and cook until just wilted, about 30 seconds.\n   - Remove the saut\u00e9ed vegetables from the pan and set aside.\n\n4. **Cooking the Egg Whites:**\n   - Pour the egg whites into the same skillet, making sure they spread evenly across the surface.\n   - Allow the egg whites to cook undisturbed for about 2-3 minutes or until the edges start to set.\n\n5. **Assembling the Omelette:**\n   - Once the egg whites are mostly set but still slightly runny on top, evenly distribute the saut\u00e9ed vegetables and feta cheese (if using) over one half of the omelette.\n   - Use a spatula to carefully fold the omelette in half over the filling.\n\n6. **Finishing Touches:**\n   - Continue cooking for another 1-2 minutes until the egg whites are completely set and the cheese is slightly melted.\n   - Slide the omelette onto a plate and garnish with fresh herbs, if desired.\n\n### Tips:\n- Keep the heat low to avoid browning the egg whites too quickly, which can make them rubbery.\n- Be gentle when folding the omelette to prevent tearing.\n- Feel free to customize with other fillings like lean ham, turkey, or different types of cheese.\n\nBy following these steps and adjusting to your taste, you'll achieve a delicious and healthy egg white omelette. Enjoy your meal!"
