Here's my current function:\n\n```python\nfrom openpyxl.writer.excel import ExcelWriter\n\ndef save_xls(list_dfs, xls_path):\n    writer = ExcelWriter(xls_path)\n    for n, df in enumerate(list_dfs):\n        df.to_excel(writer,'sheet%s' % n)\n    writer.save()\n```\n\nHowever, when I try to run this, I encounter an AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'worksheets'. I believe I might not be correctly calling 'ExcelWriter'. How should I modify my function to correctly export my list of DataFrames into one Excel spreadsheet?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is likely due to the incorrect usage of the `ExcelWriter` class. In recent versions of `pandas`, the `ExcelWriter` class is used differently. Let's correct your function using `pandas.ExcelWriter` instead of `openpyxl.writer.excel.ExcelWriter`. Here's how you can modify your function to save a list of DataFrames into one Excel spreadsheet:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef save_xls(list_dfs, xls_path):\n    with pd.ExcelWriter(xls_path, engine='openpyxl') as writer:\n        for n, df in enumerate(list_dfs):\n            df.to_excel(writer, sheet_name=f'sheet{n}')\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Use `pandas.ExcelWriter`:** The recommended way to write multiple DataFrames to an Excel file is to use `pandas.ExcelWriter`.\n\n2. **Context Manager:** It's good practice to use a context manager (`with` statement), which ensures that the writer is properly closed after writing, even if an error occurs.\n\n3. **Sheet Naming:** When naming sheets, use `sheet_name` parameter inside `to_excel` to specify the sheet name.\n\n4. **Engine Specification:** Although `pandas` can usually infer the engine based on the file extension, specifying `engine='openpyxl'` explicitly can help avoid issues.\n\nThis function will create an Excel file with each DataFrame in a separate sheet named `sheet0`, `sheet1`, etc. Adjust the sheet naming logic as needed for your application."
