You've been able to collect data on the number of Froubles and Bimbles that are present at different times of the day, but there's a twist - the ratio of Froubles to Bimbles changes throughout the day. \nUsing the following clues, determine the ratio of Froubles to Bimbles during two different times of the day: morning and evening. \n1. In the morning, the ratio of Froubles to Bimbles is 4:5.\n2. In the evening, the ratio of Bimbles to Froubles is 3:2. \n3. The total number of Froubles and Bimbles is 180. \nWhat is the ratio of Froubles to Bimbles during morning and evening on planet Y-28?"

The ratio of Froubles to Bimbles in the morning is 4:5.\n2. Let \\( x \\) be the common factor such that:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of Froubles (morning)} = 4x\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of Bimbles (morning)} = 5x\n   \\]\n3. The total number of creatures:\n   \\[\n   4x + 5x = 9x\n   \\]\n\n### Evening\n1. The ratio of Bimbles to Froubles in the evening is 3:2.\n2. Let \\( y \\) be the common factor such that:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of Bimbles (evening)} = 3y\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of Froubles (evening)} = 2y\n   \\]\n3. The total number of creatures:\n   \\[\n   3y + 2y = 5y\n   \\]\n\n### Equating the Total Population\nSince the total number of creatures remains constant at 180, we equate both expressions to 180:\n\nFor morning:\n\\[\n9x = 180 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = 20\n\\]\n\nFor evening:\n\\[\n5y = 180 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y = 36\n\\]\n\n### Calculating Specific Numbers\n**Morning:**\n- Number of Froubles = \\( 4x = 4 \\times 20 = 80 \\)\n- Number of Bimbles = \\( 5x = 5 \\times 20 = 100 \\)\n- Ratio of Froubles to Bimbles = \\( \\frac{80}{100} = \\frac{4}{5} \\)\n\n**Evening:**\n- Number of Bimbles = \\( 3y = 3 \\times 36 = 108 \\)\n- Number of Froubles = \\( 2y = 2 \\times 36 = 72 \\)\n- Ratio of Froubles to Bimbles = \\( \\frac{72}{108} = \\frac{2}{3} \\)\n\n### Conclusion\n- The ratio of Froubles to Bimbles in the morning is 4:5.\n- The ratio of Froubles to Bimbles in the evening is 2:3."
