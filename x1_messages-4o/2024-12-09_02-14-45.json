        "content": "To time a piece of code in Python, you can use the `time` module, which provides various time-related functions. However, if you specifically want to measure the execution time in terms of seconds (similar to your pseudocode), you can use `time.time()` or `time.perf_counter()` for higher precision. `time.time()` returns the current time in seconds since the epoch, while `time.perf_counter()` provides a higher-resolution timer, which is more suitable for measuring short durations.\n\nHere's how you can achieve what you're trying to do:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\n# Start timing\nstart = time.time()\n\n# Your long-running code\ndo_long_code()\n\n# End timing\nend = time.time()\n\n# Calculate the duration\nduration = end - start\n\nprint(f\"It took {duration} seconds.\")\n```\n\nIf you need higher precision, you can switch to `time.perf_counter()`:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\n# Start timing\nstart = time.perf_counter()\n\n# Your long-running code\ndo_long_code()\n\n# End timing\nend = time.perf_counter()\n\n# Calculate the duration\nduration = end - start\n\nprint(f\"It took {duration} seconds.\")\n```\n\nNote that `time.perf_counter()` is recommended for benchmarking code execution time because it has better precision and is not affected by system clock updates."
