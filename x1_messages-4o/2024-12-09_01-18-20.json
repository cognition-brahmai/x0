        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this by using the `enumerate` function in Python, which not only allows you to iterate over the elements of a list but also provides an automatic counter that you can use as an index. Here's how you can modify your code to include an index and pass it to the `g.output()` method:\n\n```python\nfor index, g in enumerate(games[0:4], start=1):  # start=1 for 1-based index\n    g.output(index)\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, `enumerate(games[0:4], start=1)` will iterate over the first four elements of the `games` list and provide an index starting at 1. The `index` variable will then be passed to the `g.output()` method, allowing you to achieve the desired output format like `Game 2 - ... stuff relating to the object 'g' here`. Adjust the `start` parameter if you prefer a different starting index."
