I tried with the code below, but it didn't work as expected. \n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\nim = Image.open('A:\\ex1.jpg')\nfor pixel in im.getdata():\n    if pixel == (255,0,0):\n        print \"Red coloured pixel\"\n    else:\n        pixel = [0, 0, 0]\n```"

        "content": "To change the color value of every pixel in an image to black (0, 0, 0), except for those that are red (255, 0, 0), you need to modify the pixel data and then save the image. The code you provided doesn't modify the image because it only changes the local `pixel` variable and doesn't update the image itself.\n\nHere's how you can achieve your goal using the Python Imaging Library (PIL):\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\n\n# Open the image\nim = Image.open('A:/ex1.jpg')\n\n# Ensure the image is in RGB mode\nim = im.convert('RGB')\n\n# Load the pixel data\npixels = im.load()\n\n# Get the dimensions of the image\nwidth, height = im.size\n\n# Iterate over each pixel in the image\nfor y in range(height):\n    for x in range(width):\n        # Get the current pixel value\n        current_pixel = pixels[x, y]\n\n        # Check if the pixel is red\n        if current_pixel == (255, 0, 0):\n            # Leave the pixel as it is\n            continue\n        else:\n            # Change the pixel to black\n            pixels[x, y] = (0, 0, 0)\n\n# Save the modified image\nim.save('A:/modified_ex1.jpg')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Convert to RGB**: Ensure the image is in RGB mode by converting it if necessary.\n- **Load and Access Pixels**: Use `im.load()` to access the pixel data.\n- **Iterate and Modify**: Iterate over each pixel and check if it's red. If it's not red, change it to black.\n- **Save the Image**: Save the modified image to a new file. \n\nMake sure the file paths are correct for your system, and adjust them if necessary. This script will create a new file named `modified_ex1.jpg` with the desired modifications."
