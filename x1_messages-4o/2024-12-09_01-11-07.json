        "content": "Yes, you can use the `docutils` library in Python to parse reStructuredText (reST) into a document tree model. `docutils` is the underlying library that powers `Sphinx`, and it provides tools to parse reStructuredText documents and transform them into a document tree, which can then be processed or transformed into other formats.\n\nHere's a basic example of how you can use `docutils` to parse reStructuredText into a document tree:\n\n```python\nfrom docutils.core import publish_doctree\n\n# Sample reStructuredText content\nrst_content = \"\"\"\nTitle\n=====\n\nSubtitle\n--------\n\nThis is a paragraph in reStructuredText.\n\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n- Item 3\n\n.. note::\n\n   This is a note.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Parse the reStructuredText into a document tree\ndocument_tree = publish_doctree(rst_content)\n\n# Print the document tree\nprint(document_tree)\n```\n\nIn this example, `publish_doctree` is used to parse the reStructuredText content into a document tree. The resulting `document_tree` is an abstract syntax tree representing the structure of the document.\n\n`Sphinx` builds on top of `docutils` and provides additional functionality for generating documentation, but if your goal is solely to parse reStructuredText into a tree model, `docutils` is the appropriate tool to use. If you need more advanced features like cross-references, indexing, or output in various formats, `Sphinx` might be a better option to consider."
