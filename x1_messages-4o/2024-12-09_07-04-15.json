I noticed an unexpected behavior when I first slice a row and then a column, it appears to create a view. However, if I first slice a column and then a row, it seems to create a copy. Here are the code snippets I used:\n\nFirst scenario:\n```\n>>> a = np.arange(12).reshape(3, 4)   \n>>> a[0:3:2, :][:, [0, 2]] = 100\n>>> a\narray([[100,   1, 100,   3],\n       [  4,   5,   6,   7],\n       [100,   9, 100,  11]])\n```\n\nSecond scenario:\n```\n>>> a[:, [0, 2]][0:3:2, :] = 0\n>>> a\narray([[100,   1, 100,   3],\n       [  4,   5,   6,   7],\n       [100,   9, 100,  11]])\n```\n\nIt appears both methods result in the same position change, but why doesn't the second method actually change the number?"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is related to how NumPy handles slicing and indexing, particularly the difference between views and copies.\n\nIn NumPy, slicing an array generally creates a view, meaning it doesn't actually make a copy of the data; it just creates a new array object that references the same data. However, when you use fancy indexing (like using a list or an array as an index), NumPy creates a copy of the data.\n\nLet's break down the two scenarios:\n\n1. **First Scenario: `a[0:3:2, :][:, [0, 2]] = 100`**\n\n   - `a[0:3:2, :]` slices the array to select every second row from index 0 to 3. This operation returns a view of the original array.\n   - Then `[:, [0, 2]]` uses fancy indexing to select columns 0 and 2, which results in a copy of the data in those columns.\n   - The assignment `= 100` modifies this copy, but because the first operation was a view, the changes reflect back on the original array.\n\n2. **Second Scenario: `a[:, [0, 2]][0:3:2, :] = 0`**\n\n   - `a[:, [0, 2]]` uses fancy indexing to select columns 0 and 2, creating a copy of these columns.\n   - `[0:3:2, :]` then slices this copy to select rows. However, since the data is already a copy from the previous step, modifications on this slice do not affect the original array `a`.\n\nIn summary, the key difference is the order of operations and the use of fancy indexing. Fancy indexing results in a copy, so any modifications after fancy indexing do not affect the original array. In the first scenario, the slice operation happens before the fancy indexing, allowing the changes to affect the original array, while in the second scenario, the fancy indexing happens first, resulting in a copy that is not linked to the original array."
