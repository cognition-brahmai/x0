        "content": "The `librosa.griffinlim` function, which performs the Griffin-Lim algorithm, is inherently an iterative process for recovering phase information lost in the magnitude spectrogram. This process can introduce artifacts or distortion, especially when the number of iterations is not sufficient or the windowing parameters aren't optimal. Here are some strategies to reduce distortion:\n\n1. **Increase the Number of Iterations:**\n   - You already have a high number of iterations (`n_iter=1024`), which is good. However, ensure that this is indeed the best trade-off for your application, as increasing iterations can help but also increase computation time.\n\n2. **Use a Different Window Function:**\n   - Experiment with different window functions. While the Hamming window is commonly used, you may find that a Hann window (`scipy.signal.windows.hann`) or another type provides better results for your specific signal.\n\n3. **Adjust Window and Hop Length:**\n   - Ensure that your `hop_length` and `win_length` are optimal for your signal. A typical setting is `hop_length = win_length // 4`. Adjusting these parameters can help reduce artifacts.\n\n4. **Normalize the Spectrogram:**\n   - Normalize the magnitude spectrogram before passing it to `griffinlim`. This can sometimes help in reducing distortion.\n\n5. **Post-Processing:**\n   - Consider applying a simple denoising filter to the output signal. Techniques such as spectral gating or low-pass filtering might help in reducing artifacts.\n\n6. **Use an Overlap-Add Method:**\n   - Ensure that the overlap-add method used in reconstruction is correctly aligned. Misalignment can lead to noticeable artifacts.\n\n7. **Alternative Algorithms:**\n   - If distortion remains a problem and computational resources are available, consider exploring alternative phase reconstruction algorithms or models that might provide better results than Griffin-Lim. Some advanced neural network-based approaches might be worth exploring for high-quality reconstruction.\n\nTry tweaking these parameters and approaches to see if they improve the quality of your audio signal."
