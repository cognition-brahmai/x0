However, when I execute the following code:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\nsubprocess.run([\"ls\", \"-l\", \"/dev/null\"], capture_output=True)\n```\n\nI encounter a `TypeError` that says `__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'capture_output'`. Here's the full traceback:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.6/subprocess.py\", line 403, in run\n    with Popen(*popenargs, **kwargs) as process:\nTypeError: __init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'capture_output'\n```\nI am using Python 3.6.6, as confirmed by running `python3 --version`. Why am I getting this error and how can I fix it?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the `capture_output` argument was introduced in Python 3.7. Since you're using Python 3.6.6, this functionality is not available, and that's why you're seeing the `TypeError`.\n\nTo work around this issue in Python 3.6, you can manually capture the output by using the `stdout` and `stderr` arguments with `subprocess.PIPE`. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve the same result:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\nresult = subprocess.run(\n    [\"ls\", \"-l\", \"/dev/null\"],\n    stdout=subprocess.PIPE,\n    stderr=subprocess.PIPE\n)\n\n# Access the output and errors\noutput = result.stdout\nerrors = result.stderr\n\n# If you wish to print the output as a string:\nprint(output.decode('utf-8'))\nprint(errors.decode('utf-8'))\n```\n\nIn this code, `stdout=subprocess.PIPE` and `stderr=subprocess.PIPE` are used to capture the standard output and standard error, respectively. The output is captured in bytes, so you can use `.decode('utf-8')` to convert it to a string if needed.\n\nYou could consider upgrading to Python 3.7 or later if you want to use the `capture_output` argument directly."
