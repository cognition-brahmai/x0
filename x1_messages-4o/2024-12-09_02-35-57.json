        "content": "In Python, you can create an \"empty if statement\" using the `pass` statement. The `pass` statement is a no-operation statement that serves as a placeholder for future code. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nif mostly_happen_condition:\n    pass  # empty statement\nelse:\n    do_something()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Purpose of `pass`:**\n   - The `pass` statement is used when a statement is syntactically required but you do not want any command or code to execute. It can be useful in places where your code is not yet implemented but you want to maintain the structure of your code.\n\n2. **Performance Consideration:**\n   - Using an empty if statement with `pass` will not improve your application's performance. It simply acts as a placeholder and does not contribute to any computational overhead or optimization.\n   - In Python, the `if` statement itself needs to evaluate the condition, which is the only computational aspect involved. The performance impact of using `pass` is negligible.\n\n3. **Use Cases:**\n   - Typically, `pass` is used during the development phase when you plan to implement functionality later or when you're creating a minimal class or function structure.\n\nIn summary, using `pass` for an empty if statement is more about code structure and readability during development rather than performance improvement. It allows you to define the control flow without executing any action when a condition is met."
