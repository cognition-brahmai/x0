Is there an alternative to cURL in Python that I can use? I am aware of the urllib library but I am not sure how to use it for this purpose."

        "content": "Yes, in Python, you can use the `requests` library, which provides a simple and user-friendly way to make HTTP requests similar to cURL. Here's how you can achieve the same request using the `requests` library in Python:\n\nFirst, you'll need to install the `requests` library if you haven't already. You can do this using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install requests\n```\n\nOnce you have the library installed, you can write a script like this:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth\n\n# Define the URL and credentials\nurl = \"https://app.streamsend.com/emails\"\nusername = \"login\"\npassword = \"key\"\n\n# Set the headers\nheaders = {\n    'Accept': 'application/xml',\n}\n\n# Make the GET request with basic authentication\nresponse = requests.get(url, headers=headers, auth=HTTPBasicAuth(username, password))\n\n# Print the response\nprint(response.status_code)\nprint(response.headers)\nprint(response.text)\n```\n\nThis script makes a GET request to the specified URL with the `Accept: application/xml` header and uses HTTP Basic Authentication with the provided login and key. The response's status code, headers, and body will be printed to the console.\n\n`requests` is a powerful library that can handle various HTTP methods, authentication types, and more. It's a good choice for making HTTP requests in Python due to its simplicity and extensive features."
