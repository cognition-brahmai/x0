The suspects include the victim's ambitious business partner with a shaky alibi, a disgruntled former employee caught on surveillance near the scene, a local journalist with a reputation for bending the truth who claims to have been meeting a source, the victim's estranged wife who stands to gain a fortune, and the mysterious owner of the warehouse who denies any involvement. As forensic evidence points in multiple directions and witness testimonies add layers of complexity, the investigation takes a stunning twist when it's revealed that the murder was orchestrated by the victim himself as part of an elaborate insurance fraud scheme, with the help of a seemingly innocent bystander who was never on the suspect list."
