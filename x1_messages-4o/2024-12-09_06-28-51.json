I know that the `help(keywords)` command prints Python keywords along with some additional information. However, is there a more Pythonic way to obtain an iterable object that contains these keywords as strings?"

        "content": "Yes, there is a more Pythonic way to obtain a list of Python keywords without using the `help()` command. You can use the `keyword` module, which is part of the Python standard library, to get a list of all the keywords. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport keyword\n\n# Get a list of all Python keywords\nkeywords_list = keyword.kwlist\n\n# Print the list of keywords\nprint(keywords_list)\n```\n\nThe `keyword.kwlist` provides you with a list of all the keywords in Python as strings. This list can be iterated over, and you can use it to check if a string is a Python keyword in your program. This approach is clean, Pythonic, and directly leverages the standard library designed for this purpose."
