Here's an example using Python:\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(input_string):\n    # Create an empty set to store unique characters\n    seen = set()\n    # Create a list to store the result\n    result = []\n    # Iterate through each character in the input string\n    for char in input_string:\n        # If the character hasn't been added to the set, add it to both the set and result list\n        if char not in seen:\n            seen.add(char)\n            result.append(char)\n    # Join the result list to form the final string without duplicates\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Example usage\ninput_string = \"programming\"\noutput_string = remove_duplicates(input_string)\nprint(output_string)  # Output: \"progamin\"\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `remove_duplicates` that iterates over each character in the input string. It uses a set to keep track of characters that have already been seen. If a character is not in the set, it's added to both the set and the result list. Finally, the list is joined to form a string without duplicate characters. You can test this function with any string you like."
