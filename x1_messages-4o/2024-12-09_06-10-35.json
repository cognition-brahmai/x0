I have an array like the following:\n\n```python\na = array([[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n           [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n           [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n           [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n           [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]])\n```\nI would like to get an output that only includes the unique rows, like so:\n\n```python\nnew_a = array([[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n               [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n               [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]])\n```\nI am aware that I could use a set and loop over the array, but I am looking for an efficient solution using numpy. I think I could set the data type to void and then use numpy.unique, but I am not sure how to implement it."

        "content": "To find unique rows in a NumPy array efficiently, you can indeed use `numpy.unique` by viewing the array with a structured data type (such as `void`) to treat each row as a single entity. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n              [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n              [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n              [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n              [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]])\n\n# Use numpy.unique with a structured data type\nunique_a = np.unique(a.view([('', a.dtype)]*a.shape[1]))\n\n# Convert back to regular numpy array with the original dtype\nnew_a = unique_a.view(a.dtype).reshape(-1, a.shape[1])\n\nprint(new_a)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **View the Array as a Structured Data Type:** Use `.view([('', a.dtype)]*a.shape[1])` to treat each row as a single entity or record. This step essentially casts the array into a different shape or type without copying the data, allowing you to use `numpy.unique` on rows instead of individual elements.\n\n2. **Use `numpy.unique`:** Apply `numpy.unique` to get the unique rows.\n\n3. **Reshape Back to Original Form:** Since the `unique` function will return a 1D array when operating on structured types, you need to reshape it back to the original 2D form using `.reshape(-1, a.shape[1])`.\n\nThis approach is both efficient and concise, leveraging NumPy's capabilities to handle array operations without explicit loops."
