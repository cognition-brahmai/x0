        "content": "Yes, you can add a line break to your commit message directly from the command line by using a formatted string. While the `-m` option allows you to specify the commit message inline, it doesn't directly support multiline messages. However, you can achieve this by using the following approach:\n\n```bash\ngit commit -m \"First line of the commit message\" -m \"Second line of the commit message\"\n```\n\nEach `-m` flag will add a new line to the commit message. This way, you can create a multiline commit message without needing to open an editor like Vim.\n\nIf you need more complex formatting, such as multiple paragraphs, you can use a combination of `echo` and piping:\n\n```bash\ngit commit -F <(echo -e \"First line of the commit message\\n\\nSecond paragraph of the commit message\")\n```\n\nThis method allows you to have more control over the formatting by using `echo` with the `-e` flag, which interprets backslashes for escape sequences like `\\n` for new lines."
