The desired end result is a list with this structure:\n\n```python\n[['AAA', 'BBB', 'CCC', 'DDD', 'EEE', 'FFF'.....],\n['1', '262', '86', '48', '8', '39', ...],\n['1', '56', '84', '362', '33', '82', ...],\n['10', '238', '149', '205', '96', '89', ...],\n...\n...]\n```\n\nCould someone help me achieve this?"

        "content": "To transpose a nested list in Python, you can use the `zip` function in combination with unpacking. Here's how you can achieve the desired result:\n\n```python\na = [['AAA', '1', '1', '10', '92'], \n     ['BBB', '262', '56', '238', '142'], \n     ['CCC', '86', '84', '149', '30'], \n     ['DDD', '48', '362', '205', '237'], \n     ['EEE', '8', '33', '96', '336'], \n     ['FFF', '39', '82', '89', '140'], \n     ['GGG', '170', '296', '223', '210'], \n     ['HHH', '16', '40', '65', '50'], \n     ['III', '4', '3', '5', '2']]\n\n# Use zip with unpacking to transpose the list\ntransposed = list(map(list, zip(*a)))\n\n# Print the transposed list\nfor row in transposed:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The `zip` function takes iterables and aggregates elements based on their index. Using the unpacking operator `*`, you can pass all sublists in `a` to `zip`, which will then pair elements from each sublist based on their position.\n- `map(list, ...)` is used to convert each tuple returned by `zip` into a list, resulting in a list of lists.\n- Finally, the result is converted into a list using `list()`.\n\nThis will give you the transposed structure you desire."
