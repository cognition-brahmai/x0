After uninstalling Anaconda and deleting all the directories, I installed Python 2.7. However, when I attempt to install PyGTK for Windows, it prompts that it will install to the `c:/users/.../Anaconda directory` which no longer exists. I would like it to install to the `c:/python-2.7` directory. Why is the system behaving as if Anaconda is still installed and how can I change the directory for PyGTK installation?"

        "content": "It sounds like there might be some leftover environment variables or registry entries from your Anaconda installation that are causing the installer to default to the old Anaconda directory. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Environment Variables**:\n   - Open the Start menu, search for \"Environment Variables\", and select \"Edit the system environment variables\".\n   - In the System Properties window, click on the \"Environment Variables\" button.\n   - Look for any variables that might reference Anaconda, such as `PATH`, `PYTHONPATH`, or others. Remove or modify any references to Anaconda so that they point to your new Python 2.7 installation directory (e.g., `C:\\Python-2.7`).\n\n2. **Registry Check**:\n   - Open the Windows Registry Editor by typing `regedit` in the Start menu search and pressing Enter.\n   - Navigate to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software` and `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE`. Look for any folders related to Anaconda or Python that might still be present.\n   - Carefully remove any entries related to Anaconda. Be cautious when editing the registry; creating a backup before making changes is a good practice.\n\n3. **Reinstall PyGTK**:\n   - Now that you've cleaned up the environment variables and registry entries, try running the PyGTK installer again. It should now allow you to specify the correct installation path for Python 2.7.\n\n4. **Check Python Version**:\n   - Ensure that your system recognizes the correct version of Python. Open a command prompt and type `python --version` to confirm it points to Python 2.7.\n\n5. **Reboot Your System**:\n   - After making these changes, reboot your computer to ensure that all changes take effect properly.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and direct PyGTK to install to your Python 2.7 directory."
