I also tried `tf.make_ndarray` to convert a tensor to a numpy array but it gives me an `AttributeError: 'EagerTensor' object has no attribute 'tensor_shape'`.\n\nHere is the code and its output with standard Tensorflow:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nx = tf.convert_to_tensor([0,1,2,3,4], dtype=tf.int64)\ny = x + 10\n\nsess = tf.InteractiveSession()\nsess.run([\n    tf.local_variables_initializer(),\n    tf.global_variables_initializer(),\n])\ncoord = tf.train.Coordinator()\nthreads = tf.train.start_queue_runners(coord=coord)\n\nz = y.eval(feed_dict={x:[0,1,2,3,4]})\nprint(z)\nprint(type(z))\n\ncoord.request_stop()\ncoord.join(threads)\nsess.close()\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```python\n[10 11 12 13 14]\n<class 'numpy.ndarray'>\n```\n\nAnd here is the code and its output with eager execution:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.enable_eager_execution() # requires r1.7\n\nx = tf.convert_to_tensor([0,1,2,3,4], dtype=tf.int64)\ny = x + 10\n\nprint(y)\nprint(type(y))\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```python\ntf.Tensor([10 11 12 13 14], shape=(5,), dtype=int64)\n<class 'EagerTensor'>\n```"

        "content": "In TensorFlow with eager execution enabled, converting an `EagerTensor` to a NumPy array is straightforward. You can directly use the `.numpy()` method available on the `EagerTensor` object. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Enable eager execution\ntf.compat.v1.enable_eager_execution()\n\nx = tf.convert_to_tensor([0, 1, 2, 3, 4], dtype=tf.int64)\ny = x + 10\n\n# Convert the EagerTensor to a NumPy array\nz = y.numpy()\n\nprint(z)\nprint(type(z))\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```python\n[10 11 12 13 14]\n<class 'numpy.ndarray'>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Eager Execution**: This mode allows operations to be executed immediately as they are called within Python. This makes it easier to debug and work interactively.\n\n- **Converting to NumPy**: The `.numpy()` method is specifically designed to convert an `EagerTensor` to a NumPy array. This method is only available when eager execution is enabled, making the conversion seamless.\n\n- **Code Adjustments**: Notice that with eager execution, you don't need to use sessions or coordinators. The operations are executed immediately, and evaluation methods like `eval()` are not necessary.\n\nThis approach is efficient and leverages TensorFlow's eager execution capabilities to handle tensors in a more Pythonic way, similar to working with NumPy arrays."
