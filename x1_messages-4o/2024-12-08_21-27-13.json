Here's a recipe for gluten-free raspberry scones using almond flour and coconut sugar, formatted in a LaTeX table:\n\n\\[ \\text{Table: Ingredients for Raspberry Scones} \\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{ |p{3cm}||p{3cm}| }\n \\hline\n \\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\\text{Ingredients}} \\\\\n \\hline\n \\text{Almond Flour} & \\text{2 cups} \\\\\n \\text{Coconut Sugar} & \\text{1/4 cup} \\\\\n \\text{Baking Powder} & \\text{1 tbsp} \\\\\n \\text{Salt} & \\text{1/4 tsp} \\\\\n \\text{Frozen Raspberries} & \\text{1 cup} \\\\\n \\text{Almond Milk} & \\text{1/2 cup} \\\\\n \\text{Coconut Oil} & \\text{1/4 cup} \\\\\n \\text{Egg} & \\text{1} \\\\\n \\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n**Instructions:**\n1. Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).\n2. In a large bowl, mix together the almond flour, coconut sugar, baking powder, and salt.\n3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the almond milk, melted coconut oil, and egg.\n4. Combine the wet and dry ingredients until just mixed.\n5. Gently fold in the frozen raspberries.\n6. Scoop the dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, forming small mounds.\n7. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until the scones are golden and a toothpick inserted comes out clean.\n8. Allow to cool on a wire rack before serving.\n\nAnd for the LaTeX code:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{4} \\times \\sqrt{32} + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{i}\n\\]\n\nThis formula includes two components: the product of three-fourths and the square root of 32, and the summation of the harmonic series up to \\( n \\)."
