I am currently building a web interface to mock up a restful interface on a networking device that uses Digest Authentication and HTTPS.

        "content": "To add HTTPS functionality to a Flask web server, you need to serve your Flask application over an SSL/TLS connection. This typically involves using an SSL certificate. For development purposes, you can create a self-signed certificate. In a production environment, you would use a certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority.\n\nHere's how you can modify your Flask app to use HTTPS with a self-signed certificate:\n\n1. **Generate a self-signed certificate and key:**\n\n   You can use OpenSSL to generate a self-signed certificate and private key. Run the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365\n   ```\n\n   This command will generate a `key.pem` and `cert.pem` file. During the process, you'll be asked to provide some information for the certificate.\n\n2. **Modify your Flask app to use the certificate and key:**\n\n   Update your Flask app to use these files when running the server. Here's the modified code:\n\n   ```python\n   from flask import Flask, jsonify\n\n   app = Flask(__name__)\n\n   @app.route('/')\n   def index():\n       return 'Flask is running!'\n\n   @app.route('/data')\n   def names():\n       data = {\"names\": [\"John\", \"Jacob\", \"Julie\", \"Jennifer\"]}\n       return jsonify(data)\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       # Specify the paths to the certificate and key\n       context = ('cert.pem', 'key.pem')\n       # Run the app with SSL context\n       app.run(ssl_context=context)\n   ```\n\n3. **Run your Flask app:**\n\n   When you run your Flask app now, it should be accessible via HTTPS. Note that your browser might warn you about the self-signed certificate, which is expected since it's not from a trusted Certificate Authority.\n\n4. **Access your server:**\n\n   Open your web browser and go to `https://localhost:5000/`. You should see your Flask app running with HTTPS.\n\nRemember, self-signed certificates are suitable for development and testing, but for production, you should obtain an SSL certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). You can use services like Let's Encrypt to get free SSL certificates for your domain."
