Additionally, filter the results to only include products that are currently in stock (UnitsInStock > 0) and belong to the \"Electronics\" category (CategoryID = 1).

        "content": "To achieve the desired results, we will need to write a SQL query that includes a JOIN operation between the \"Products\" table and a \"Categories\" table to retrieve the category name. We will then filter, sort, and limit the results accordingly.\n\nHere's how you can construct the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    p.ProductID, \n    p.ProductName, \n    c.CategoryName, \n    p.UnitPrice, \n    p.UnitsInStock, \n    p.DateAdded\nFROM \n    Products p\nJOIN \n    Categories c ON p.CategoryID = c.CategoryID\nWHERE \n    p.UnitsInStock > 0 \n    AND p.CategoryID = 1\nORDER BY \n    p.DateAdded DESC\nLIMIT 5;\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **SELECT Statement**: Retrieves the required columns from the \"Products\" table and the \"CategoryName\" from the \"Categories\" table.\n\n2. **FROM Clause**: Specifies the \"Products\" table as the primary table.\n\n3. **JOIN Operation**: Joins the \"Products\" table with the \"Categories\" table using the `CategoryID` column to get the category name.\n\n4. **WHERE Clause**: Applies the filters to only include products that are in stock (`UnitsInStock > 0`) and belong to the \"Electronics\" category (`CategoryID = 1`).\n\n5. **ORDER BY Clause**: Sorts the results by the `DateAdded` column in descending order to get the most recently added products.\n\n6. **LIMIT Clause**: Limits the output to the last 5 products that meet the filtering criteria."
