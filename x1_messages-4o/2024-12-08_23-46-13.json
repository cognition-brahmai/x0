While blockchain is a well-known type of DLT, the term encompasses various technologies that use consensus algorithms to maintain a decentralized, tamper-resistant ledger.\n\nThe term used for a database system that stores data in a hierarchical structure with limited scalability and inefficient access control mechanisms is typically referred to as a \"Hierarchical Database.\" These databases organize data in a tree-like structure, where each record has a single parent, which can lead to challenges in scalability and access control."
