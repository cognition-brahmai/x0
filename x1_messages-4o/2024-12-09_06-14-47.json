The emails are sent from views.py, but in order to attach the files, I need to get the full path name of the image(s) so Python can open them. These files are in the static folder in my app, but I can't seem to find a way that I can get the full path of the file on the filesystem. This method needs to work in development mode, as it works fine in production after collecting static, but in dev, it can't find the file as the static files are served from individual app folders in development."

        "content": "To access static files in Django during development, you can use the `find` method from the `django.contrib.staticfiles` module. This method will help you locate the full file path of a static file. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n1. First, ensure that `django.contrib.staticfiles` is included in your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting. This is typically already included in a standard Django setup.\n\n2. Use the following approach in your `views.py` to locate the full path of a static file:\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib.staticfiles import finders\n\ndef get_static_file_path(file_name):\n    # Use the finders module to get the full path\n    file_path = finders.find(file_name)\n    if file_path:\n        return file_path\n    else:\n        raise FileNotFoundError(f\"Static file {file_name} not found.\")\n\n# Example usage:\nfile_path = get_static_file_path('images/example_image.jpg')\nprint(file_path)  # This will print the full path of the file\n```\n\nIn development mode, `finders.find()` will look for the file in your static directories as specified in `STATICFILES_DIRS` or within the `static` subdirectory of any of your apps.\n\n3. Once you have the file path, you can use it to open the file and attach it to your email as needed.\n\nThis method allows you to dynamically locate static files during development without relying on the static files being collected, which is necessary for production environments."
