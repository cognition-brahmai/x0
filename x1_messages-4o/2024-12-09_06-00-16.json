However, I'm having issues with caching. Every time I save this read frame with the same name, the browsers cache it. I have attempted to disable caching using HTML meta-tags and modifying the `resp` headers in Flask, but both Google Chrome and Safari still cache the information. How can I disable caching in Flask?\n\nHere is the code I used to set the headers:\n```\nr = make_response(render_template('video.html', video_info=video_info))\n\nr.headers[\"Cache-Control\"] = \"no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate\"\nr.headers[\"Pragma\"] = \"no-cache\"\nr.headers[\"Expires\"] = \"0\"\n```\nAnd here are the HTML meta-tags:\n```\n<meta http-equiv=\"Cache-Control\" content=\"no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate\" />\n<meta http-equiv=\"Pragma\" content=\"no-cache\" />\n<meta http-equiv=\"Expires\" content=\"0\" />\n```\nWhat could be the problem here?"

However, there are several strategies you can employ to ensure the most up-to-date version of your content is served. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Use Unique URLs for Each Frame:**\n   One common approach is to append a query string parameter with a timestamp or a unique identifier to the URL of the image. This effectively makes the URL unique each time, which prevents caching.\n\n   ```python\n   import time\n\n   @app.route('/video_feed')\n   def video_feed():\n       video_info = {\n           'frame_url': f'/static/frame.jpg?{int(time.time())}'\n       }\n       r = make_response(render_template('video.html', video_info=video_info))\n       r.headers[\"Cache-Control\"] = \"no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate\"\n       r.headers[\"Pragma\"] = \"no-cache\"\n       r.headers[\"Expires\"] = \"0\"\n       return r\n   ```\n\n   In your HTML, you would reference `video_info['frame_url']` to get the image URL.\n\n2. **Check Server and Proxy Caching:**\n   Ensure that there are no server-side or intermediate proxies caching your responses. Sometimes, caching can occur at other levels apart from the browser.\n\n3. **Service Worker Caching:**\n   If you have service workers implemented, they might intercept requests and serve cached responses. Make sure they are configured to bypass caching for your specific resources.\n\n4. **Ensure Headers Are Applied Correctly:**\n   Double-check that the headers are being applied to the correct responses. You can use developer tools in the browser (Network tab) to inspect the HTTP headers and verify that the cache-control headers are present.\n\n5. **Clear Browser Cache:**\n   For development purposes, clear your browser cache or use incognito mode to ensure you're not seeing a cached version.\n\n6. **Different Filename for Each Frame:**\n   If feasible, save each frame with a different filename instead of overwriting the same file. This can be more storage-intensive but guarantees that each frame is fresh.\n\nBy combining some of these strategies, you should be able to effectively prevent caching of your frames in the browser."
