I was expecting that `x()` would return 42, but it seems that `x` ends up recursively referring to itself, so that `x()`, `x()()`, etc. are all functions. What is the rule used to parse this, and where is this documented? Also, it seems that the original value of `x` has no references left after the lambda definition, as demonstrated by the following code:\n\n```python\nclass X:\n  def __del__(self): print('deleting')\n\nx = X()\nx = lambda: x  # 'deleting' is printed here\n```"

        "content": "In Python, when you define a lambda function like `x = lambda: x`, the `x` inside the lambda refers to the variable `x` in the enclosing scope, which in this case is the same `x` that the lambda is being assigned to. This creates a recursive reference where the lambda keeps referring to itself.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of what's happening:\n\n1. Initially, `x` is assigned the value `42`.\n2. Then, you redefine `x` to be a lambda function: `x = lambda: x`.\n3. At the time of the lambda definition, `x` refers to the function itself, not the original integer `42`. This is because Python uses late binding for closures, meaning that the value of `x` is looked up when the lambda is called, not when it's defined.\n\nBecause of this behavior, when you call `x()`, it returns the lambda function itself, thus resulting in a recursive function call if you continue calling it.\n\nRegarding the garbage collection of the original `x`, once you reassign `x` to the lambda, the original reference to the integer `42` is lost. In your example with the class `X`, the `__del__` method is called immediately after `x` is reassigned to the lambda, indicating that the original instance of `X` is no longer referenced and is being garbage collected.\n\nThis behavior is part of Python's scoping rules and the way closures work. The documentation on closures and scope in Python can be found in the official Python documentation under the sections about functions and scopes. You can find more detailed information in the Python Language Reference, specifically in the sections about function definitions and execution models."
