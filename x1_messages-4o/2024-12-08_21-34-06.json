        "content": "The differences between the Hanafi and Maliki schools of Islamic jurisprudence primarily revolve around their interpretations and applications of Sharia law, particularly in matters of family law. Here\u2019s a detailed comparison of how these differences impact legal decisions in cases involving family law:\n\n### Divorce:\n- **Hanafi School:**\n  - Talaq (divorce) can be initiated by the husband and can be given in written form or through a delegate.\n  - The woman generally has no right to initiate divorce herself, unless stipulated in the marriage contract (Talaq-e-Tafweez).\n\n- **Maliki School:**\n  - Talaq must be given orally by the husband.\n  - Women have the right to initiate divorce under certain circumstances, such as harm or mistreatment (Khula).\n\n### Child Custody:\n- **Hanafi School:**\n  - Custody of children is primarily with the mother until the age of 7. After this age, custody may be transferred to the father.\n\n- **Maliki School:**\n  - Custody remains with the mother until the children reach puberty. After reaching this age, custody can be reconsidered, potentially transferring to the father.\n\n### Inheritance:\n- **Hanafi School:**\n  - Male heirs receive double the share of female heirs, based on the traditional interpretation of Quranic injunctions.\n\n- **Maliki School:**\n  - Advocates for a more equal distribution, with male and female heirs potentially receiving equal shares, depending on the specific circumstances and other heirs involved.\n\nHere\u2019s a JSON representation of these differences:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Hanafi\": {\n    \"divorce\": {\n      \"initiation\": \"Talaq can be given in written form or through a delegate\",\n      \"women_rights\": \"Women generally cannot initiate divorce\"\n    },\n    \"child_custody\": {\n      \"mother_custody\": \"Until age 7\",\n      \"father_custody\": \"After age 7\"\n    },\n    \"inheritance\": {\n      \"male_share\": \"Double the share of female heirs\",\n      \"female_share\": \"Half the share of male heirs\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"Maliki\": {\n    \"divorce\": {\n      \"initiation\": \"Talaq must be given orally\",\n      \"women_rights\": \"Women can initiate divorce under certain circumstances\"\n    },\n    \"child_custody\": {\n      \"mother_custody\": \"Until puberty\",\n      \"father_custody\": \"After puberty\"\n    },\n    \"inheritance\": {\n      \"male_share\": \"Equal to the share of female heirs\",\n      \"female_share\": \"Equal to the share of male heirs\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThese differences can significantly impact legal decisions in family law cases, affecting outcomes related to divorce rights, custody arrangements, and inheritance distributions. The interpretation and application of these rules can vary depending on the country and the legal framework in place, as well as individual circumstances."
