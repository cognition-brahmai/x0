For instance, I want to execute the following command where I can remove the first N characters:\n\n<pre><code>tail -f logfile | grep org.springframework | <command to remove first N characters>\n</code></pre>\n\nI am considering using the `tr` command but I'm unsure about its ability to perform this task. Can anyone provide a solution for this?"

The `cut` command is designed to extract sections from each line of input.\n\nHere's how you can modify your command using `cut`:\n\n```bash\ntail -f logfile | grep org.springframework | cut -c$((N+1))-\n```\n\nIn this command, replace `N` with the number of characters you want to remove from the beginning of each line. The `cut -c$((N+1))-` portion specifies that you want to cut from character `N+1` to the end of each line, effectively removing the first `N` characters.\n\nThis approach is simple and efficient for processing the output on a per-line basis."
