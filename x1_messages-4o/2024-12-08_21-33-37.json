Let the protagonist's first name be represented by $p$, the mother of the child be represented by $m$, the first responder be represented by $r$, and the bystander be represented by $b$. Given that $|m| = |\\text{siblings of }p|$, $|r| = 2|p|$, and $|b| = |p|-1$, what is the value of $|p|+|m|+|r|+|b|$?"

However, without additional information, assume that this is directly related to \\( |p| \\) and we will need more context for this equation. For now, let's solve other equations.\n\nNow, from the conditions:\n- \\( |r| = 2|p| \\)\n- \\( |b| = |p| - 1 \\)\n\nSubstitute these into the expression we need to evaluate:\n\\[\n|p| + |m| + |r| + |b| = |p| + |m| + 2|p| + (|p| - 1)\n\\]\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\\[\n4|p| + |m| - 1\n\\]\n\nWe don't have a direct relationship for \\( |m| \\) in terms of \\( |p| \\) other than \\( |m| = |\\text{siblings of } p| \\), which is not numerically defined here. Assuming there is an oversight and \\( |m| = |p| \\) (a common assumption for simplification in such problems), we proceed with:\n\\[\n|m| = |p|\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( |m| = |p| \\) into the expression:\n\\[\n4|p| + |p| - 1 = 5|p| - 1\n\\]\n\nTo solve this, we need additional information about \\( |p| \\). If \\( |p| \\) is a small integer that logically satisfies these conditions (since the names typically aren't very long), assume:\n- \\( |p| = 2 \\)\n\nThen calculate each:\n- \\( |m| = |p| = 2 \\)\n- \\( |r| = 2|p| = 4 \\)\n- \\( |b| = |p| - 1 = 1 \\)\n\nNow substitute back:\n\\[\n|p| + |m| + |r| + |b| = 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 9\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of letters is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]"
