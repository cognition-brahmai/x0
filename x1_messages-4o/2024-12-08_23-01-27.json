The program should also output the prime numbers in the list and their positions. Additionally, the program should be able to handle input in both decimal and binary formats and output the results in hexadecimal format. Finally, the program should be able to handle errors such as invalid input and divide-by-zero errors."

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to create a program that processes a list of numbers from 1 to 100, performs various calculations, and handles both decimal and binary inputs. Below is a Python program that accomplishes these tasks:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(num):\n    if num < 2:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef process_numbers(numbers):\n    sum_of_odds = 0\n    sum_of_evens = 0\n    count_of_evens = 0\n    primes = []\n\n    for index, num in enumerate(numbers):\n        if num % 2 != 0:\n            sum_of_odds += num\n        else:\n            sum_of_evens += num\n            count_of_evens += 1\n\n        if is_prime(num):\n            primes.append((num, index))\n\n    average_of_evens = sum_of_evens / count_of_evens if count_of_evens != 0 else 0\n\n    return sum_of_odds, average_of_evens, primes\n\ndef convert_to_hexadecimal(value):\n    return hex(value)\n\ndef main():\n    input_data = input(\"Enter numbers from 1 to 100 in decimal or binary format (comma-separated): \")\n    \n    try:\n        # Split input and convert to integers\n        numbers = []\n        for item in input_data.split(','):\n            item = item.strip()\n            if item.startswith('0b'):  # Binary input\n                numbers.append(int(item, 2))\n            else:  # Decimal input\n                numbers.append(int(item))\n\n        # Validate numbers are within the range 1-100\n        if not all(1 <= num <= 100 for num in numbers):\n            raise ValueError(\"All numbers must be in the range from 1 to 100.\")\n\n        sum_of_odds, average_of_evens, primes = process_numbers(numbers)\n\n        # Output results in hexadecimal\n        print(f\"Sum of odd numbers (hex): {convert_to_hexadecimal(sum_of_odds)}\")\n        print(f\"Average of even numbers (hex): {convert_to_hexadecimal(int(average_of_evens))}\")\n        print(\"Prime numbers and their positions:\")\n        for prime, position in primes:\n            print(f\"Number: {convert_to_hexadecimal(prime)}, Position: {position}\")\n\n    except ValueError as ve:\n        print(f\"Invalid input: {ve}\")\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        print(\"Error: Division by zero occurred while calculating the average of even numbers.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Prime Check Function**: `is_prime(num)` checks if a number is prime.\n\n2. **Processing Function**: `process_numbers(numbers)` computes:\n   - Sum of odd numbers.\n   - Average of even numbers.\n   - List of prime numbers and their indices.\n\n3. **Hexadecimal Conversion**: `convert_to_hexadecimal(value)` converts a number to hexadecimal.\n\n4. **Main Logic**:\n   - Takes user input, which may contain numbers in decimal or binary format.\n   - Converts binary numbers to decimal and ensures all numbers are within the 1-100 range.\n   - Calls `process_numbers` to perform calculations.\n   - Prints results in hexadecimal format.\n   - Catches and handles `ValueError` for invalid inputs and `ZeroDivisionError` for division by zero.\n\nThis program should handle most input errors gracefully and perform the required calculations, outputting results in hexadecimal format as specified."
