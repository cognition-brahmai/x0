I have a series of Python classes in a file, where some classes reference others. For instance:\n\n```python\nclass A():\n    pass\n\nclass B():\n    c = C()\n\nclass C():\n    pass\n```\n\nWhen I try to run this, I encounter a `NameError: name 'C' is not defined`. Is there a way to make this work without manually reordering my classes? I'm actually using Django models, but I've simplified the problem for clarity."

        "content": "In Python, you don't have class prototypes or forward declarations like you do in C++, but there are several strategies you can use to handle situations where classes reference each other before they are fully defined. Here are a few approaches you can consider:\n\n1. **Reordering Classes**: Although you mentioned you'd like to avoid this, the simplest solution is often to reorder the classes so that the referenced class is defined before it is used.\n\n2. **Using Strings for Forward References**: In some cases, you can use string literals to refer to a class by name instead of using the class itself. This is especially common in Django models when defining relationships.\n\n   For example:\n   ```python\n   class A:\n       pass\n\n   class B:\n       c = 'C'\n\n   class C:\n       pass\n   ```\n\n3. **Postponing Initialization**: If the reference is not needed at the time of class definition, you can define your class attributes or methods using `None` or a placeholder, and then initialize them later, such as in the `__init__` method.\n\n   ```python\n   class A:\n       pass\n\n   class B:\n       def __init__(self):\n           self.c = None  # Initialize later\n\n   class C:\n       pass\n\n   b = B()\n   b.c = C()  # Now C is defined, and you can assign it\n   ```\n\n4. **Using `locals()` or `globals()` for Dynamic Resolution**: You can use Python's `locals()` or `globals()` functions to dynamically resolve class names. This is a more advanced technique and should be used carefully.\n\n   ```python\n   class A:\n       pass\n\n   class B:\n       def __init__(self):\n           self.c = globals()['C']()  # Dynamically resolve C\n\n   class C:\n       pass\n\n   b = B()\n   ```\n\n5. **Using Type Hints with Forward References**: If you're using Python 3.7 or later, you can use future annotations which allow you to postpone the evaluation of type annotations.\n\n   ```python\n   from __future__ import annotations\n\n   class A:\n       pass\n\n   class B:\n       c: C  # Forward reference\n\n   class C:\n       pass\n\n   b = B()\n   b.c = C()\n   ```\n\nThese techniques can help you manage forward references in Python. The best choice depends on your specific use case and the complexity of your class relationships. In Django, using string-based references for related models is quite common and recommended for defining relationships."
