        "content": "In Python, the behavior of the `+=` operator can indeed differ from the `i = i + x` operation, but this difference is specific to mutable objects rather than immutable ones.\n\nFor immutable types like integers, strings, and tuples, `i += x` and `i = i + x` are functionally equivalent. Both create a new object and reassign the name `i` to this new object.\n\nHowever, for mutable types like lists, there is a difference:\n\n```python\n# Using += with mutable objects like lists:\nlst = [1, 2, 3]\nlst += [4, 5]  # This modifies the list in place\n\n# Equivalent to:\nlst.extend([4, 5])\n```\n\nIn this case, `lst += [4, 5]` modifies the original list object in place by extending it. \n\nOn the other hand:\n\n```python\n# Using = with addition:\nlst = [1, 2, 3]\nlst = lst + [4, 5]  # This creates a new list object\n\n# Equivalent to:\nlst = lst.__add__([4, 5])\n```\n\nHere, `lst = lst + [4, 5]` creates a new list object and assigns it back to `lst`. The original object referenced by `lst` before the operation is not modified.\n\nThe key difference lies in whether the operation modifies the object in place (as with `+=`) or creates a new object (as with `=` and `+`). This distinction is important when other references to the original object exist, as in-place modifications will be visible through all references, while reassignment will not affect other references."
