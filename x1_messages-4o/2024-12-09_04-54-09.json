The Python list method is as follows:\n\n```python\na = [2, 3, 1]\nb = [4, 6, 7]\na, b = zip(*sorted(zip(a,b)))\nprint(a)  # Outputs: (1, 2, 3)\nprint(b)  # Outputs: (7, 4, 6)\n```\n\nHow can I achieve the same result with numpy arrays, without unpacking them to standard Python lists?"

        "content": "To achieve the same result with NumPy arrays, you can use `numpy.argsort` to get the indices that would sort the first array, and then apply those indices to both arrays to sort them accordingly. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the arrays\na = np.array([2, 3, 1])\nb = np.array([4, 6, 7])\n\n# Get the indices that would sort array 'a'\nsorted_indices = np.argsort(a)\n\n# Use the sorted indices to sort both arrays\na_sorted = a[sorted_indices]\nb_sorted = b[sorted_indices]\n\nprint(a_sorted)  # Outputs: [1 2 3]\nprint(b_sorted)  # Outputs: [7 4 6]\n```\n\nThis method keeps everything within NumPy without converting to Python lists, and it efficiently sorts both arrays based on the values of the first array."
