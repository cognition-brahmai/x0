The program should allow user input for the size of the array and the elements and should have a time complexity of O(n^2). Additionally, could you provide an example input array, such as [7, 2, 9, 5, 1]? Please format your code using Mark down format for easier readability."

        "content": "Certainly! Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name because smaller elements \"bubble\" to the top of the list.\n\n### Bubble Sort Algorithm Steps:\n1. Start with the first element in the array.\n2. Compare the current element with the next element.\n3. If the current element is greater than the next element, swap them.\n4. Move to the next element and repeat steps 2 and 3 until the end of the array is reached.\n5. Repeat steps 1 through 4 for all elements in the array.\n6. The process is repeated until no swaps are needed, indicating the array is sorted.\n\n### C++ Implementation:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\n\n// Function to perform Bubble Sort\nvoid bubbleSort(int arr[], int n) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {\n        // Last i elements are already sorted\n        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {\n            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {\n                // Swap arr[j] and arr[j + 1]\n                int temp = arr[j];\n                arr[j] = arr[j + 1];\n                arr[j + 1] = temp;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Function to print the array\nvoid printArray(int arr[], int n) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        cout << arr[i] << \" \";\n    }\n    cout << endl;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    cout << \"Enter the number of elements: \";\n    cin >> n;\n    int arr[n];\n    cout << \"Enter \" << n << \" elements:\" << endl;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        cin >> arr[i];\n    }\n\n    cout << \"Unsorted array: \";\n    printArray(arr, n);\n\n    bubbleSort(arr, n);\n\n    cout << \"Sorted array in ascending order: \";\n    printArray(arr, n);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Example:\nLet's take an example input array: `[7, 2, 9, 5, 1]`.\n\n- **Input:**\n  ```\n  Enter the number of elements: 5\n  Enter 5 elements:\n  7 2 9 5 1\n  ```\n\n- **Output:**\n  ```\n  Unsorted array: 7 2 9 5 1 \n  Sorted array in ascending order: 1 2 5 7 9 \n  ```\n\n### Explanation:\nFor the given input, the Bubble Sort algorithm will execute as follows:\n1. In the first pass: [7, 2, 9, 5, 1] \u2192 [2, 7, 9, 5, 1] \u2192 [2, 7, 5, 9, 1] \u2192 [2, 7, 5, 1, 9]\n2. In the second pass: [2, 7, 5, 1, 9] \u2192 [2, 5, 7, 1, 9] \u2192 [2, 5, 1, 7, 9]\n3. In the third pass: [2, 5, 1, 7, 9] \u2192 [2, 1, 5, 7, 9]\n4. In the fourth pass: [1, 2, 5, 7, 9] (No swaps needed, array is sorted)\n\nThe time complexity of Bubble Sort is \\(O(n^2)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of elements in the array. This is because of the nested loops: one for traversing the array and another for comparing adjacent elements."
