For your specific case, where you want to join the elements with commas, you can use the following approach:\n\n```bash\nFOO=(a b c)\njoined=$(IFS=,; echo \"${FOO[*]}\")\necho \"$joined\"\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of how it works:\n\n- `IFS=,`: Temporarily sets the Internal Field Separator (IFS) to a comma. IFS is used by Bash to determine how to do word splitting.\n- `\"${FOO[*]}\"`: Expands the array `FOO` into a single string where each element is separated by the first character of `IFS`, which we set to a comma.\n- `echo \"$joined\"`: Outputs the resulting joined string.\n\nThis will give you the desired output: `a,b,c`."
