        "content": "In Python 2.x, the built-in round function rounds equally close multiples away from 0 (so, for example, round(0.5) is 1.0 and round(-0.5) is -1.0). However, this behavior has changed in Python 3.x where if two multiples are equally close, rounding is done toward the even choice (so, for example, both round(0.5) and round(-0.5) are 0, and round(1.5) is 2). Is there a way to use the Python 3.x rounding behavior in Python 2.x? Unfortunately, the future_builtins module doesn't include this. Is there another module I haven't found yet? Or, is there another way to integrate Python 3.x functions into Python 2.x? I could write a new function that produces the desired behavior, but I'm interested to know if a solution exists that uses the actual Python 3.x function, to avoid adding unnecessary complexity and code to maintain."

        "content": "To achieve Python 3.x's rounding behavior in Python 2.x, you would need to implement your own version of the \"round half to even\" behavior (also known as \"bankers' rounding\") since Python 2.x's built-in `round` function doesn't support it. While there isn't a direct way to import Python 3.x's functions into Python 2.x, you can use a custom function to achieve the same effect. Here's a way to do it:\n\n```python\ndef round_half_to_even(n):\n    # Separate the number into its integer and fractional parts\n    integer_part, fractional_part = divmod(abs(n), 1)\n\n    # Determine if the fractional part is exactly 0.5\n    if fractional_part == 0.5:\n        # If the integer part is even, return the integer part\n        if integer_part % 2 == 0:\n            result = integer_part\n        else:\n            # If the integer part is odd, return the next integer\n            result = integer_part + 1\n    else:\n        # If the fractional part is not 0.5, use the standard rounding\n        result = round(n)\n\n    # Return the result with the original sign\n    return result if n >= 0 else -result\n\n# Examples\nprint(round_half_to_even(0.5))  # Output: 0\nprint(round_half_to_even(-0.5)) # Output: 0\nprint(round_half_to_even(1.5))  # Output: 2\nprint(round_half_to_even(2.5))  # Output: 2\n```\n\nThis function mimics Python 3.x's \"round half to even\" behavior by checking if the fractional part of the number is exactly 0.5 and then rounding based on the parity of the integer part. This method should work well for most practical purposes.\n\nIf you absolutely need to use Python 3.x's exact `round` function in Python 2.x for some reason, you would need to run a Python 3.x interpreter and call it from a separate process or convert your entire codebase to Python 3.x, which is generally a recommended approach as Python 2.x is no longer supported."
