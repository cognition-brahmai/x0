        "content": "The error you're encountering typically suggests that there's a mismatch in the function call or an incorrect argument being passed. In your case, the issue seems to be related to the initialization or configuration of a Flask blueprint.\n\nHere are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Blueprint Registration:**\n   Ensure that you are importing and registering the blueprint correctly. The `register_blueprint` method of the Flask app does not take a `method` argument, so make sure you're not inadvertently passing it anywhere in your code.\n\n2. **Blueprint Definition:**\n   Verify that the blueprint is defined correctly. Here's a basic example of how a blueprint should be set up:\n\n   ```python\n   from flask import Blueprint\n\n   main_blueprint = Blueprint('main', __name__)\n\n   @main_blueprint.route('/')\n   def home():\n       return \"Welcome to the main blueprint\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Correct Blueprint Registration:**\n   Make sure you are registering the blueprint without any extraneous arguments:\n\n   ```python\n   from flask import Flask\n   from your_module import main_blueprint\n\n   app = Flask(__name__)\n   app.register_blueprint(main_blueprint, url_prefix='/main')\n   ```\n\n4. **Traceback Inspection:**\n   Carefully inspect the full traceback to see if there are any additional clues or if the error might originate from another part of the code.\n\n5. **Dependencies and Compatibility:**\n   Ensure that all your Flask-related packages are up to date and compatible with each other. Sometimes, issues arise from version mismatches.\n\n6. **Code Review:**\n   Review the rest of your codebase to make sure there are no other definitions or calls that might inadvertently use a `method` argument where it shouldn't be.\n\n7. **Check for Custom Modifications:**\n   If you've extended or modified any core Flask functionality or if you have custom decorators or middleware, verify that none of these introduce a `method` keyword argument by mistake.\n\nBy going through these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue causing the `TypeError`. If the problem persists, consider isolating the blueprint registration in a minimal example to further diagnose the issue."
