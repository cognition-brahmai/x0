Is this not inconsistent with the recommendation of having spaces around every other occurrence of '=' in Python code? For example, why is \n\n```python\nfunc(1, 2, very_long_variable_name=another_very_long_variable_name)\n```\n\nbetter than:\n\n```python\nfunc(1, 2, very_long_variable_name = another_very_long_variable_name)\n```\n\nI am not looking for opinions but rather the reasoning behind this decision. Are there any discussions or explanations by Python's BDFL on this topic?"

        "content": "PEP 8, the style guide for Python code, recommends not having spaces around the `=` sign when used for keyword arguments or default parameter values in function definitions and calls. The reasoning behind this guideline is primarily related to readability and consistency within these specific contexts.\n\n### Reasons for This Recommendation:\n\n1. **Clarity and Distinction**: \n   - The absence of spaces around the `=` sign in keyword arguments helps visually distinguish these arguments from assignments or other uses of the `=` operator. It becomes a visual cue that you are dealing with keyword arguments rather than variable assignments within the function call.\n\n2. **Consistency with Default Parameters**:\n   - In function definitions, default parameters are specified without spaces around the `=` to maintain consistency with the keyword arguments convention. This helps readers of the code quickly identify default values in function signatures.\n\n3. **Readability in Function Calls**:\n   - By not including spaces, it helps keep the function calls more compact, which can be especially beneficial in cases where there are multiple keyword arguments or when dealing with nested function calls. This can improve readability by reducing the visual clutter in these dense sections of code.\n\n### Discussions by Python's BDFL:\n\nThere is no specific record of Guido van Rossum, Python's Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL), providing an in-depth explanation for this particular aspect of PEP 8. However, PEP 8 itself was written with input from several Python core developers and reflects a consensus on code style that enhances readability and consistency across Python codebases.\n\nPEP 8 is a guideline and not a strict rule; there might be cases where deviating from it could make your code more readable in a specific context. However, following PEP 8 helps maintain a uniform style, making it easier for developers to read and share code."
