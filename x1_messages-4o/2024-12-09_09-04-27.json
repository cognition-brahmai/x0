        "content": "To calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and N in a Java program, you can use a simple loop to iterate through the numbers and add the even ones to a sum variable. Here's a sample code:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class SumOfEvenNumbers {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        \n        System.out.print(\"Enter the value of N: \");\n        int N = scanner.nextInt();\n        \n        int sum = 0;\n        \n        for (int i = 2; i <= N; i += 2) {\n            sum += i;\n        }\n        \n        System.out.println(\"The sum of all even numbers between 1 and \" + N + \" is: \" + sum);\n        \n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Scanner**: We use `Scanner` to read the value of N from the user.\n2. **Loop**: The `for` loop starts from 2 and increments by 2 each time (`i += 2`), thereby only considering even numbers.\n3. **Sum Calculation**: In each iteration, the current even number `i` is added to the `sum`.\n4. **Output**: Finally, the sum of all even numbers is printed.\n\nThis code efficiently calculates the sum by only looping through even numbers, making it faster than checking each number for evenness."
