However, each cell in this column can result in a different number of columns after split. I am looking for a solution using pandas or Python to split these cells into multiple rows. For instance, I want to take records such as John Lennon's and create multiple lines, with the information from each set of seats on a separate line. How can I accomplish this?"

        "content": "To achieve this task using pandas in Python, you can follow these steps to split the 'Seatblocks' column by both space and colon delimiters, and then expand these splits into multiple rows. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you accomplish this:\n\n1. **Import pandas**: First, ensure that you have pandas installed and import it into your Python script.\n\n2. **Load the CSV**: Read the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.\n\n3. **Split and Expand**: Use the `str.split()` method to split the 'Seatblocks' column by space and colon, then expand the resulting lists into separate rows.\n\n4. **Melt the DataFrame**: Reorganize the DataFrame so that each part of the split 'Seatblocks' is in a separate row.\n\nHere's a sample code to guide you through the process:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the CSV file into a DataFrame\ndf = pd.read_csv('your_file.csv')\n\n# Define a function to split the 'Seatblocks' column by space and colon\ndef split_seatblocks(row):\n    seatblocks = row['Seatblocks'].replace(':', ' ').split()\n    return pd.Series(seatblocks)\n\n# Apply the function to split and expand the 'Seatblocks' column\nexpanded_df = df.apply(split_seatblocks, axis=1)\n\n# Concatenate the original DataFrame with the expanded DataFrame\ndf_expanded = pd.concat([df.drop(columns=['Seatblocks']), expanded_df], axis=1)\n\n# Melt the DataFrame to get each part of the 'Seatblocks' in separate rows\ndf_melted = df_expanded.melt(id_vars=[col for col in df.columns if col != 'Seatblocks'], \n                             value_name='Seatblock', \n                             var_name='Seatblock_part')\n\n# Drop NA values and reset index\ndf_melted = df_melted.dropna().reset_index(drop=True)\n\n# Display the final DataFrame\nprint(df_melted)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`split_seatblocks` function**: This function replaces colons with spaces and splits the string into a list.\n- **`apply` method**: This applies the `split_seatblocks` function to each row, creating a DataFrame (`expanded_df`) where each part of the 'Seatblocks' is in a separate column.\n- **`concat` function**: This combines the original DataFrame (excluding the original 'Seatblocks' column) with the `expanded_df`.\n- **`melt` function**: This transforms the DataFrame so that each split part of 'Seatblocks' is in a separate row.\n- **`dropna` method**: This removes any rows where there are `NaN` values, which may occur if some cells had fewer splits.\n\nThis code should help you transform your DataFrame as needed, with each split part of the 'Seatblocks' column on a separate row. Adjust the file path and column names according to your specific CSV file."
