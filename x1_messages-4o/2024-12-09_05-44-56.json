For instance, I get the error \"E1101:125:get_user_tags: Class 'Tag' has no 'objects' member\" when I call \"Tag.objects.filter()\" in the following code:\n\n```python\ndef get_user_tags(username):\n   \"\"\"\n   Gets all the tags that username has used.\n   Returns a query set.\n   \"\"\"\n   return Tag.objects.filter(\n       tagownership__users__username__exact=username).distinct()\n\nclass Tag(models.Model):\n   \"\"\"\n   Model for user-defined strings that help categorize Events on\n   on a per-user basis.\n   \"\"\"\n   name = models.CharField(max_length=500, null=False, unique=True)\n\n   def __unicode__(self):\n       return self.name\n```\n\nHow can I adjust Pylint to properly consider fields such as 'objects'? I've looked into Django's source code, but I can't find the implementation of 'objects'. Suppressing all errors of type E1101 is not an acceptable solution for me. Is there another way to achieve this without modifying the Pylint source?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering with Pylint is due to the dynamic nature of Django's ORM, where attributes like `objects` are created at runtime. Because Pylint performs static analysis, it doesn't see these dynamically added attributes and therefore raises the E1101 error.\n\nHere are some solutions to address this issue without suppressing all E1101 errors or modifying Pylint's source code:\n\n1. **Use a Pylint Plugin for Django:**\n   There are specific Pylint plugins designed to handle Django's dynamic features. One such plugin is `pylint-django`. You can install it via pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pylint-django\n   ```\n\n   Then, you need to configure Pylint to use this plugin by adding it to your `.pylintrc` configuration file:\n\n   ```ini\n   [MASTER]\n   load-plugins=pylint_django\n   ```\n\n   This should help Pylint understand Django-specific attributes better.\n\n2. **Defining a Custom Pylint Configuration:**\n   If you want to handle specific cases without a plugin, you can use Pylint's configuration to ignore certain attributes for specific classes. You can do this by creating or modifying a `.pylintrc` file in your project directory:\n\n   ```ini\n   [TYPECHECK]\n   ignored-classes=Tag\n   ```\n\n   However, be cautious with this approach as it might hide legitimate errors.\n\n3. **Annotation in Code:**\n   You can also use a `# pylint: disable=E1101` comment to disable this specific error on a line-by-line basis. This is more targeted than disabling the error globally:\n\n   ```python\n   return Tag.objects.filter(  # pylint: disable=E1101\n       tagownership__users__username__exact=username).distinct()\n   ```\n\n4. **Configure Django in Pylint:**\n   Make sure that Pylint knows you're using Django. If you have a `manage.py` file in your project root, Pylint might automatically detect Django. Otherwise, ensure your `.pylintrc` or `pylint` command includes `--load-plugins=pylint_django`.\n\nBy using one or a combination of these methods, you should be able to reduce the false positives from Pylint while still benefiting from its static analysis capabilities."
