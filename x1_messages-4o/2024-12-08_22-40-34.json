        "content": "To find the dimensions of the rectangular garden, we can set up an equation based on the information given.\n\nLet the width of the garden be \\( w \\) meters. Then, the length of the garden is \\( w + 4 \\) meters. The area of the rectangle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\text{Length} \\times \\text{Width} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[ 48 = (w + 4) \\times w \\]\n\nExpanding the equation:\n\n\\[ 48 = w^2 + 4w \\]\n\nRearranging gives us a quadratic equation:\n\n\\[ w^2 + 4w - 48 = 0 \\]\n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can factor it:\n\n\\[ (w + 8)(w - 6) = 0 \\]\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives us the possible solutions for \\( w \\):\n\n\\[ w + 8 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad w = -8 \\] (not possible, since width cannot be negative)\n\n\\[ w - 6 = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad w = 6 \\]\n\nThus, the width of the garden is 6 meters. The length, being 4 meters more than the width, is:\n\n\\[ 6 + 4 = 10 \\] meters\n\nTherefore, the charming and lush garden has a width of 6 meters and a length of 10 meters, situated near a tranquil pond and surrounded by a quaint wooden fence."
