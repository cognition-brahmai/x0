Add the numbers for each letter in the title and multiply by the number of characters in the director's name. Then subtract the year the movie was released. What number do you get?

Convert each letter in \"The Matrix\" to its corresponding number:\n   - T = 20\n   - H = 8\n   - E = 5\n   - M = 13\n   - A = 1\n   - T = 20\n   - R = 18\n   - I = 9\n   - X = 24\n\n2. Add these numbers together:\n   \\( 20 + 8 + 5 + 13 + 1 + 20 + 18 + 9 + 24 = 118 \\)\n\n3. The directors of \"The Matrix\" are the Wachowskis. For this calculation, let's assume we're using one of their names, \"Lana Wachowski,\" which is 13 characters long.\n\n4. Multiply the sum by the number of characters in \"Lana Wachowski\":\n   \\( 118 \\times 13 = 1534 \\)\n\n5. Subtract the year the movie was released (1999):\n   \\( 1534 - 1999 = -465 \\)\n\nThe secret code to unlock the special bonus feature on the DVD is \\(-465\\)."
