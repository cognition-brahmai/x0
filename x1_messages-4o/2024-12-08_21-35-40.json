        "content": "To describe the trajectory of a domestic cat performing a vertical leap, we can model the cat's movement using the basic physics of projectile motion. Assuming the cat leaps with an initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) at an angle \\( \\theta \\) with respect to the horizontal, we can use the following equations to describe its motion. However, since the cat is jumping directly upward over a vertical obstacle, the angle \\( \\theta \\) would be 90 degrees, simplifying the equations.\n\nThe trajectory in a vertical leap can be described by considering only the vertical motion, as horizontal motion is negligible in this case. The equation for the vertical position \\( y \\) as a function of time \\( t \\) is given by:\n\n\\[ \ny(t) = v_0 t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \n\\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( y(t) \\) is the vertical position at time \\( t \\),\n- \\( v_0 \\) is the initial velocity at which the cat leaps upwards,\n- \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \\( 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\)).\n\nThe cat's maximum height \\( H \\) can be found when the vertical velocity becomes zero:\n\n\\[ \nH = \\frac{v_0^2}{2g} \n\\]\n\nSo, assuming the cat has enough energy to clear the obstacle, you can use these equations to model its leap over the vertical obstacle. Here's the relevant LaTeX code for the trajectory and maximum height equations:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\nThe trajectory of a cat's vertical leap can be modeled by the equation:\n\\[\ny(t) = v_0 t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2\n\\]\n\nThe maximum height \\( H \\) reached by the cat is given by:\n\\[\nH = \\frac{v_0^2}{2g}\n\\]\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nThis model assumes no air resistance and that the cat leaps vertically upwards, which simplifies the analysis to a one-dimensional problem."
