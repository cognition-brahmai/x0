I have an 'event' model and a location model as shown below:\n\n```python\nclass Location(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n\nclass Event(models.Model):\n    start_date = models.DateTimeField()\n    end_date = models.DateTimeField()\n    location = models.ForeignKeyField(Location)\n\n    objects = EventManager()\n```\n\nFor a given location, I want to select all events occurring today. I tried to use a 'bookings_today' method in the EventManager but I'm struggling to find the right filter syntax:\n\n```python\nclass EventManager(models.Manager):\n    def bookings_today(self, location_id):\n        bookings = self.filter(location=location_id, start=?, end=?)\n```\n\nUsing date() fails as it zeroes out the times, and time during the day is critical to the app. The same goes for min and max of the dates, and using them as bookends. Also, there are multiple possible valid configurations:\n\n```python\nstart_date < today, end_date during today\nstart_date during today, end_date during today\nstart_date during today, end_date after today\n```\n\nIs there a simple and elegant method to solve this issue or do I need to code a whole set of different options?"

        "content": "To filter events occurring today for a specific location in Django, you can use a combination of Django's QuerySet filtering capabilities and Python's `datetime` module to create the appropriate date and time range. The goal is to find events that meet any of the conditions you've mentioned.\n\nHere's a solution to achieve this with your `EventManager`:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, time\nfrom django.utils.timezone import make_aware, now\n\nclass EventManager(models.Manager):\n    def bookings_today(self, location_id):\n        # Get the current date and time\n        today = now().date()\n        \n        # Define the start and end of the current day\n        start_of_today = make_aware(datetime.combine(today, time.min))\n        end_of_today = make_aware(datetime.combine(today, time.max))\n        \n        # Filter events that fall into any of the specified conditions\n        bookings = self.filter(\n            location=location_id\n        ).filter(\n            # First condition: Events that started before today and end during today\n            (Q(start_date__lt=start_of_today) & Q(end_date__date=today)) |\n            # Second condition: Events that start during today and end during today\n            (Q(start_date__date=today) & Q(end_date__date=today)) |\n            # Third condition: Events that start during today and end after today\n            (Q(start_date__date=today) & Q(end_date__gt=end_of_today)) |\n            # Fourth condition: Events that started before today and end after today\n            (Q(start_date__lt=start_of_today) & Q(end_date__gt=end_of_today))\n        )\n        \n        return bookings\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Date and Time Range**: We first determine the start and end of the current day using `datetime.combine` with `time.min` and `time.max` to cover the entire day.\n\n2. **Timezone Awareness**: Using `make_aware` ensures that the datetime objects are timezone-aware, which is often necessary when working with Django.\n\n3. **Filter Conditions**: We apply multiple conditions using Django's `Q` objects to cover all the cases:\n   - Events that started before today and end today.\n   - Events that start and end today.\n   - Events that start today and end after today.\n   - Events that started before today and end after today (i.e., events spanning over multiple days including today).\n\nBy using these conditions, you can ensure that all events occurring today for a specified location are included in your query results.\n\nDon't forget to import `Q` from `django.db.models` if it's not already imported."
