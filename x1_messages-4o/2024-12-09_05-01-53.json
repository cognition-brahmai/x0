I can get '4321' using `foo[4:0:-1]` and '321' using `foo[3:0:-1]`, but I am unable to get '3210'. Is there a way to achieve this without creating two string objects as I need to perform this operation billions of times and each string operation is expensive?\n\nCode:\n```python\nfoo = '0123456'\nprint(foo[0:4])     # '0123'\nprint(foo[::-1])    # '6543210'\nprint(foo[4:0:-1])  # '4321'\nprint(foo[3:-1:-1]) # ''\nprint(foo[3:0:-1])  # '321'\n```"

        "content": "To achieve the desired output of '3210' using slicing, you can slightly adjust your slicing range. The key is to include the starting index in the range by setting it to `None` or leave it empty. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfoo = '0123456'\nresult = foo[3::-1]  # This will give you '3210'\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `foo[3::-1]` starts at index 3 ('3') and steps backward through the string until it reaches index 0 ('0'), inclusive.\n- By leaving the stop index empty, the slice will include the character at index 0.\n\nThis approach avoids the need to create multiple string objects, which can be beneficial in terms of performance when performing this operation numerous times."
