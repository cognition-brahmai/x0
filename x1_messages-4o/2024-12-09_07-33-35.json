Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n1. Use the `glob` method to find files with the desired extension.\n2. Extract the filename from each full path.\n\nHere's a code example that demonstrates how to do this:\n\n```python\nimport glob\nimport os\n\n# Specify the directory and the file extension\ndirectory = '/path/to/directory'  # replace with your directory path\nextension = '*.txt'               # replace with your file extension\n\n# Get the list of all files with the specified extension\nfile_paths = glob.glob(os.path.join(directory, extension))\n\n# Extract and print the filenames\nfilenames = [os.path.basename(file_path) for file_path in file_paths]\nfor filename in filenames:\n    print(filename)\n```\n\nIn this script:\n\n- We use `glob.glob` to retrieve all files matching the specified pattern (e.g., `*.txt`) in the given directory.\n- We then use `os.path.basename` to extract the filename from each file path.\n- Finally, we print out each filename.\n\nThis will give you a list of filenames with the specified extension in the directory, without the full path."
