You need to set up a regular task to clean up expired session data.\n\nTo manage this, you can use Django's `clearsessions` management command, which removes all expired sessions from the database. This command can be added to a periodic task scheduler like cron or a task queue like Celery to run at regular intervals.\n\nFor example, you can add a cron job to run daily:\n\n```bash\n0 0 * * * /path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/python /path/to/your/project/manage.py clearsessions\n```\n\nThis setup ensures that your session database table is regularly purged of expired sessions, keeping it optimized and efficient."
