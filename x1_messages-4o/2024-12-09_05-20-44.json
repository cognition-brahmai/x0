        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that there's an issue with the way the `pyPdf` module is trying to import its components. Here are a few steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify Installation:**\n   Ensure that the `pyPdf` module is correctly installed. You might want to try reinstalling it to ensure there were no issues during installation:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall pydf\n   pip install pypdf\n   ```\n\n   Note: The official package name is `PyPDF2` (formerly known as `pyPdf`), so verify you're installing the correct module version.\n\n2. **Use PyPDF2 Instead:**\n   The `pyPdf` library is outdated. Instead, use `PyPDF2`, which is a more actively maintained fork of `pyPdf`. Install it using:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install PyPDF2\n   ```\n\n   Then, you can import it using:\n\n   ```python\n   from PyPDF2 import PdfFileReader, PdfFileWriter\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify Python Path:**\n   Make sure your Python environment is set up correctly and the path to the installed packages is correct. You can check which packages are installed in your environment with:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip list\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for Conflicts:**\n   Sometimes other installed packages can cause conflicts. It might help to create a new virtual environment and install only the necessary packages:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\\Scripts\\activate`\n   pip install PyPDF2\n   ```\n\n5. **Review Import Statements:**\n   Double-check your import statements to ensure they match the new package structure if you've switched to `PyPDF2`.\n\nIf you follow these steps and the issue persists, please provide additional details about your Python version and any other relevant environment information."
