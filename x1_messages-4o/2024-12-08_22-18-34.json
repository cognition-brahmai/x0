The expressions should contain at least two words and use synonyms for the word \"tired\". Can you provide me with a SQL code to achieve this task?"

        "content": "To generate idiomatic expressions in English for the French phrase \"Je suis fatigu\u00e9\" using an SQL database, you'll first need a database that contains synonyms and idiomatic expressions. Since creating a comprehensive database for this task from scratch can be complex, let's assume you have a table structure that includes relevant data.\n\nHere's a basic outline of how you might set up your database and write an SQL query to get the desired results:\n\n### Database Setup\n\n1. **Synonyms Table**: This table contains synonyms for the word \"tired\".\n   - **Table Name**: `synonyms`\n   - **Columns**: `id`, `word`, `synonym`\n\n2. **Idiomatic Expressions Table**: This table includes idiomatic expressions and their meanings.\n   - **Table Name**: `idioms`\n   - **Columns**: `id`, `expression`, `meaning`\n\n### Sample Data\n\n- **Synonyms Table**:\n  ```\n  | id | word   | synonym  |\n  |----|--------|----------|\n  | 1  | tired  | exhausted|\n  | 2  | tired  | weary    |\n  | 3  | tired  | fatigued |\n  ```\n\n- **Idioms Table**:\n  ```\n  | id | expression                | meaning                        |\n  |----|---------------------------|--------------------------------|\n  | 1  | run down                  | very tired                     |\n  | 2  | dead on one's feet        | extremely tired                |\n  | 3  | worn out                  | very tired                     |\n  ```\n\n### SQL Query\n\nHere's an SQL query to find idiomatic expressions that relate to being tired, using synonyms:\n\n```sql\nSELECT i.expression\nFROM idioms i\nJOIN synonyms s ON i.meaning LIKE CONCAT('%', s.synonym, '%')\nWHERE s.word = 'tired';\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **JOIN Condition**: The query joins the `idioms` and `synonyms` tables on the condition that the `meaning` column in `idioms` contains the `synonym` from the `synonyms` table.\n- **WHERE Clause**: Filters synonyms that are alternatives for the word \"tired\".\n\nThis query assumes that the idioms' meanings are descriptive enough to include synonyms for \"tired\". You can adjust the database structure and query based on the actual data you have. \n\nIf you don't have a pre-existing database, consider populating it with relevant synonyms and idiomatic expressions manually or by using a data source that provides such linguistic information."
