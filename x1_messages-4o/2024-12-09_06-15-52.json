        "content": "I am having problems filtering a Django datetime field by month and day. When trying to filter the 'created' field of my 'clicks' queryset by month and day, I get an empty list as a result. However, filtering by year seems to work fine. I have tried different ways to filter by month, including using an integer, a zero-prefixed integer, a string, and a variable, but none of these attempts were successful. Furthermore, I have demonstrated that I get the same behavior before creating and dealing with a queryset. On the other hand, when I manually loop through all the objects in the queryset and increment a counter if the 'created' month is 2, I do get a count of 35. Why is my filter not working as expected?\n\nHere is the code and the results I get:\n\n```\n>>> clicks.count()\n36\n>>> date = clicks[0].created\n>>> date.month\n2\n>>> date.year\n2014\n>>> date.day\n1\n>>> clicks.filter(created__month=2)\n[]\n>>> clicks.filter(created__month=02)\n[]\n>>> clicks.filter(created__month='02')\n[]\n>>> clicks.filter(created__month='2')\n[]\n>>> clicks.filter(created__month=date.month)\n[]\n>>> clicks.filter(created__day=date.day)\n[]\n```\n\nAnd when filtering before creating a queryset:\n```\n>>> clicks = PreviewClick.objects.filter(created__month = 2)\n>>> clicks.count()\n0\n>>> clicks = PreviewClick.objects.filter(created__month = 02)\n>>> clicks.count()\n0\n>>> clicks = PreviewClick.objects.filter(created__month = '02')\n>>> clicks.count()\n0\n>>> clicks = PreviewClick.objects.filter(created__month = '2')\n>>> clicks.count()\n0\n```\n\nAnd when manually looping:\n```\n>>> clicks = PreviewClick.objects.all()\n>>> counter = 0\n>>> for click in clicks:\n...      if click.created.month == 2:\n...           counter += 1\n... \n>>> counter\n35\n```"

        "content": "The issue you\u2019re experiencing is likely related to how your database is interpreting the `__month` and `__day` lookups in Django. Here are a few things you can check and try:\n\n1. **Database Compatibility**: Ensure that the database you are using supports extracting month and day from a datetime field in the way Django is attempting to do it. Some databases might have different ways of handling date parts.\n\n2. **Time Zone Settings**: Make sure your `TIME_ZONE` settings in `settings.py` are consistent with the data stored in your database. If there is a mismatch, it might affect how datetime fields are queried.\n\n3. **Database Field Type**: Verify that the `created` field in your database is indeed a `DATETIME` field. If it\u2019s stored as a string or another type, the month and day lookups may not work as expected.\n\n4. **Django Version**: Ensure that you are using a compatible version of Django that supports these lookups with your database. There might be version-specific issues or bugs.\n\n5. **Database Backend**: If you're using a non-standard database backend or a custom one, ensure it correctly implements the `month` and `day` lookups.\n\n6. **Run Raw SQL**: Execute a raw SQL query to see if you can filter by month and day directly in the database. This will help determine if the issue is with Django or the database.\n\n7. **Check for ORM Bugs**: Sometimes there can be bugs in the ORM. Check Django\u2019s issue tracker for any related issues with the version you are using.\n\nHere's a small checklist to try:\n\n- Ensure your database supports the `EXTRACT` function (or equivalent) for pulling out date parts.\n- Double-check if there are any active database triggers or procedures that might affect how dates are stored or returned.\n- Test with other date fields or even with a fresh set of data to see if the issue persists.\n\nIf none of these solutions work, consider providing more information about your environment, such as the type of database you are using, the Django version, and any custom configurations you might have."
