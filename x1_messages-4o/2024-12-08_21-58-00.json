        "content": "**Differences between Synthetic and Natural Fibers:**\n\n1. **Origin:**\n   - **Synthetic Fibers:** These are man-made fibers produced from chemical substances. Common examples include polyester, nylon, and acrylic.\n   - **Natural Fibers:** These are derived from natural sources, either plants or animals, such as cotton, wool, silk, and linen.\n\n2. **Absorbency:**\n   - **Synthetic Fibers:** Generally less absorbent. They tend to wick moisture rather than absorb it, which can make them dry faster.\n   - **Natural Fibers:** Typically more absorbent, allowing them to retain moisture. This characteristic makes them more comfortable in hot and humid conditions.\n\n3. **Durability:**\n   - **Synthetic Fibers:** Usually more durable and resistant to wear and tear. They often have a longer lifespan compared to natural fibers.\n   - **Natural Fibers:** Tend to be less durable, can wear out faster, and may be more susceptible to damage from environmental factors like UV rays and pests.\n\n4. **Elasticity:**\n   - **Synthetic Fibers:** Generally have better elasticity, meaning they can stretch and return to their original shape more effectively.\n   - **Natural Fibers:** Often less elastic and can lose shape over time if stretched excessively.\n\n5. **Texture and Feel:**\n   - **Synthetic Fibers:** Can feel less soft and may be less comfortable against the skin compared to natural fibers. However, advancements in technology have improved their texture.\n   - **Natural Fibers:** Usually softer and more comfortable, often preferred for clothing that is in direct contact with the skin.\n\n6. **Environmental Impact:**\n   - **Synthetic Fibers:** Typically have a higher environmental impact due to the use of petrochemicals and non-biodegradable nature.\n   - **Natural Fibers:** Generally considered more environmentally friendly as they are biodegradable, though their farming and processing can also have significant environmental impacts.\n\n**JavaScript Code Demonstration:**\n\nTo demonstrate the difference in behavior when stretched, you can simulate this with a simple interaction like you've provided. Here's a small JavaScript code snippet that illustrates the concept:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Fiber Stretch Demo</title>\n    <style>\n        .fiber {\n            width: 100px;\n            height: 20px;\n            margin: 10px;\n            display: inline-block;\n            text-align: center;\n            line-height: 20px;\n            color: white;\n            cursor: pointer;\n        }\n        #synthetic-fiber {\n            background-color: blue;\n        }\n        #natural-fiber {\n            background-color: green;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<div id=\"synthetic-fiber\" class=\"fiber\">Synthetic Fiber</div>\n<div id=\"natural-fiber\" class=\"fiber\">Natural Fiber</div>\n\n<script>\n    const syntheticFiber = document.getElementById(\"synthetic-fiber\");\n    const naturalFiber = document.getElementById(\"natural-fiber\");\n\n    syntheticFiber.addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n        syntheticFiber.style.width = \"120px\"; // Less stretch\n        console.log(\"Synthetic fiber stretches less and is less absorbent than natural fiber.\");\n    });\n\n    naturalFiber.addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n        naturalFiber.style.width = \"150px\"; // More stretch\n        console.log(\"Natural fiber stretches more and is more absorbent than synthetic fiber.\");\n    });\n</script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nIn this demonstration, clicking on each fiber type visually shows the stretch effect by changing the width of the respective div element, reflecting the typical stretching behavior of synthetic and natural fibers."
