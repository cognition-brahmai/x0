When I try running \"pipenv install --upgrade numpy\", it tries to install both \"--upgrade\" and \"numpy\" instead of just upgrading the numpy package as it would with the --upgrade switch in pip. Is there a solution or workaround to this issue?"

However, you can still upgrade a package using pipenv by following these steps:\n\n1. **Uninstall the current package version**: First, you can uninstall the existing version of the package you want to upgrade. You can do this using the following command:\n   ```bash\n   pipenv uninstall numpy\n   ```\n\n2. **Reinstall the package**: After uninstalling, reinstall the package without specifying a version, so it pulls the latest available version:\n   ```bash\n   pipenv install numpy\n   ```\n\n3. **Update the Pipfile.lock**: Running the above command will update your `Pipfile.lock` to reflect the latest version of the package.\n\nAlternatively, if you know the specific version you want to upgrade to, you can directly specify the version:\n```bash\npipenv install numpy==<desired_version>\n```\n\nRemember, any changes made to the `Pipfile` or `Pipfile.lock` should be committed if you're using version control, so that your project's dependencies are consistent across different environments."
