        "content": "You can write a simple Java program to take a string as input from the user and then return its length. Here's a sample program to help you get started:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class StringLengthCalculator {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Create a Scanner object to read input from the user\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        // Prompt the user to enter a string\n        System.out.print(\"Enter a string: \");\n        String inputString = scanner.nextLine();\n\n        // Calculate the length of the string\n        int length = inputString.length();\n\n        // Display the length of the string\n        System.out.println(\"The length of the string is: \" + length);\n\n        // Close the scanner\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Import Scanner**: The program uses the `Scanner` class from the `java.util` package to read user input.\n\n2. **Prompt for Input**: It prompts the user to enter a string.\n\n3. **Calculate Length**: The `length()` method of the `String` class is used to calculate the length of the input string.\n\n4. **Display Result**: It prints the length of the string to the console.\n\n5. **Close Scanner**: The scanner is closed to prevent resource leaks.\n\nTo run this program, simply compile it using a Java compiler (e.g., `javac`) and run it with the Java runtime (e.g., `java`)."
