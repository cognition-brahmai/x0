I am working with images within page scans of historic documents and I am trying to remove the regions of a page scan that contain text lines. I have managed to transform an input image into a plot by measuring the aggregate pixel brightness for each row across the image, from top to bottom. Now, I need to identify the regions of the curve that have the regular undulating pattern one sees in the first and last thirds of the plot. I initially tried fitting a linear model to the whole 1D distribution but it failed. I am considering fitting a sine-wave to segments of the curve but I'm not sure if this is the best approach."

        "content": "To identify regions of a 1-dimensional distribution that exhibit a sine-like, undulating pattern, you can consider the following approach:\n\n1. **Preprocessing**: \n   - Normalize your data to ensure that it is in a consistent range.\n   - Apply a smoothing filter (e.g., Gaussian filter) to reduce noise while preserving the general shape of the curve.\n\n2. **Local Frequency Analysis**:\n   - Use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to analyze the frequency components of your curve. This will help you identify dominant frequencies that might correspond to the undulating patterns.\n   - Consider using a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) or a wavelet transform to perform a localized frequency analysis, which can identify frequency changes over different segments of your data.\n\n3. **Pattern Detection**:\n   - Divide your data into segments and fit a sine or cosine function to each segment. You can use nonlinear least squares fitting (e.g., `scipy.optimize.curve_fit`) to find the optimal parameters of the sine wave (amplitude, frequency, phase).\n   - Evaluate the goodness of fit for each segment using metrics like the R-squared value or the mean squared error. Segments with a high goodness of fit are likely to contain the undulating pattern.\n\n4. **Thresholding**:\n   - Define a threshold based on the fit quality metrics to decide which segments exhibit a sine-like pattern.\n   - You may also consider using a heuristic based on the amplitude and frequency parameters obtained from the fitting process, as these should be relatively consistent in regions with a sine-like pattern.\n\n5. **Visualization and Validation**:\n   - Plot the segments with detected patterns over the original distribution to visually verify the accuracy of your detection.\n   - If necessary, adjust your parameters and thresholds based on visual inspection and domain knowledge.\n\n6. **Iterative Refinement**:\n   - Use feedback from the initial results to refine your approach. You might need to adjust the segment size, smoothing parameters, or threshold values to improve detection accuracy.\n\nHere is a basic example of how you might implement sine wave fitting on segments of your distribution:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import curve_fit\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Example sine function\ndef sine_wave(x, amplitude, frequency, phase, offset):\n    return amplitude * np.sin(frequency * x + phase) + offset\n\n# Example data: replace this with your actual brightness data\nx_data = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000)  # x-axis data\ny_data = np.sin(x_data) + np.random.normal(0, 0.1, len(x_data))  # synthetic sine wave with noise\n\n# Parameters\nsegment_length = 100  # Length of each segment\nthreshold_goodness_of_fit = 0.9  # Example threshold\n\n# Iterate over segments and fit sine wave\nfor start in range(0, len(x_data), segment_length):\n    end = start + segment_length\n    if end > len(x_data):\n        break\n\n    x_segment = x_data[start:end]\n    y_segment = y_data[start:end]\n\n    # Fit sine wave\n    popt, _ = curve_fit(sine_wave, x_segment, y_segment, p0=[1, 1, 0, 0])\n\n    # Calculate goodness of fit (R-squared)\n    y_fit = sine_wave(x_segment, *popt)\n    residuals = y_segment - y_fit\n    ss_res = np.sum(residuals**2)\n    ss_tot = np.sum((y_segment - np.mean(y_segment))**2)\n    r_squared = 1 - (ss_res / ss_tot)\n\n    # Check if this segment fits well\n    if r_squared > threshold_goodness_of_fit:\n        plt.plot(x_segment, y_segment, label=f'Segment {start}-{end}')\n        plt.plot(x_segment, y_fit, linestyle='--', color='red')\n\nplt.xlabel('X')\nplt.ylabel('Brightness')\nplt.title('Detected Sine-like Patterns')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis code provides a basic approach to detect sine-like patterns. You can refine and adapt it to suit your specific data and requirements."
