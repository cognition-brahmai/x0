The following code works in Python 2, but when I try to run it in Python 3.2, I get a \"NameError: global name 'x' is not defined\" error. \n\n```python\nclass Foo:\n    x = 5\n    y = [x for i in range(1)]\n```\n\nEven trying `Foo.x` does not seem to work. Additionally, I have a slightly more complex example where I would traditionally use `apply()`, but it is not available in Python 3. Here is the code:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nclass StateDatabase:\n    State = namedtuple('State', ['name', 'capital'])\n    db = [State(*args) for args in [\n        ['Alabama', 'Montgomery'],\n        ['Alaska', 'Juneau'],\n        # ...\n    ]]\n```\n\nHow can I access class variables in these cases in Python 3?"

        "content": "In Python 3, list comprehensions have their own local scope, unlike Python 2 where they could access the surrounding scope directly. This change is the reason you're encountering the `NameError` when trying to access class variables directly within a list comprehension in a class definition.\n\nTo solve this issue, you can use a class method or a class-level function to perform the operation and access the class variables. Here\u2019s how you can modify your examples to work in Python 3:\n\n### Example 1: Accessing class variable `x`\n\n```python\nclass Foo:\n    x = 5\n    y = []\n\n    @classmethod\n    def initialize_y(cls):\n        cls.y = [cls.x for i in range(1)]\n\n# Initialize y after the class is created\nFoo.initialize_y()\n```\n\nThis approach uses a class method to initialize `y` after the class is defined. The `@classmethod` decorator allows you to access class variables using `cls`.\n\n### Example 2: Using `namedtuple` with class variables\n\n```python\nfrom collections import namedtuple\n\nclass StateDatabase:\n    State = namedtuple('State', ['name', 'capital'])\n    db = []\n\n    @classmethod\n    def initialize_db(cls):\n        cls.db = [cls.State(*args) for args in [\n            ['Alabama', 'Montgomery'],\n            ['Alaska', 'Juneau'],\n            # ...\n        ]]\n\n# Initialize db after the class is created\nStateDatabase.initialize_db()\n```\n\nSimilarly, this example uses a class method to initialize the `db` attribute. The class method `initialize_db` is called after the class definition to fill `db` with `State` instances.\n\nThese methods ensure that class variables are accessible within the list comprehensions by using `cls.variable_name`, which is the standard way to reference class attributes in a class method."
