I tried importing it from PIL using \"from PIL import Image\" but I get \"ImportError: No module named PIL\". I have successfully installed PIL using \"pip install pil\" and also installed xcode command line tools but it's still not working. I am using Mac OS X 10.9 and Python 2.7.6. The python is located in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python, /usr/bin/python, and /usr/local/bin/python. The name of the PIL is \"PIL\" and its version is 1.1.7. It is located in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/PIL. Can you guide me on how to solve this?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is likely due to the naming of the package and the way it's installed. The Python Imaging Library (PIL) has been succeeded by Pillow, which is a more actively maintained fork. It's recommended to use Pillow instead of the old PIL package.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to resolving your issue:\n\n1. **Uninstall PIL**: First, you'll want to uninstall the existing PIL package to avoid conflicts.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall pil\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Pillow**: Install Pillow, which is the modern replacement for PIL.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pillow\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify Installation**: Check that Pillow is correctly installed.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip show pillow\n   ```\n\n   This command should display information about the Pillow package if it's installed correctly.\n\n4. **Importing in Python**: Now, you should be able to import the Image module from Pillow without any issue.\n\n   ```python\n   from PIL import Image\n   ```\n\n5. **Check Python Path**: Ensure that you're using the correct Python interpreter where Pillow is installed. Sometimes, multiple Python installations can cause confusion. You can check your current Python path by running:\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   print(sys.executable)\n   ```\n\n   Make sure this path matches the one where you've installed Pillow.\n\n6. **Virtual Environment**: If you continue to have issues, consider using a virtual environment to manage your Python packages. This can help avoid conflicts between different package versions.\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux\n   # myenv\\Scripts\\activate  # On Windows\n   pip install pillow\n   ```\n\n7. **Re-test Your Script**: Try running your script again after making these changes.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the \"ImportError\" and successfully use the Image module from Pillow in your Python scripts. If you encounter any further issues, feel free to ask for more help!"
