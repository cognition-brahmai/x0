        "content": "The error you're encountering is likely due to the fact that the terminal or environment where you're trying to print the output does not support certain Unicode characters that are present in the HTML content. This is typically related to the default encoding that your system is using when trying to print the data.\n\nHere are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Specify a Parser for BeautifulSoup:**\n   Always specify a parser when creating a BeautifulSoup object. You can use `'html.parser'`, which is included in the Python standard library, or `'lxml'`, which is faster and requires an additional installation.\n\n   ```python\n   soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')\n   ```\n\n2. **Handle Encoding Properly:**\n   Ensure that you're decoding the HTML content properly. The `urllib` module doesn't automatically decode the content, so you might want to do it manually based on the website's encoding. \n\n   ```python\n   html = get.read().decode('utf-8', errors='ignore')\n   ```\n\n   Note: Replace `'utf-8'` with the appropriate encoding if the website uses a different one.\n\n3. **Use an Alternative Print Method:**\n   If you still face issues printing to the console, consider writing the output to a file using `utf-8` encoding and then viewing the file. This approach bypasses any terminal-related encoding issues.\n\n   ```python\n   with open('output.html', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n       f.write(str(soup))\n   ```\n\n4. **Change the Console Encoding (Windows Specific):**\n   If you're using Windows, you can change the console code page to UTF-8 by running the following command in your command prompt before executing your script:\n\n   ```bash\n   chcp 65001\n   ```\n\n5. **Suppress Encoding Errors:**\n   If you simply want to suppress the error, you can handle it by encoding the output with error handling. However, be aware that this might lead to loss of some characters.\n\n   ```python\n   print(soup.encode('utf-8', errors='ignore').decode('utf-8'))\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, your script should be able to handle the Unicode characters more gracefully and avoid the `UnicodeEncodeError`."
