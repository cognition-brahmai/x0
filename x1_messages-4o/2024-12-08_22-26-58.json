What other analogies can you come up with to help explain this concept?"

The guards are trained to recognize and respond to known threats, like enemy soldiers or siege equipment. However, somewhere in the castle, there's a secret tunnel that even the guards and the castle's inhabitants are unaware of. This tunnel leads directly into the heart of the castle.\n\nA zero-day attack is akin to an enemy discovering this hidden tunnel and using it to infiltrate the castle unnoticed. The castle's defenses are completely bypassed because the guards and security systems don't even know the tunnel exists, leaving the castle vulnerable to whatever the intruders might do once inside. \n\nJust like the castle's inhabitants need to find and block the tunnel as quickly as possible to prevent further breaches, software developers and security teams must identify and fix the vulnerabilities as soon as they become aware of them."
