This is a new issue for me and it's also appearing on my travis-ci builds which otherwise haven't been altered. I am wondering what could be causing this error. Does it suggest that my distribution is outdated? Or could it be pointing towards an incorrectly specified option in the setup.py file? Could there be a different reason for this?"

        "content": "The error message \"error: option --single-version-externally-managed not recognized\" typically arises due to compatibility issues between the `setuptools` version and the package being installed. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Upgrade setuptools and pip**: Sometimes, the error is due to older versions of `setuptools` or `pip`. You can upgrade them using the following commands:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade pip setuptools\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Setup.py**: If you have access to the `setup.py` file of the package you are trying to install, ensure that there are no incorrect options specified in it. However, this is less likely to be the issue unless you've modified the setup configuration yourself.\n\n3. **Ensure Compatibility**: Verify that the package you are trying to install is compatible with your current Python version and platform.\n\n4. **Travis-CI Specific Issues**: If the error is occurring in your Travis-CI build, ensure that the environment is up to date. You can add the following lines to your `.travis.yml` to upgrade `pip` and `setuptools` before installing your requirements:\n\n   ```yaml\n   before_install:\n     - python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools\n   ```\n\n5. **Virtual Environment**: If you're not already doing so, consider using a virtual environment to manage your Python packages. This can help isolate dependencies and minimize conflicts.\n\n6. **Check for Known Issues**: Look for any known issues related to the specific package or its dependencies on their respective GitHub repositories or community forums.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue or at least get a better understanding of what might be causing it. If the problem persists, consider reaching out to the maintainers of the package with details about the error and your environment setup."
