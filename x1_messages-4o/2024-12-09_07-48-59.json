        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to the absence of the `ncurses` library, which is a dependency for building the `readline` module. Here's a step-by-step guide to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Install `ncurses` Development Libraries**: You need to install the development package for `ncurses`. Depending on your Linux distribution, the command may vary:\n\n   - For Ubuntu/Debian-based systems, use:\n     ```bash\n     sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev\n     ```\n\n   - For Fedora/RHEL-based systems, use:\n     ```bash\n     sudo yum install ncurses-devel\n     ```\n\n2. **Reinstall `readline`**: Once you have installed the `ncurses` development libraries, try to reinstall the `readline` module using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install readline\n   ```\n\n3. **Check Python's `readline` Support**: If you're still facing issues, it might be worth ensuring that your Python installation is compiled with `readline` support. Sometimes, the `readline` library that comes with the OS isn't available when Python is being built. You can check this by running Python and trying to import readline:\n\n   ```python\n   import readline\n   ```\n\n   If you don't get any errors, then `readline` support is present.\n\n4. **Rebuild Python with `readline` Support** (if necessary): If `readline` is still not available, you might need to rebuild Python. Here's how you can do it:\n\n   - Ensure that both `readline` and `ncurses` development libraries are installed.\n   - Rebuild Python from source:\n     ```bash\n     ./configure --with-readline\n     make\n     sudo make install\n     ```\n\n5. **Verify the Installation**: After following the steps above, verify that IPython is working correctly without the readline warning.\n\nIf you follow these steps, it should resolve the issue with `readline` in your IPython installation."
