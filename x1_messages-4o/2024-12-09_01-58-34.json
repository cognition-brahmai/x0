        "content": "How can I increase the size of my plot figures when using the Seaborn package in Python? I am utilizing `sns.pairplot` to plot columns of a dataframe against one another. The code I'm using is as follows:\n\n```python\n%matplotlib inline\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize']=10,10\ncolumns=list(df.columns.values)\ng=sns.pairplot(df, kind='reg', x_vars=columns,y_vars = ['Column 1'])\n```\nThe plots are showing correctly with the data, but the figure size is too small. I assumed `plot.rCParams['figure.figsize']` would control the size of the figure, however, it doesn't seem to be effective. I've attempted various solutions suggested online, but nothing seems to help."

        "content": "When using Seaborn's `sns.pairplot`, the `plt.rcParams['figure.figsize']` won't affect the size of the pairplot generated, as `pairplot` manages its own figure size internally. However, you can adjust the size of the plots using the `height` parameter within the `pairplot` function. The `height` parameter controls the height (and width, since the plots are square) of each facet.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to increase the size of the plot figures:\n\n```python\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Set the height of each plot facet (default is 2.5)\ng = sns.pairplot(df, kind='reg', x_vars=columns, y_vars=['Column 1'], height=3)\n\n# Optional: Adjust the aspect ratio if needed (aspect=1 for square facets)\ng.fig.set_size_inches(12, 12)  # Set the overall figure size if you want to ensure total coverage\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this example, setting `height=3` will increase each subplot in the pairplot, and you can adjust the number to your preference (e.g., 3.5, 4, etc.). Additionally, you can use `g.fig.set_size_inches()` to control the overall figure size if you need more precise adjustments.\n\nTry experimenting with different values for the `height` parameter to get the desired figure size."
