My dataset has a shape of 2000x14, where the first 13 elements form the input vector and the 14th element is the corresponding label. I am facing an issue where during the model training, the loss sometimes increases within the same epoch, leading to unstable learning. The accuracy also hits a plateau around 70%, despite tuning the learning rate and other hyperparameters. For reference, I have hardcoded a fully-connected feed forward neural net that reaches around 80-85% accuracy on the same problem. I've included the code for my current model below. Can you help me understand what could be causing these oscillations in learning in such a simple model?\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.python.keras.layers.core import Dense\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef normalize(array):\n    return array/np.linalg.norm(array, ord=2, axis=1, keepdims=True)\n\nx_train = pd.read_csv('data/labeled.csv', sep='\\s+').iloc[:1800, :-1].values\ny_train = pd.read_csv('data/labeled.csv', sep='\\s+').iloc[:1800, -1:].values\n\nx_test = pd.read_csv('data/labeled.csv', sep='\\s+').iloc[1800:, :-1].values\ny_test = pd.read_csv('data/labeled.csv', sep='\\s+').iloc[1800:, -1:].values\n\nx_train = normalize(x_train)\nx_test = normalize(x_test)\n\nmodel = tf.keras.Sequential()\nmodel.add(Dense(9, input_dim=13, activation=tf.nn.sigmoid))\nmodel.add(Dense(6, activation=tf.nn.sigmoid))\nmodel.add(Dense(1, activation=tf.nn.sigmoid))\n\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam',\n              loss='binary_crossentropy',\n              metrics=['accuracy'])\n\nmodel.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=50)\nmodel.evaluate(x_test, y_test)\n```\n\nAfter following some suggestions, I have modified the model as shown below:\n\n```python\nmodel = tf.keras.Sequential()\nmodel.add(Dense(250, input_dim=13, activation=tf.nn.relu))\nmodel.add(Dropout(0.4))\nmodel.add(Dense(200, activation=tf.nn.relu))\nmodel.add(Dropout(0.4))\nmodel.add(Dense(100, activation=tf.nn.relu))\nmodel.add(Dropout(0.3))\nmodel.add(Dense(50, activation=tf.nn.relu))\nmodel.add(Dense(1, activation=tf.nn.sigmoid))\n\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adadelta',\n              loss='binary_crossentropy',\n              metrics=['accuracy'])\n```"

        "content": "It looks like you've made some significant changes to your model architecture and optimizer, but you're still facing challenges with training stability and accuracy. Let's go through a few potential issues and suggestions to help you improve your model's performance:\n\n1. **Normalization**: Ensure that your normalization is working as expected. The function you've used normalizes each row independently, which is good for maintaining the scale of individual examples. However, consider using `StandardScaler` from `sklearn` to normalize your features to have zero mean and unit variance, which is often effective for neural networks.\n\n    ```python\n    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n\n    scaler = StandardScaler()\n    x_train = scaler.fit_transform(x_train)\n    x_test = scaler.transform(x_test)\n    ```\n\n2. **Optimizer**: You've switched from `adam` to `adadelta`. While `adadelta` can work well in some cases, it might not be as effective as `adam` for your dataset. Consider switching back to `adam` and experimenting with different learning rates. The default learning rate for `adam` is 0.001, but you might try values like 0.0001 or 0.01 to see if they help.\n\n3. **Batch Size**: If you're using a large batch size, try reducing it. Smaller batch sizes can help with generalization and may stabilize training. You could try a batch size of 32 or 64.\n\n4. **Dropout Rate**: Dropout is useful for regularization, but too much dropout can lead to underfitting. Consider reducing the dropout rates to 0.2 or 0.3 if they are too high.\n\n5. **Learning Rate Schedules**: Implement learning rate schedules or callbacks to dynamically adjust the learning rate during training. The `ReduceLROnPlateau` callback can be helpful:\n\n    ```python\n    callback = tf.keras.callbacks.ReduceLROnPlateau(monitor='val_loss', factor=0.1, patience=5, min_lr=0.00001)\n    ```\n\n    You can include this in your `fit` method:\n\n    ```python\n    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=50, validation_data=(x_test, y_test), callbacks=[callback])\n    ```\n\n6. **Model Complexity**: You increased the complexity of your model significantly. If your dataset is relatively small (as it seems to be), a simpler model might perform better. Try reducing the number of neurons or layers to see if it helps in avoiding overfitting.\n\n7. **Class Imbalance**: Check if your dataset has a class imbalance issue. If it does, you may need to use techniques like class weights or oversampling the minority class to address it.\n\n8. **Early Stopping**: Consider using early stopping to prevent overfitting. This will stop training when the validation loss stops improving:\n\n    ```python\n    early_stopping = tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=10, restore_best_weights=True)\n    ```\n\n    Include this in your `fit` method:\n\n    ```python\n    model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=50, validation_data=(x_test, y_test), callbacks=[callback, early_stopping])\n    ```\n\nExperiment with these suggestions, and monitor your validation accuracy and loss. It may take a few iterations to find the right combination of hyperparameters and model architecture that works best for your problem."
