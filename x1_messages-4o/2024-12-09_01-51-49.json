I am working with a file `a/b/c.py` which would be called with `python -m a.b.c`, and I want to obtain the value `a.b.c` at the module level. I am attempting to use this value in a `USAGE` string, so that when I receive the `-h` option, the `USAGE` can be displayed without the need to manually write down the actual value in each script. Is there a simple way to do this without the need for using `inspect`, `traceback`, or manipulating `__file__` and `__package__`? I've also tried using `__name__`, but it always returns `__main__`. I am using Python 2.6 and cannot use any other versions."

        "content": "In Python 2.6, when a module is run using the `-m` option, the `__name__` attribute is set to `__main__`, which makes it challenging to directly obtain the module's import path. However, you can work around this limitation by accessing the `sys.modules` dictionary, which contains all the loaded modules.\n\nHere's a method you can use to obtain the desired module path:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef get_module_name():\n    for module_name, module in sys.modules.items():\n        if module is not None and hasattr(module, '__file__'):\n            if module.__file__.endswith('c.py'):\n                return module_name\n    return None\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    module_name = get_module_name()\n    USAGE = \"Usage: python -m {}\".format(module_name if module_name else 'a.b.c')\n    print(USAGE)\n```\n\nThis function iterates over the `sys.modules` dictionary and checks for modules whose `__file__` attribute matches your script's filename (`c.py`). When it finds a match, it returns the module name, which is the key in the `sys.modules` dictionary. This should give you the module path `a.b.c` when the script is executed using `python -m a.b.c`.\n\nKeep in mind that this approach is a workaround for Python 2.6, and in newer versions of Python, there are more straightforward ways to achieve this."
