The line of code I am using is `from .basic import BasicModule`. However, I am getting a `ValueError: Attempted relative import in non-package` when I run `python extended.py`. I have also tried adding `from __future__ import absolute_import` to my code, but this does not solve the problem. Both the `basic.py` and `extended.py` modules are in the same directory and there is an `__init__.py` file present. Can you help me understand why this error is occurring and how I can resolve it?"

        "content": "The `ValueError: Attempted relative import in non-package` error occurs because Python's relative imports are intended to be used within a package context, and running a module directly (e.g., `python extended.py`) makes it the top-level script, not part of a package. Here's how you can resolve the issue:\n\n### Solutions:\n\n1. **Use Absolute Imports:**\n   Instead of using relative imports, you can use absolute imports. This involves specifying the full path of the module as if you were importing it from the package level.\n\n   ```python\n   # In extended.py\n   from basic import BasicModule\n   ```\n\n   This assumes that `basic.py` is a sibling to `extended.py` in the same directory.\n\n2. **Execute as a Module:**\n   Run the script using the `-m` switch to execute the directory as a package. Navigate to the parent directory of your package and run:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m your_package_name.extended\n   ```\n\n   This approach treats your directory as a package and allows the relative import to work correctly.\n\n3. **Reorganize Code to Use a `main` File:**\n   Create a separate script (e.g., `main.py`) that imports and runs your `extended` module. This way, you don't run the module directly.\n\n   ```python\n   # main.py\n   from your_package_name.extended import some_function_or_class\n   ```\n\n   Then, run `main.py` instead of `extended.py`.\n\n### Example Directory Structure:\n\nAssuming your directory structure looks like this:\n\n```\nyour_project/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 your_package_name/\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 basic.py\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 extended.py\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.py\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Relative Imports**: They only work when the script is executed as part of a package, not as a top-level script. Using `-m` or a `main.py` file helps maintain the package context.\n- **Absolute Imports**: They reference the module using the full path and are more straightforward for scripts meant to be run directly.\n\nBy following one of these solutions, you should be able to resolve the `ValueError` and import your modules correctly."
