I am trying to automate a migration from Windows XP to Windows 7 and my PowerShell script gives updates about the process. I want these updates to be printed as output from my Python script. I tried using `subprocess.call()` and `subprocess.Popen()`, but neither are giving me the desired results. I get an error `AttributeError: DebugOutput instance has no attribute 'fileno'`. I also tried using `stdout=subprocess.PIPE` but it also does not print the output. When I use `print p.communicate`, it gives me `<bound method Popen.communicate of <subprocess.Popen object at 0x00000000026E4A90>>`, not the \"Hello World\" I was expecting.\n\nHere is the PowerShell script I am using:\n```\n$strString = \"Hello World\"\nwrite-host $strString\n\nfunction ftest{\n$test = \"Test\"\nwrite-host $test\n}\n```\n\nI attempted to upgrade to Python 3.3 as suggested in one answer but I still can't get it to work. I used the command `p = subprocess.Popen(['powershell.exe', \"C:\\\\Users\\\\gu2124\\\\Desktop\\\\helloworld.ps1\"], stdout=sys.stdout)` and I am sure the file is there, but I am getting an error `UnsupportedOperation: fileno`."

        "content": "To run a PowerShell script from Python and capture the output in real-time, you can use the `subprocess` module with `Popen` and `communicate`. However, you need to handle the output correctly to avoid the `UnsupportedOperation: fileno` error. The key is to properly redirect the standard output and standard error streams so you can capture and print them in real-time.\n\nHere is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. Use `Popen` to execute the PowerShell script.\n2. Redirect the output using `stdout=subprocess.PIPE` and `stderr=subprocess.PIPE`.\n3. Use a loop to read the output line by line and print it in real-time.\n\nHere's a sample Python script:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\ndef run_powershell_script(script_path):\n    # Open the PowerShell process\n    process = subprocess.Popen(\n        ['powershell.exe', '-ExecutionPolicy', 'Bypass', '-File', script_path],\n        stdout=subprocess.PIPE,\n        stderr=subprocess.PIPE,\n        text=True,  # Ensure the output is treated as text\n        bufsize=1,  # Line-buffered\n    )\n\n    # Read and print the output line by line\n    for line in process.stdout:\n        print(line, end='')  # Print each line as it is received\n\n    # Read and print the error output, if any\n    for line in process.stderr:\n        print(line, end='')\n\n    # Wait for the process to complete and get the exit code\n    return_code = process.wait()\n    if return_code != 0:\n        print(f\"Script exited with return code: {return_code}\")\n\n# Path to your PowerShell script\nscript_path = r\"C:\\Users\\gu2124\\Desktop\\helloworld.ps1\"\n\n# Run the script\nrun_powershell_script(script_path)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- Use `text=True` to ensure that the output is treated as text rather than bytes.\n- Use `bufsize=1` to enable line buffering, which helps in getting the output in real-time.\n- Loop over `process.stdout` and `process.stderr` to read and print the output line by line.\n- Ensure that PowerShell execution policy allows the script to run (`-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`).\n\nThis approach should allow you to see the PowerShell script's output in real-time as it runs from within your Python script. Adjust the `script_path` variable to point to the correct location of your PowerShell script."
