        "content": "Certainly! To improve the efficiency of the `contains_elements` function, you can consider leveraging data structures that offer faster membership tests. Here\u2019s a more efficient approach using sets:\n\n### Current Approach (Assumed)\nIf your current implementation is using nested loops to check for each element, it might look something like this:\n\n```python\ndef contains_elements(lst, target):\n    for element in target:\n        if element not in lst:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\n### More Efficient Approach\nUsing sets can greatly improve the efficiency because checking membership in a set is average O(1) time complexity, compared to O(n) for a list.\n\n```python\ndef contains_elements(lst, target):\n    # Convert the list to a set for O(1) average time complexity checks\n    set_lst = set(lst)\n    \n    # Check if all elements of target are in the set of lst\n    return all(element in set_lst for element in target)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Set Conversion**: Convert `lst` to a set, `set_lst`. This allows for fast membership testing.\n2. **Membership Test**: Use a generator expression with the `all()` function to check if every element in `target` is in `set_lst`. This stops and returns `False` immediately upon finding the first missing element, making it efficient.\n\n### Considerations\n- **Space Complexity**: This approach uses additional space to store `set_lst`.\n- **Mutable Elements**: Ensure that the elements of `lst` are hashable, as required by sets.\n\nThis should improve the efficiency of your function, especially for larger lists."
