We can achieve this by creating a subquery that counts the number of unique items each customer has purchased. Here's an example code:\nSELECT DISTINCT customer.name, purchase.date, item.name\nFROM customer\nJOIN purchase ON customer.customer_id = purchase.customer_id\nJOIN item ON purchase.item_id = item.item_id\nJOIN sale ON sale.purchase_id = purchase.purchase_id\nWHERE sale.price IN (\n    SELECT price\n    FROM sale\n    WHERE customer_id IN (\n        SELECT customer_id\n        FROM purchase\n        GROUP BY customer_id\n        HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT item_id) >= 2 AND SUM(price) > 1000\n    )\n)\nORDER BY purchase.date ASC;\n// Execute query using database connection\nlet results = connection.execute(query)\n// Process results to retrieve the names of all customers who have made purchases of multiple items with a total price over $1000 at the same time."

        "content": "To achieve the desired result of retrieving the names of all customers who have made purchases of multiple items with a total price over $1000 at the same time, you can modify the SQL query as follows. The key is to ensure that the subquery correctly aggregates the purchases per transaction (assuming \"at the same time\" refers to a single purchase date or transaction):\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT customer.name\nFROM customer\nJOIN purchase ON customer.customer_id = purchase.customer_id\nJOIN sale ON sale.purchase_id = purchase.purchase_id\nWHERE purchase.purchase_id IN (\n    SELECT purchase_id\n    FROM (\n        SELECT purchase_id, customer_id, SUM(price) AS total_price, COUNT(DISTINCT item_id) AS item_count\n        FROM purchase\n        JOIN sale ON sale.purchase_id = purchase.purchase_id\n        GROUP BY purchase_id, customer_id\n        HAVING item_count >= 2 AND total_price > 1000\n    ) AS subquery\n)\nORDER BY customer.name ASC;\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Subquery**: The subquery aggregates data by `purchase_id` and `customer_id` to calculate the total price and count of distinct items for each purchase.\n2. **HAVING Clause**: It filters the results to include only those purchases where the count of distinct items is 2 or more and the total price exceeds $1000.\n3. **Main Query**: The main query selects distinct customer names whose purchase IDs meet the criteria specified in the subquery.\n4. **Ordering**: The results are ordered by the customer's name for readability.\n\nThis query structure ensures you capture transactions where customers have bought multiple items totaling over $1000 at once. Adjust the column names and table relations as necessary to fit your specific database schema."
