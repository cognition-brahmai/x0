For example, given the following stopwords and query:\n\n```python\nstopwords=['what','who','is','a','at','is','he']\nquery='What is hello'\n```\n\nI want to remove 'What' and 'is' from the query. However, when I use the following code:\n\n```python\nfor word in stopwords:\n    if word in query:\n        print word\n        query=query.replace(word,\"\")\n```\n\nIt also removes 'a' and 'at', resulting in the output 'wht s llo' for the input 'What is Hello'. Why is this happening and how can I correct it?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering arises because the `replace` method is removing any occurrence of the stopwords in the query string, including parts of words. For example, the stopword 'a' is being found and replaced in 'What', and 'at' is being found and replaced within the same word, altering it unexpectedly.\n\nTo fix this, you can split the query string into individual words and then filter out any words that are in the stopwords list. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nstopwords = ['what', 'who', 'is', 'a', 'at', 'is', 'he']\nquery = 'What is hello'\n\n# Convert the query to lowercase to handle case sensitivity\nquery_words = query.lower().split()\n\n# Filter out the stopwords\nfiltered_query = ' '.join(word for word in query_words if word not in stopwords)\n\nprint(filtered_query)\n```\n\nThis code converts the query to lowercase to ensure it matches the stopwords, splits the query into individual words, and filters out any words that are in the stopwords list. Finally, it joins the remaining words back into a string. The output will be:\n\n```\nhello\n```\n\nThis way, only complete words that match the stopwords are removed, preventing unintended removal of characters from within other words."
