Additionally, please use at least three metaphors or similes to describe the house and its memories. \nOnce I had a house,\nA symphony of laughter and tears\nWhere I made a thousand memories,\nEach one a chapter in my life's book\nIt served me well,\nA loyal friend through every storm\nBut now I'm gone,\nLeaving behind a masterpiece of my past,\nA museum of my heart's treasures."
