        "content": "Certainly! Let\u2019s break this down into two parts: identifying some lesser-known Italian filmmakers who have made a significant impact, and then modifying the Swift code to retrieve information about them using an API like the Open Movie Database (OMDb).\n\n### Lesser-Known Italian Filmmakers\n\n1. **Valerio Zurlini**: Known for his introspective and melancholic films, Zurlini's works often explore themes of love and loss.\n\n2. **Pietro Germi**: While not completely unknown, Germi's contribution to Italian cinema, especially through films like \"Divorce Italian Style,\" showcases his satirical take on Italian society.\n\n3. **Elio Petri**: Known for his politically charged films, Petri\u2019s work often delves into themes of power and corruption.\n\n4. **Marco Bellocchio**: Renowned for his bold storytelling and exploration of personal and political themes.\n\n5. **Alice Rohrwacher**: A contemporary filmmaker, Rohrwacher is known for her unique narrative style and has already made a significant impact with films like \"The Wonders.\"\n\n### Modifying the Swift Code\n\nTo retrieve information specifically about these filmmakers, you might want to search for movies by their name instead of a general search for Italian films. Here's how you could modify the code:\n\n```swift\nstruct SearchResult: Codable {\n    let Title: String\n    let Year: String\n    let imdbID: String\n    let Type: String\n    let Poster: String\n}\n\nstruct SearchResults: Codable {\n    let Search: [SearchResult]\n}\n\nlet filmmakers = [\"Valerio Zurlini\", \"Pietro Germi\", \"Elio Petri\", \"Marco Bellocchio\", \"Alice Rohrwacher\"]\nlet apiKey = \"12345\" // Replace with your actual API key\n\nfor filmmaker in filmmakers {\n    let query = filmmaker.addingPercentEncoding(withAllowedCharacters: .urlQueryAllowed) ?? \"\"\n    let url = URL(string: \"http://www.omdbapi.com/?s=\\(query)&apikey=\\(apiKey)\")!\n    \n    let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { (data, response, error) in\n        guard let data = data else {\n            print(\"Failed to get data for \\(filmmaker)\")\n            return\n        }\n        do {\n            let result = try JSONDecoder().decode(SearchResults.self, from: data)\n            print(\"Movies by \\(filmmaker):\")\n            for movie in result.Search {\n                print(\"- \\(movie.Title) (\\(movie.Year))\")\n            }\n        } catch let error {\n            print(\"Error decoding data for \\(filmmaker): \\(error)\")\n        }\n    }\n    task.resume()\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Structs**: I've defined `SearchResult` and `SearchResults` structs to map the JSON response.\n2. **Filmmaker Loop**: The code iterates over a list of filmmaker names, encodes them for URL use, and makes a request for each.\n3. **Decoding**: It decodes the JSON response using `JSONDecoder` and prints out the titles and years of the movies associated with each filmmaker.\n\nThis setup should help you retrieve and print information about films by these lesser-known Italian filmmakers. Remember to replace `\"12345\"` with your actual OMDb API key."
