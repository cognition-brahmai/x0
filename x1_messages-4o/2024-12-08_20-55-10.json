Your task is to determine the slope of this line, which can be done by computing the ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal change. However, to make it more challenging, we also want you to calculate the angular coefficient of the line using this slope value. This process requires both analytical and mathematical skills, so put on your thinking cap!"

The slope \\( m \\) is determined by the formula:\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the given coordinates into the formula:\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{-2 - (-3)}{1 - 2} = \\frac{-2 + 3}{1 - 2} = \\frac{1}{-1} = -1\n\\]\n\nThe slope of the line is \\(-1\\).\n\nNext, we calculate the angular coefficient, which is simply another term for the slope of the line in this context. Therefore, the angular coefficient is also \\(-1\\).\n\nThus, the slope and the angular coefficient of the line are both \\(-1\\)."
