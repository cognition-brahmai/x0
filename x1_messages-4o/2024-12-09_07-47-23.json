However, now sets are ordered and pop always removes from the start. I'm not sure how I feel about using set.remove(random.sample(set, 1)[0]). Can you suggest a better way?"

        "content": "In Python 3.6 and later, sets maintain insertion order as an implementation detail (officially guaranteed from Python 3.7 onward), which means that using `set.pop()` will indeed always remove and return the first element in the set. If you want to pop a random element from a set, you can use the `random.choice()` function in combination with `list()` conversion, although this might not be the most efficient method due to the conversion overhead. However, it provides a straightforward solution:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef pop_random_element(s):\n    if not s:\n        raise KeyError(\"pop from an empty set\")\n    elem = random.choice(list(s))\n    s.remove(elem)\n    return elem\n\n# Example usage:\nmy_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nrandom_element = pop_random_element(my_set)\nprint(random_element)\n```\n\nThis approach converts the set to a list to use `random.choice()`, which randomly selects an element. The selected element is then removed from the set. While this method may not be the most performance-efficient for very large sets due to the list conversion, it is a simple way to achieve random popping of elements."
