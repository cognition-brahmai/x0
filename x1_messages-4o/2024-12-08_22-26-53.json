        "content": "Data manipulation involves various tasks that transform raw data into a more useful format or extract meaningful insights. Common types of data manipulation tasks include:\n\n1. **Data Cleaning:** This involves identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies in data to improve its quality. Tasks include handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors in data entries.\n\n2. **Filtering:** This task involves selecting a subset of data based on specific criteria. It helps in focusing on relevant data for analysis.\n\n3. **Sorting:** Organizing data in a certain order, such as ascending or descending, based on one or more columns.\n\n4. **Aggregation:** Combining multiple pieces of data into a summary form. Common aggregation functions include sum, average, count, min, and max.\n\n5. **Transformation:** Changing the format or structure of data. This could include converting data types, normalizing data, or creating new calculated columns.\n\n6. **Merging/Joining:** Combining data from different sources or tables based on a common key or set of keys.\n\n7. **Pivoting/Unpivoting:** Reshaping data from a long format to a wide format (pivoting) or vice versa (unpivoting), often used in data analysis to better understand relationships.\n\n8. **Resampling:** Changing the frequency of time series data, such as converting daily data to monthly data.\n\n9. **Text Manipulation:** Involves tasks like extracting substrings, replacing text, or parsing strings to extract data.\n\n10. **Encoding and Decoding:** Converting categorical data into numerical format (encoding) for use in machine learning models, and reversing the process (decoding).\n\nThese tasks are crucial in preparing data for analysis, ensuring that it is in the right format, and that insights derived from it are accurate and meaningful."
