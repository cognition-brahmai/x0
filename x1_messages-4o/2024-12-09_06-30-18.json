I have written this code:\n\n```python\n#open file for reading\nfn = input(\"Enter file to open: \")\nfh = open(fn,'r')\n# if file does not exist, create it\nif (!fh) \nfh = open ( fh, \"w\")\n```\n\nBut I am getting an error on the line `if(!fh)`. Can I use `exist` similar to Perl to check if the file exists?"

Instead, you should handle this using a `try-except` block to catch the `FileNotFoundError` exception. Here\u2019s how you can modify your code to open a file for reading, and if it does not exist, create it and open it for writing:\n\n```python\nfn = input(\"Enter file to open: \")\n\ntry:\n    # Try to open the file for reading\n    fh = open(fn, 'r')\n    print(\"File opened for reading.\")\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    # If the file does not exist, open it for writing, which will create the file\n    fh = open(fn, 'w')\n    print(\"File not found. Creating and opening file for writing.\")\n```\n\nThis code will first try to open the file in read mode. If the file does not exist, it will catch the `FileNotFoundError` and then open the file in write mode, which will create the file if it doesn't exist."
