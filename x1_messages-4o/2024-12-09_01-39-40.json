Furthermore, it doesn't seem to load properly. I have to manually click the Refresh button several times on the right side of the list and toggle the on/off button on the left side of the list to be able to schedule the DAG. What could be the issue here? There's also an indicator message \"This DAG isn't available in the webserver DagBag object. It shows up in this list because the scheduler marked it as active in the metadata database\" tagged with the DAG title before I can trigger this manual process. Is there something I am missing or is this the correct behavior in Airflow?"

        "content": "The behavior you're experiencing isn't typical, and it seems like there might be a couple of issues at play here. Normally, when you place a DAG file in the `dags` folder, Airflow should automatically detect it and it should appear as enabled in the UI without requiring manual intervention. Here are a few things you can check to troubleshoot this issue:\n\n1. **DAG Syntax and File Name**: \n   - Ensure that your DAG file has a `.py` extension and is correctly formatted.\n   - Check for any syntax errors in the DAG file. Even minor errors can prevent the DAG from being parsed correctly.\n\n2. **Airflow Configuration**:\n   - Verify that your Airflow configuration (`airflow.cfg`) is correctly set up, especially the `dags_folder` path.\n   - Ensure that the `load_examples` parameter is set to `False` if you are working in a production environment, as loading example DAGs can sometimes cause issues.\n\n3. **Scheduler and Webserver**:\n   - Confirm that both the Airflow scheduler and webserver are running properly. The scheduler is responsible for parsing DAGs and might not be processing them if it's not running.\n   - Check the logs for both the scheduler and webserver for any errors or warnings that might provide clues.\n\n4. **Database Issues**:\n   - Since Airflow uses a metadata database, ensure that your database is running smoothly and is not encountering any connection issues.\n   - You might want to run `airflow db check` to ensure that your database is properly initialized and accessible.\n\n5. **DagBag Loading**:\n   - The message \"This DAG isn't available in the webserver DagBag object\" suggests that the webserver's DagBag might not be loading the DAG properly. This could be due to a large number of DAGs or a resource constraint. Consider increasing resources or optimizing your DAG parsing logic.\n   - Try restarting both the scheduler and the webserver to force them to reload the DAGs.\n\n6. **Check Airflow Version**:\n   - Ensure you are using a stable version of Airflow. If you are using a newer release or a development version, it might contain bugs that affect DAG loading.\n\n7. **DAG Import Errors**:\n   - If there are import errors in your DAG file, they will prevent the DAG from being loaded properly. Check the Airflow UI under \"Browse\" -> \"DAGs\" -> \"Import Errors\" for any issues.\n\nIf none of these solutions resolve the issue, consider reaching out to the Airflow community or checking the Airflow issue tracker for similar problems."
