        "content": "This is an intriguing puzzle! Let's break it down:\n\n1. We need to identify three books where the protagonist, antagonist, and a supporting character respectively have the same letter as their middle initial.\n\nTo solve this, consider some well-known classic books:\n\n- **Protagonist in the first book**: Jay Gatsby from \"The Great Gatsby.\" His middle initial is G.\n  \n- **Antagonist in the second book**: Tom Buchanan from \"The Great Gatsby.\" His character is often seen as the antagonist and also has the middle initial G.\n  \n- **Supporting character in the third book**: Jordan Baker from \"The Great Gatsby.\" She is a supporting character and her name includes the letter G.\n\nThese books share the characteristic that the characters' names include the letter G as a significant initial or component. However, if you're looking for a different configuration or other books, you may need to explore other classic literature with similar naming patterns."
