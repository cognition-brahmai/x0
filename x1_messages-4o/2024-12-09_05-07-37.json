In account B, I have a role (Role-B) defined that allows access from another role in account A (Role-A). Role-A is defined in account A and allows the root user to assume the role. As a user in account A, I assumed Role-A. Now using these temporary credentials, I want to assume Role-B and access the resources owned by account B. The code I am using works for roles I got from my client but is not working for roles I defined between the two AWS accounts I have access to. What could be the issue?"

        "content": "Assuming a role in AWS from another role involves setting up trust policies and permissions correctly. Here\u2019s a guide to troubleshoot and ensure everything is set up properly:\n\n1. **Trust Relationship for Role-B**:\n   - Ensure that Role-B in Account B has a trust relationship allowing Role-A from Account A to assume it. The trust policy for Role-B should look something like this:\n\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n       \"Statement\": [\n         {\n           \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n           \"Principal\": {\n             \"AWS\": \"arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT-A-ID:role/Role-A\"\n           },\n           \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\"\n         }\n       ]\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. **Permissions for Role-A**:\n   - Ensure Role-A in Account A has the necessary permissions to assume Role-B. This typically involves having `sts:AssumeRole` permission. The policy attached to Role-A might look like this:\n\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n       \"Statement\": [\n         {\n           \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n           \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\",\n           \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT-B-ID:role/Role-B\"\n         }\n       ]\n     }\n     ```\n\n3. **Assuming Role-B**:\n   - When you assume Role-A, you receive temporary security credentials. Use these credentials to call `AssumeRole` for Role-B. Make sure your code is correctly using these temporary credentials.\n\n4. **Cross-Account Role Assumption Code**:\n   - Here is a basic example using AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to assume Role-B:\n\n     ```python\n     import boto3\n\n     # Assume Role-A\n     client_a = boto3.client('sts')\n     response_a = client_a.assume_role(\n         RoleArn='arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT-A-ID:role/Role-A',\n         RoleSessionName='SessionRoleA'\n     )\n\n     # Use temporary credentials from Role-A to assume Role-B\n     client_b = boto3.client(\n         'sts',\n         aws_access_key_id=response_a['Credentials']['AccessKeyId'],\n         aws_secret_access_key=response_a['Credentials']['SecretAccessKey'],\n         aws_session_token=response_a['Credentials']['SessionToken']\n     )\n\n     response_b = client_b.assume_role(\n         RoleArn='arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT-B-ID:role/Role-B',\n         RoleSessionName='SessionRoleB'\n     )\n\n     # Now use the temporary credentials from Role-B\n     credentials = response_b['Credentials']\n     # Use these credentials to access resources in Account B\n     ```\n\n5. **Other Considerations**:\n   - **Session Name**: Ensure a unique session name is used for each `AssumeRole` call.\n   - **Policy**: If you have specified a session policy in the `AssumeRole` call, make sure it doesn't restrict the necessary permissions.\n   - **Account ID and Role Names**: Double-check the AWS account IDs and role names for typos.\n\n6. **Debugging**:\n   - Check AWS CloudTrail logs for any errors or issues related to `AssumeRole` calls.\n   - Ensure that any service control policies (SCPs) in AWS Organizations are not restricting the role assumption.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the issue with assuming Role-B from Role-A."
