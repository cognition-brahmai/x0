The code should take a list of strings for example - \"hello\", \"hi\", \"how are you\", \"goodbye\", \"great\" and so on. Then, as a user starts typing in the terminal, if there's a match possibility, the code should provide the hint for possible strings from which the user can choose. This should be similar to vim editor or google incremental search. For instance, if a user starts typing \"h\", they should get the hint \"ello\", \"i\", \"ow are you\". Ideally, the code should be able to complete words not only from the beginning but also from an arbitrary part of the string."

        "content": "Implementing an autocompletion feature in a Linux terminal can be achieved using a variety of programming languages and tools. One common approach is to use a Python script with the `readline` library, which provides facilities for managing user inputs and autocompletion. Below is a simple example of how you might achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport readline\n\n# List of strings to provide autocompletion hints\ncompletion_list = [\"hello\", \"hi\", \"how are you\", \"goodbye\", \"great\"]\n\ndef completer(text, state):\n    # Generate matches for completion\n    matches = [s for s in completion_list if text in s]\n    try:\n        return matches[state]\n    except IndexError:\n        return None\n\n# Register the completer function\nreadline.set_completer(completer)\n\n# Use tab key for completion\nreadline.parse_and_bind(\"tab: complete\")\n\ndef main():\n    while True:\n        # Prompt user for input\n        user_input = input(\"Type something: \")\n        if user_input.lower() in [\"exit\", \"quit\"]:\n            print(\"Exiting...\")\n            break\n        else:\n            print(f\"You entered: {user_input}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Completion List**: We define a list of strings that we want to use for autocompletion.\n2. **Completer Function**: This function is called by `readline` to determine possible completions. It iterates through the list and returns matches based on the current input.\n3. **Readline Setup**: We register our `completer` function with `readline.set_completer()` and bind the `tab` key to trigger the completion.\n4. **Input Loop**: We use a simple loop to prompt the user for input, allowing them to type and see suggestions.\n\n### Usage:\n- Run the script in a terminal.\n- Start typing one of the phrases from `completion_list`.\n- Press `Tab` to see the suggestions.\n\n### Note:\n- This script is a basic example and may not handle all edge cases.\n- For more complex requirements, consider enhancing the script with additional features, such as case insensitivity or more sophisticated matching logic.\n\nThis setup provides a basic autocomplete functionality similar to what you might find in editors like Vim or search engines like Google."
