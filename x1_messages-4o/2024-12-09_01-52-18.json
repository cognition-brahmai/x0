Here's how you can set it up:\n\n1. **Open Sublime Text 2**: Launch the Sublime Text 2 editor on your computer.\n\n2. **Create a New Build System**:\n   - Go to `Tools` in the top menu.\n   - Select `Build System` > `New Build System...`.\n\n3. **Configure the Build System**:\n   - A new file named `untitled.sublime-build` will open. Replace its content with the following configuration:\n\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"cmd\": [\"python\", \"-u\", \"$file\"],\n       \"file_regex\": \"^[ ]*File \\\"(...*?)\\\", line ([0-9]*)\",\n       \"selector\": \"source.python\"\n     }\n     ```\n\n   - Make sure that the `\"cmd\"` path points to the Python executable. If `python` doesn't work, you might need to specify the full path, for example, `[\"C:/Python39/python.exe\", \"-u\", \"$file\"]` on Windows or `[\"/usr/bin/python3\", \"-u\", \"$file\"]` on Unix-based systems.\n\n4. **Save the Build System**:\n   - Save the file with a descriptive name, such as `Python.sublime-build`. It will automatically be saved in the User folder of the Sublime Text packages.\n\n5. **Select the Build System**:\n   - Go to `Tools` > `Build System` and select the `Python` option or whatever name you saved the build system as.\n\n6. **Run Python Code**:\n   - Open a Python file or write some Python code in a new file.\n   - Save the file with a `.py` extension.\n   - Press `Ctrl + B` (or `Cmd + B` on macOS) to build and run your Python script within Sublime Text 2.\n\nThe output will appear in the build output panel at the bottom of the editor. This setup allows you to run Python scripts directly from within Sublime Text 2 using the build system."
