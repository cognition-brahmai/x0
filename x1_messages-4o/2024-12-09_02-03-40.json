I have a kernel that produces 2 complex matrices based on certain parameters. The kernel works fine when the matrices are of size 256x256 but crashes with an \"uncorrectable ECC error encountered\" when I try to use 512 threads or more. This issue seems to occur when the kernel tries to calculate the real and imaginary components of the second output matrix using the cos and sine values of a calculated fractional value. Despite the occupancy calculator showing I'm using less than the 32,768 registers with 512 threads, the problem persists. Here is the pseudo code and ptxas info:\n\n```\nkernel()\n{\n    // Extract 999 vector from 2D array 999xM - one 999 vector for each thread.\n    for (int i = 0; i < 999; i++)\n    {\n        .....\n    }\n\n    // Cycle through the 2nd dimension of the output matrices\n    for (int j = 0; j < N; j++)\n    {\n        // Calculate some intermediate variables\n\n        // Calculate the real and imaginary components of the first output matrix\n        // real = cos(value), imaginary = sin(value)\n\n        // Construct the first output matrix from some intermediate variables and the real and imaginary components\n\n        // Calculate some more intermediate variables\n\n        // cycle through the extracted vector (0 .. 998)\n        for (int k = 0; k < 999; k++)\n        {\n\n            // Calculate some more intermediate variables\n\n            // Determine the range of allowed values to contribute to the second output matrix.\n\n            // Calculate the real and imaginary components of the second output matrix\n            // real = cos(value), imaginary = sin(value)\n            // This is where it crashes, unless real and imaginary are constant values (1.0)\n\n            // Sum up the contributions of the extracted vector to the second output matrix\n\n        }\n        // Construct the Second output matrix from some intermediate variables and the real and imaginary components\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```\nptxas info    : Compiling entry function '_Z40KerneliidddddPKdS0_S0_S0_iiiiiiiiiPdS1_S1_S1_S1_S1_S1_S1_S1_S1_' for 'sm_20' \n\nptxas info    : Function properties for _Z40KerneliidddddPKdS0_S0_S0_iiiiiiiiiPdS1_S1_S1_S1_S1_S1_S1_S1_S1_ \n\n8056 bytes stack frame, 0 bytes spill stores, 0 bytes spill loads \n\nptxas info    : Function properties for __internal_trig_reduction_slowpathd \n\n40 bytes stack frame, 0 bytes spill stores, 0 bytes spill loads \n\nptxas info    : Used 53 registers, 232 bytes cmem[0], 144 bytes cmem[2], 28 bytes cmem[16]\n\ntmpxft_00001d70_00000000-3_MexFunciton.cudafe1.cpp \n```\n\nCan anyone suggest why this might be happening?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with the \"uncorrectable ECC error\" when increasing the number of threads is likely related to memory limitations or hardware constraints on your Tesla C2050 GPU. Here are some suggestions to help you diagnose and potentially resolve the problem:\n\n1. **ECC Memory Errors**: ECC (Error-Correcting Code) memory errors can occur due to hardware faults or when the GPU memory is being overloaded. The Tesla C2050 has ECC memory, which is designed to detect and correct errors, but uncorrectable errors can lead to program crashes. Consider the following steps:\n   - **Check GPU Temperature**: High temperatures can lead to memory errors. Ensure that your GPU is adequately cooled.\n   - **Run Memory Diagnostics**: Use NVIDIA's utilities to diagnose memory issues. `nvidia-smi` can provide details on memory usage and error counts.\n\n2. **Kernel and Memory Usage**:\n   - **Shared Memory and Registers**: Your kernel uses a significant number of registers (53). If the number of threads is increased, the register file may become overutilized, leading to issues. Try reducing the number of registers per thread by optimizing your code.\n   - **Shared Memory**: Ensure you are not exceeding the shared memory limit. Analyze your shared memory usage and see if optimization is possible.\n\n3. **Code Optimization**:\n   - **Intermediate Variables**: Make sure that your intermediate calculations are efficient and do not use excessive resources. Use `__restrict__` qualifiers for pointers if applicable, to help the compiler with optimizations.\n   - **Trigonometric Functions**: The trigonometric calculations (`cos` and `sin`) can be computationally expensive. Consider approximating these functions if high precision is not required.\n\n4. **Kernel Configuration**:\n   - **Thread Block Size**: Experiment with different block sizes. Sometimes, the default configuration might not be optimal for your specific memory and compute constraints.\n   - **Occupancy**: Use NVIDIA's CUDA Occupancy Calculator to find optimal configurations for your kernel to balance resource usage.\n\n5. **Error Handling**:\n   - **CUDA Error Checking**: Ensure you have proper error checking after your kernel launches. Use `cudaGetLastError()` to diagnose issues immediately after kernel execution.\n   - **ECC Error Reporting**: Enable detailed ECC error reporting using NVIDIA's tools to gain more insights into what's causing the issue.\n\n6. **CUDA Version and Drivers**:\n   - **Update Drivers and Toolkit**: If possible, update to a more recent version of CUDA and the corresponding NVIDIA drivers. There may be bug fixes or optimizations that could help with your issue.\n\n7. **Hardware Tests**:\n   - **Test with Different Hardware**: If possible, test your code on a different GPU to see if the issue persists, which can help determine if it's hardware-specific.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify the root cause of the error. If the problem persists, consider reaching out to NVIDIA support or querying forums with specific details of your hardware and setup for more targeted advice."
