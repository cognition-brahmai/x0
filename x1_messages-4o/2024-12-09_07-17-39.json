Whenever I open Python in a terminal window, it exits with a \"Segmentation error: 11\" after the second line I input, regardless of the commands I enter. For instance, if I type:\n\n```python\n>>> for x in range(1000): print(x)\n```\nIt works perfectly, but if I enter:\n\n```python\n>>> for x in range(1000):\n...     print(x)\n```\nI receive the error after pressing enter on the second line. However, running a script with more than two lines doesn't cause any issues. I recently updated to OSX 10.9, and also installed IPython along with some other packages. I also had some unsuccessful attempts at installing PyQt where I ran configure.py but the \"make\" command failed. I even tried reinstalling Python, but the problem persists. IPython and IDLE are working without issues, but I am concerned about this underlying problem. Can you help me solve this?"

        "content": "The issue you are experiencing with Python on your OSX 10.9 environment could be due to several factors, including conflicts with installed packages or misconfigurations in your Python setup. Here's a step-by-step guide to troubleshooting and resolving the segmentation fault error:\n\n1. **Check Python Installation:**\n   - Ensure that your Python installation is not corrupted. You can try reinstalling Python using a package manager like Homebrew, which often handles dependencies more gracefully. To do this, you can uninstall Python and then reinstall it:\n     ```bash\n     brew uninstall python\n     brew install python\n     ```\n\n2. **Environment Variables:**\n   - Check your environment variables for any misconfigurations or conflicts. Specifically, ensure that `PYTHONPATH` and `PATH` do not contain conflicting paths from previous installations.\n\n3. **Python Extensions:**\n   - Segmentation faults can often be caused by native extensions. If you have any custom or third-party C extensions, try disabling them to see if the issue persists.\n\n4. **Verify Python Packages:**\n   - Sometimes, installed packages can cause compatibility issues. Try creating a new virtual environment and see if the issue occurs there:\n     ```bash\n     python3 -m venv myenv\n     source myenv/bin/activate\n     ```\n   - Within the virtual environment, try running your code again.\n\n5. **Check System Updates:**\n   - Ensure your system is up-to-date with the latest patches and updates from Apple, as sometimes these updates can fix underlying system issues.\n\n6. **Troubleshoot PyQt Installation:**\n   - Since you mentioned issues with PyQt, ensure that any unsuccessful installations have been completely removed. You can use Homebrew or another package manager to install PyQt:\n     ```bash\n     brew install pyqt\n     ```\n\n7. **Check for IPython or Other Shell Issues:**\n   - Since IPython and IDLE are working fine, it could indicate an issue with the default Python REPL. Consider using IPython as a default if it meets your needs.\n\n8. **Consult Logs and Crash Reports:**\n   - Look into system logs and crash reports for more details on the segmentation fault. This can provide clues on what might be causing the problem.\n\n9. **Consider Upgrading Python:**\n   - Python 3.3.2 is quite old, and upgrading to a more recent version might resolve compatibility issues. You can use Homebrew to install the latest Python version:\n     ```bash\n     brew install python@3.x\n     ```\n\nIf none of the above steps resolve the issue, consider reaching out to the Python community on forums or Stack Overflow, as there might be others who have encountered and solved similar issues."
