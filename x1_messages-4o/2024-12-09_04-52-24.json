However, when I print it, the figure only fills half of an A4 sheet. Even after modifying the string to `savefig(\"foo.eps\", papertype = 'a4', orientation = 'portrait', format = 'eps')`, nothing changes. How can I set the size of the figure in a way that it fills the whole A4 sheet?"

        "content": "To ensure that your figure fills the entire A4 sheet when saving as an EPS file in Python, you can explicitly set the figure size to match the dimensions of an A4 sheet. Here's how you can do it using Matplotlib:\n\n1. **Set the Figure Size:** You can specify the figure size in inches that corresponds to an A4 paper size, which is approximately 8.27 x 11.69 inches.\n\n2. **Use `bbox_inches='tight'`:** This option helps to ensure that the entire figure area is saved, without any clipping.\n\nHere is an example code snippet to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Create a new figure with the specified size\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8.27, 11.69))  # A4 size in inches (width x height)\n\n# Example plot (you can replace this with your actual plotting code)\nax.plot([1, 2, 3], [1, 4, 9])\n\n# Save the figure with the desired settings\nplt.savefig(\"foo.eps\", format='eps', bbox_inches='tight')\n\n# Show the plot (optional)\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis code sets the dimensions of the figure to match A4 size, ensuring that when you save it, it fills the entire sheet. Adjust the plotting content as needed, and your saved figure should now fill the A4 paper size when printed."
