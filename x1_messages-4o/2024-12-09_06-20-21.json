Here is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\nwith open('test.csv', 'w') as outfile:\n    writer = csv.writer(outfile, delimiter=',', quoting=csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL)\n    writer.writerow(['hi', 'dude'])\n    writer.writerow(['hi2', 'dude2'])\n```\n\nThe generated `test.csv` file looks like this:\n\n```\nhi,dude\\r\\r\\nhi2,dude2\\r\\r\\n\n```\n\nInstead of the expected:\n\n```\nhi,dude\\r\\nhi2,dude2\\r\\n\n```\n\nWhy is this happening and how can I fix this?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with the extra carriage return (`\\r`) in your CSV file is due to the way the file is opened and the default behavior of the CSV module in Python, particularly on Windows. The problem arises because the CSV writer is adding an extra `\\r` to the end of each line when writing in text mode on Windows systems.\n\nTo fix this, you should open the output file in binary mode with newline control by specifying the `newline=''` parameter in the `open()` function. This ensures that the CSV writer handles newlines correctly without adding additional carriage returns.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\nwith open('test.csv', 'w', newline='') as outfile:\n    writer = csv.writer(outfile, delimiter=',', quoting=csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL)\n    writer.writerow(['hi', 'dude'])\n    writer.writerow(['hi2', 'dude2'])\n```\n\nBy specifying `newline=''`, you allow the `csv` module to handle newlines correctly, which will prevent the addition of extra carriage returns. This should resolve the issue and produce the expected output:\n\n```\nhi,dude\\r\\nhi2,dude2\\r\\n\n```"
