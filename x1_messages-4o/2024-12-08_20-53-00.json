So, any multiple of 15 must include both 3 and 5 in its prime factorization.\n\n2. **Product of two prime numbers**: We need a number that is the product of exactly two prime numbers, one of which must be either 3 or 5.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n- If one of the primes is 3, then the other must be 5 for it to be a multiple of 15.\n- If one of the primes is 5, then the other must be 3 for it to be a multiple of 15.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer that is both a multiple of 15 and the product of exactly two prime numbers is \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\).\n\nNow, the unique prime factors of 15 are 3 and 5. The product of these unique prime factors is:\n\n\\[3 \\times 5 = 15\\]\n\nSo, the product of the unique prime factors is 15."
