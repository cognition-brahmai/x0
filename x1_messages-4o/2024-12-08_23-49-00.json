Can you provide a sample code snippet for this?\nHere's a sample code snippet that you can use:\nvar primes = [Int]()\nvar isPrime = [Bool](repeating: true, count: 100)\nfor i in 2..<isPrime.count {\n    if isPrime[i] {\n        primes.append(i)\n        for j in stride(from: i*i, to: isPrime.count, by: i) {\n            isPrime[j] = false\n        }\n    }\n}\nlet first15Primes = primes.prefix(15)\nprint(first15Primes) \nThis code initializes an array of boolean values that are all true. Then, for each number starting from 2, it checks if it is a prime number by checking if the corresponding boolean value is true. If it is, it appends the number to an array of prime numbers and sets all multiples of the number to false in the boolean array. Finally, it takes the first 15 prime numbers and prints them out."

        "content": "The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a classic algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a specified integer. The code snippet you provided is a good example of how to implement this algorithm in Swift to find the first 15 prime numbers. Here's a slightly refined version of the code with comments to help you understand each step:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nfunc generatePrimes(count: Int) -> [Int] {\n    var primes = [Int]()\n    let limit = 100 // Initial upper bound guess, can be adjusted\n    var isPrime = [Bool](repeating: true, count: limit)\n\n    // Start checking from the first prime number\n    for i in 2..<isPrime.count {\n        // If the number is still marked as prime\n        if isPrime[i] {\n            primes.append(i)\n            \n            // Mark all multiples of i as non-prime\n            for j in stride(from: i * i, to: isPrime.count, by: i) {\n                isPrime[j] = false\n            }\n            \n            // Stop if we have found the desired count of prime numbers\n            if primes.count == count {\n                break\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return primes\n}\n\nlet first15Primes = generatePrimes(count: 15)\nprint(first15Primes)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Initial Setup:** We create an array `isPrime` to track if numbers are prime. All numbers are initially assumed to be prime (true).\n- **Iterate Over Numbers:** Starting from 2, we iterate through the numbers. If a number is still marked as prime, we add it to the `primes` array.\n- **Mark Multiples:** For each prime number `i`, we mark all multiples of `i` as non-prime (false).\n- **Limit Adjustments:** The initial upper limit is set to 100, which is more than enough for the first 15 primes. If you needed more primes, you might have to increase this limit.\n- **Output:** Finally, we print the first 15 primes found.\n\nThis code is efficient and leverages the Sieve of Eratosthenes to quickly determine prime numbers. Adjust the `limit` if you're working with a larger range or need more primes."
