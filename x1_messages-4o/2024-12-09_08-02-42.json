Currently, it's creating two plots where the index of the list gives the x-coordinate, the first plot's y values are the 'a's in the pairs and the second plot's y values are the 'b's in the pairs. The data looks like this: li = [(a,b), (c,d), ... , (t, u)]. I am trying to plot these pairs using plt.plot() in a single line of code. However, the current implementation is giving me an incorrect plot. Here's a sample of my data and the incorrect plot code:\n\n```\n# sample data\nli = list(zip(range(1, 14), range(14, 27)))\n\nli \u2192 [(1, 14), (2, 15), (3, 16), (4, 17), (5, 18), (6, 19), (7, 20), (8, 21), (9, 22), (10, 23), (11, 24), (12, 25), (13, 26)]\n\nplt.plot(li)\nplt.title('Incorrect Plot:\\nEach index of the tuple plotted as separate lines')\n```\nThis gives me an incorrect plot. The correct plot can be achieved by unpacking 'li' and plotting it but it uses multiple lines of code, not a single line. Here is the correct plot code:\n\n```\nxs = [x[0] for x in li]\nys = [x[1] for x in li]\nplt.plot(xs, ys)\nplt.title('Correct Plot:\\nBut uses too many lines to unpack li')\n```\nHow can I get matplotlib to plot these pairs as x-y coordinates in a single line of code?"

        "content": "You can achieve the desired plot by using Python's unpacking feature directly in the `plt.plot()` function. You can utilize the `zip` function to unpack the list of pairs into two separate lists, which can then be used as the x and y coordinates. Here's how you can do it in a single line of code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nli = list(zip(range(1, 14), range(14, 27)))\n\nplt.plot(*zip(*li))\nplt.title('Correct Plot:\\nUsing a single line to unpack li')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this code, `*zip(*li)` effectively unpacks the list of tuples `li` into two separate sequences: one for x-values and one for y-values, which `plt.plot()` can then use to plot the data correctly."
