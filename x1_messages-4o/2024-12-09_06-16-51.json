In SQL, I have a query as follows:\n```SQL\nSELECT SUM(ISNULL(table.name)) FROM table\n```\nI want to understand how this `SUM` operation translates into a `QuerySet` in Django. Specifically, I'm looking for the operation `xyz` that it translates to, in something like `MyModel.objects.xyz()`."

        "content": "To translate a SQL `SUM` query into a Django QuerySet, you'll use Django's aggregation functions. In SQL, you might have a query that sums up values, potentially replacing `NULL` values with a default. In Django, you can achieve similar outcomes using the `Sum` aggregation function along with `Coalesce` to handle `NULL` values.\n\nHere's how you can translate your SQL query into Django QuerySet:\n\n1. **Using `Sum`**: You will use `Sum` to perform the summation.\n2. **Handling `NULL` values**: Use `Coalesce` to replace `NULL` values with a default value (like 0).\n\nHere's a step-by-step translation of your SQL query into a Django QuerySet:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db.models import Sum, F\nfrom django.db.models.functions import Coalesce\n\n# Assuming 'MyModel' is your model and 'name' is the field you are working with.\ntotal = MyModel.objects.aggregate(\n    total_sum=Sum(\n        Coalesce('name', 0)\n    )\n)\n\n# 'total_sum' will hold the result of the sum operation\nprint(total['total_sum'])\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **`Coalesce('name', 0)`**: This part handles the `ISNULL(table.name)` part of your SQL query by replacing `NULL` values with 0.\n- **`Sum(...)`**: This is the equivalent of the `SUM` function in SQL.\n\nBy using `Coalesce`, you ensure that any `NULL` values in the `name` field are treated as 0 during the summation, mimicking the behavior of `ISNULL` in SQL.\n\nThis approach will give you the summed total of the `name` field in the `MyModel` table while accounting for `NULL` values."
