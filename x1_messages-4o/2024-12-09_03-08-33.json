Usually, I write the function myself by comparing predicted and test vectors, and then retrieving the documents from the test document array. However, I'm interested in knowing if there's a built-in functionality for this in scikitlearn, so that I don't have to replicate this functionality in every Python script I write."

        "content": "As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, scikit-learn does not have a built-in function specifically designed to directly retrieve misclassified documents. Typically, identifying misclassified samples involves comparing the predicted labels with the true labels, which is a straightforward approach but requires a bit of manual coding.\n\nHere is a general approach you can use:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n\n# Assuming y_test is your true labels and y_pred is your predicted labels\nmisclassified_indices = [i for i, (true, pred) in enumerate(zip(y_test, y_pred)) if true != pred]\n\n# Retrieve misclassified documents\nmisclassified_documents = [test_documents[i] for i in misclassified_indices]\n\n# Print or process the misclassified documents\nfor doc in misclassified_documents:\n    print(doc)\n```\n\nAlthough scikit-learn does not provide a direct method to do this, you can encapsulate this logic into a function or a utility module in your codebase for reuse across different projects. Alternatively, you might consider writing a custom transformer or utility function to streamline this process.\n\nIf you're looking for a more feature-rich solution, exploring other NLP or ML libraries such as Hugging Face's Transformers or custom implementations might be beneficial, but they might also require additional setup and understanding."
