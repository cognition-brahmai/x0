I want this processing to be identical to how Python inherently processes escape sequences in string literals. For instance, if I have a string `myString = \"spam\\\\neggs\"`, when printed, it appears as `spam\\neggs`. I want to create a function, say `process`, that would print this string as:\n\n```\nspam\neggs\n```\nThis function should be able to process all types of escape sequences as defined in Python. Does Python have any built-in function for this?"

        "content": "To process escape sequences in a string obtained from a file or user input, you can use the `unicode_escape` codec in Python. This approach will allow you to interpret escape sequences in a string similarly to how Python handles them in string literals.\n\nHere's how you can define a function `process` that does this:\n\n```python\ndef process(input_string):\n    return input_string.encode().decode('unicode_escape')\n\n# Example usage:\nmyString = \"spam\\\\neggs\"\nprocessed_string = process(myString)\nprint(processed_string)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nspam\neggs\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Encoding**: The `encode()` method converts the string into bytes. Since the default encoding is 'utf-8', it remains unchanged in terms of content.\n\n2. **Decoding with `unicode_escape`**: The `decode('unicode_escape')` method processes the escape sequences in the byte string. It interprets sequences like `\\n` as newline characters, `\\t` as tabs, etc., effectively converting them into their corresponding characters, just as they would be interpreted in a Python string literal.\n\nThis way, you can handle all standard escape sequences defined by Python, including `\\n`, `\\t`, `\\\\`, `\\'`, `\\\"`, and so forth."
