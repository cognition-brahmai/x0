        "content": "To define a function in Tkinter to close a window or end the program, you can use the `destroy()` method of the `Tk` object or the `quit()` method. Here's how you can implement the `quit` function to exit your application:\n\n```python\nfrom tkinter import *  # Use 'tkinter' instead of 'Tkinter' for Python 3\n\ndef quit():\n    root.destroy()  # This will close the window and end the application\n\nroot = Tk()\nButton(root, text=\"Quit\", command=quit).pack()\nroot.mainloop()\n```\n\nIn this example, the `quit` function calls `root.destroy()`, which terminates the application by closing the main window. This is the most common way to exit a Tkinter application. If you use `root.quit()`, it will stop the main loop but not necessarily close the window; `root.destroy()` is often more straightforward for ending the application."
