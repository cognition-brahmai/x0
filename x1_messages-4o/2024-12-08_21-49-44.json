The farmer wants to put a fence around the entire field, but he only has 90 meters of fence available. What are the dimensions of the field that will maximize its area? Explain your reasoning."

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimensions of the field that will maximize its area given the constraint of the perimeter.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( w \\) as the width of the field in meters,\n- \\( l \\) as the length of the field in meters.\n\nAccording to the problem, the length \\( l \\) is 15 meters more than the width \\( w \\). Therefore, we can express the length as:\n\\[ l = w + 15 \\]\n\nThe perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n\\[ P = 2l + 2w \\]\n\nWe know the perimeter is 90 meters, so we set up the equation:\n\\[ 2(w + 15) + 2w = 90 \\]\n\nSimplify and solve for \\( w \\):\n\\[ 2w + 30 + 2w = 90 \\]\n\\[ 4w + 30 = 90 \\]\n\\[ 4w = 60 \\]\n\\[ w = 15 \\]\n\nNow that we have the width, we can find the length:\n\\[ l = w + 15 = 15 + 15 = 30 \\]\n\nThus, the dimensions of the field are:\n- Width \\( w = 15 \\) meters\n- Length \\( l = 30 \\) meters\n\nTo verify if these dimensions maximize the area, consider the area \\( A \\) of the rectangle, which is given by:\n\\[ A = l \\times w \\]\n\nSubstituting the values we found:\n\\[ A = 30 \\times 15 = 450 \\, \\text{square meters} \\]\n\nSince the dimensions satisfy the perimeter constraint and the area is maximized (as further confirmed by the fact that for a given perimeter, a rectangle's area is maximized when it is closest to a square, and these dimensions are significantly skewed due to the problem constraints), the field with these dimensions will maximize the area given the available fencing."
