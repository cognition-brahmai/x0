All the modules are sharing the global variable 'x'. Why is 'x' still 'None'? It seems like 'x' is evaluated in `mid_access_mod.py` before it is assigned in `bot_modif_mod.py` by `mew()`. Can you explain why this is happening?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering arises from the way Python handles module imports and variable scoping. Let's walk through your code to understand why `x` remains `None` when printed.\n\n1. **Module Import Mechanism:**\n   - When you import a module in Python, the code within the module is executed immediately. This means that when `mid_access_mod` is imported, `global_mod.py` is executed and `x` is initialized to `None`.\n\n2. **Variable Scope and Importing:**\n   - In `mid_access_mod.py`, you import `x` using `from global_mod import *`. This creates a local copy of `x` within the `mid_access_mod` namespace. Any changes to `x` in `global_mod` after this import won't be reflected in `mid_access_mod`, because the `import *` creates a separate binding of `x` within the module.\n\n3. **Order of Operations:**\n   - When `bot_modif_mod.py` is executed and `main()` is called, the following happens:\n     - `global_mod.x` is set to `5` by the `mew` class.\n     - Then, `mid_access_mod.delta()` is instantiated, which prints `x`. However, because `x` was imported using `from global_mod import *`, it's using the local copy of `x` that was set to `None` when `mid_access_mod` was imported.\n\n### Solution\n\nTo solve this issue, you should avoid using `from ... import *` if you want to share a mutable global variable across modules. Instead, import the module itself and access the variable explicitly through the module's namespace. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n**In `mid_access_mod.py`:**\n```python\nimport global_mod\n\nclass delta:\n    def __init__(self):\n        print(global_mod.x)\n```\n\nBy making this change, you're referencing `x` directly from `global_mod`, ensuring that you always access the current value of `x` as it is in `global_mod`. Now, when you run `bot_modif_mod.py`, it should print `5` as expected."
