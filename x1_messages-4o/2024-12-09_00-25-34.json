When I execute `pip --version`, it shows that I have pip 1.1 installed in my virtual environment and I want to update it to the latest version. I've attempted the commands `pip update` and `pip update pip` but both have been unsuccessful. Is there a way to do this using distribute, or a native pip or virtualenv command?"

Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Activate your virtual environment**: Make sure you are in your virtual environment. You can activate it using the following command:\n   - On Windows:\n     ```bash\n     path\\to\\env\\Scripts\\activate\n     ```\n   - On macOS/Linux:\n     ```bash\n     source path/to/env/bin/activate\n     ```\n\n2. **Upgrade pip**: Once your virtual environment is activated, run the following command to upgrade `pip`:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade pip\n   ```\n\nThis command will upgrade `pip` to the latest version available.\n\nIf you encounter any issues with permissions or if the above command doesn\u2019t work, you can try using `python -m pip` instead:\n\n```bash\npython -m pip install --upgrade pip\n```\n\nUsing `python -m pip` ensures that the `pip` module is executed as a script using the Python interpreter associated with your virtual environment.\n\nAfter running these commands, you can verify the upgrade by checking the `pip` version again:\n\n```bash\npip --version\n```\n\nThis should show you the latest version of `pip` installed in your virtual environment."
