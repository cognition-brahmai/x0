I have a list of row IDs that I need to fetch, but I do not know the length of this list, and I need to use the SQL \"id IN (id1, id2, ...)\" statement to select the rows. How can I effectively pass these IDs to SQL without having to manually or automatically add as many \"%s\" expressions into the query string as needed, and without having to check the length of the list and concatenate a suitable number of \"%s\" into the query string, which I'm afraid would be slow and inefficient?"

        "content": "To handle a dynamic list of IDs in a SQL query using Python and `psycopg2`, you can use the `psycopg2.sql` module to dynamically construct your query in a safe and efficient manner. This allows you to avoid manually concatenating `%s` placeholders for each ID. Instead, you can use the `IN` clause with a tuple, which is a Python feature that `psycopg2` can handle effectively. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport psycopg2\nfrom psycopg2 import sql\n\n# Connect to your PostgreSQL database\nconn = psycopg2.connect(\n    dbname=\"your_dbname\",\n    user=\"your_username\",\n    password=\"your_password\",\n    host=\"your_host\",\n    port=\"your_port\"\n)\n\n# Create a cursor object\ncur = conn.cursor()\n\n# List of IDs you want to fetch\nid_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Replace with your actual list of IDs\n\n# Construct the SQL query using psycopg2.sql module\nquery = sql.SQL(\"SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE id IN ({})\").format(\n    sql.SQL(', ').join(sql.Placeholder() * len(id_list))\n)\n\n# Execute the query with the list of IDs as parameters\ncur.execute(query, id_list)\n\n# Fetch the results\nrows = cur.fetchall()\n\n# Print the fetched rows\nfor row in rows:\n    print(row)\n\n# Close the cursor and connection\ncur.close()\nconn.close()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **sql.SQL and sql.Placeholder**: These are used to safely construct the query string and placeholders. `sql.Placeholder()` is used to create a `%s` placeholder for each ID dynamically.\n  \n- **sql.SQL(', ').join(sql.Placeholder() * len(id_list))**: This constructs a string of placeholders separated by commas, corresponding to the number of IDs.\n\n- **cur.execute(query, id_list)**: Executes the query with the list of IDs. `psycopg2` automatically matches each placeholder with the corresponding element in the list.\n\nThis method is efficient and secure, protecting against SQL injection by using parameterized queries."
