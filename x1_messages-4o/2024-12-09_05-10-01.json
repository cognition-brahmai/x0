In my code, I have a statement that looks like this: `result = database.Query('complicated sql with an id: %s' % id)`. I have mocked out `database.Query` and I want to test that the ID gets injected correctly into the SQL statement without hardcoding the entire SQL statement into my test. I tried to set up a 'selective mock' in unittest.mock, but I'm struggling to find a way without involving complex `side_effect` logic. I also tried using the regex in the assertion like this: \n\n```\nwith patch(database) as MockDatabase:\n  instance = MockDatabase.return_value\n  ...\n  instance.Query.assert_called_once_with(re.compile(\"%s\" % id))\n```\nbut that doesn't work either. The only approach that seems to work is this, but it's not ideal:\n\n```\nwith patch(database) as MockDatabase:\n  instance = MockDatabase.return_value\n  ...\n  self.assertIn(id, instance.Query.call_args[0][0])\n```\nAre there any better ways to solve this problem?"

        "content": "When testing with `unittest.mock`, you can use `unittest.mock.call` and `unittest.mock.ANY` to create more flexible assertions that allow for partial matches or more complex matching logic. However, since you want to perform a partial match on a string argument passed to a mocked method, using a regular expression is a suitable approach, but it needs to be incorporated correctly into the assertion mechanism.\n\nOne effective way to achieve this is by using custom matching logic with a helper function. Below is a method to achieve this without resorting to too much complexity:\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\n\ndef assert_query_called_with_id(mock_instance, expected_id):\n    # Retrieve the actual call arguments for the `Query` method\n    args, kwargs = mock_instance.Query.call_args\n    \n    # Extract the actual query string\n    actual_query = args[0] if args else ''\n    \n    # Check if the expected ID is present in the actual query\n    if not re.search(re.escape(str(expected_id)), actual_query):\n        raise AssertionError(f\"Expected ID '{expected_id}' not found in query '{actual_query}'\")\n\n# Example of using the custom assertion in a test\nwith patch('database') as MockDatabase:\n    instance = MockDatabase.return_value\n    # Execute the function that makes the Query call\n    # ...\n\n    # Now assert that the Query method was called with the correct ID\n    assert_query_called_with_id(instance, id)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Custom Assertion Function**: `assert_query_called_with_id` is a helper function that encapsulates the logic for checking whether the expected ID is part of the SQL query string. This helps keep your test clean and readable.\n\n2. **Regular Expression**: The function uses `re.search` with `re.escape` to safely find the expected ID within the actual SQL query string. This handles cases where the ID might contain special regex characters.\n\n3. **Assert Logic**: If the ID is not found in the query string, the function raises an `AssertionError` with a descriptive message. This way, you get a clear indication of what went wrong if the test fails.\n\nThis approach provides a clean and robust way to assert that a particular ID is included in the SQL query string without hardcoding the entire SQL statement into your test."
