However, I'm noticing that each time a new line has to be printed, a new progress bar is printed on the next line, resulting in a skewed output. This doesn't occur when I run the script via terminal. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "When using `tqdm` in Jupyter notebooks, it's common to encounter display issues like the one you're describing because of how Jupyter's output system handles updates. To address the problem of having multiple progress bars printed on new lines each time an update occurs, you can use the `tqdm.notebook` module specifically designed for Jupyter environments. Here's how you can adjust your code:\n\n1. **Use `tqdm.notebook.tqdm`**: This version of `tqdm` is optimized for Jupyter notebooks and handles the display more gracefully.\n\n2. **Set `leave=True`**: Ensure the progress bar remains in place after completion, which can help in maintaining a cleaner output if you need to refer back to it.\n\n3. **Use `tqdm.write()` carefully**: When calling `tqdm.write()`, make sure that you are using it in a context where it won't disrupt the flow of your progress bar.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nfrom tqdm.notebook import tqdm\nimport time\n\n# Example usage\nfor i in tqdm(range(100), desc=\"Processing\"):\n    # Simulate work being done\n    time.sleep(0.1)\n    # Use tqdm.write for additional messages\n    if i % 10 == 0:\n        tqdm.write(f\"Reached iteration {i}\")\n```\n\nBy using `tqdm.notebook.tqdm`, you should notice that the progress bars are displayed in a more stable manner, without skewing the output each time a message is written. Additionally, ensure that your Jupyter notebook's version and `tqdm` package are up to date, as improvements and bug fixes are periodically released."
