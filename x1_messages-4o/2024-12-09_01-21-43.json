        "content": "To extract a `.gz` file and save its contents to a local path in Windows using Python, you can indeed use the `gzip` module. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:\n\n1. **Import the necessary modules**: You'll need `gzip` to work with `.gz` files and `shutil` for file operations.\n\n2. **Open the `.gz` file using `gzip`**: Use the `gzip.open()` function to read the contents of the `.gz` file.\n\n3. **Write the extracted content to a new file**: Use Python's built-in file handling to write the decompressed data to a new file.\n\nHere's a sample script that demonstrates these steps:\n\n```python\nimport gzip\nimport shutil\n\n# Define the path to the gz file and the output file\ngz_file_path = 'path/to/your/file.xml.gz'\noutput_file_path = 'path/to/your/output/file.xml'\n\n# Open the gz file and extract its contents\nwith gzip.open(gz_file_path, 'rb') as gz_file:\n    with open(output_file_path, 'wb') as output_file:\n        shutil.copyfileobj(gz_file, output_file)\n\nprint(f\"The file has been extracted to {output_file_path}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **gzip.open()**: Opens the `.gz` file in binary read mode (`'rb'`).\n- **shutil.copyfileobj()**: Copies the content from the `gz_file` to the `output_file`.\n- **File Handling**: The `with` statement ensures that files are properly closed after their suite finishes.\n\nMake sure to replace `path/to/your/file.xml.gz` and `path/to/your/output/file.xml` with the actual paths to your `.gz` file and desired output file location.\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- Ensure that Python is installed on your system and that you're using a version that supports the modules used here.\n- Make sure you have the necessary permissions to read from the source path and write to the destination path.\n- If the `.gz` file is large, consider reading and writing in chunks to manage memory usage effectively."
