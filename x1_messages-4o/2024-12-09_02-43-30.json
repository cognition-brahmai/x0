        "content": "To write a Python list of lists into a CSV file, you can use Python's built-in `csv` module. This module provides functionality to both read from and write to CSV files. Here's how you can write your list of lists to a CSV file:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\n# Your list of lists\na = [\n    [1.2, 'abc', 3],\n    [1.2, 'werew', 4],\n    # Add more lists as needed\n    [1.4, 'qew', 2]\n]\n\n# Specify the filename\nfilename = 'output.csv'\n\n# Open the file in write mode\nwith open(filename, mode='w', newline='') as file:\n    writer = csv.writer(file)\n\n    # Write each sublist to the CSV file\n    for sublist in a:\n        writer.writerow(sublist)\n\nprint(f'Data has been written to {filename}')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Importing the `csv` Module**: This module is used for handling CSV files in Python.\n\n2. **Opening the File**: The `open()` function opens the file in write mode (`'w'`). The `newline=''` parameter is used to prevent extra blank rows in some cases.\n\n3. **Creating a CSV Writer Object**: `csv.writer(file)` creates an object that will be used to write rows to the CSV file.\n\n4. **Writing Rows**: `writer.writerow(sublist)` writes each sublist in the list `a` as a separate row in the CSV file.\n\n5. **Output**: The data from your list is written in the specified format to `output.csv`.\n\nThis code will create a CSV file named `output.csv` with the desired format."
