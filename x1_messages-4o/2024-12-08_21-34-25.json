Additionally, how can the code be adjusted to enable partial matching of the scientist's name? Kindly provide an exemplary code using the given dataset: \nconst scientists = [\n  {\n    name: \"Albert Einstein\",\n    achievement: \"Theory of General Relativity\"\n  },\n  {\n    name: \"Marie Curie\",\n    achievement: \"Discovery of Radium and Polonium\"\n  },\n  {\n    name: \"Isaac Newton\",\n    achievement: \"Laws of Motion and Universal Gravitation\"\n  }\n];"

        "content": "To search for a specific scientist and their most significant achievement from a list of scientists, you can use JavaScript's array methods like `filter` or `find`. To enable partial matching of the scientist's name, you can use the `String.prototype.includes()` method for case-sensitive matching or `String.prototype.toLowerCase()` combined with `includes()` for case-insensitive matching.\n\nHere's an exemplary code snippet that demonstrates how to achieve this:\n\n```javascript\nconst scientists = [\n  {\n    name: \"Albert Einstein\",\n    achievement: \"Theory of General Relativity\"\n  },\n  {\n    name: \"Marie Curie\",\n    achievement: \"Discovery of Radium and Polonium\"\n  },\n  {\n    name: \"Isaac Newton\",\n    achievement: \"Laws of Motion and Universal Gravitation\"\n  }\n];\n\nfunction findScientistByName(scientists, searchName) {\n  // Convert searchName to lower case for case-insensitive search\n  const lowerCaseSearchName = searchName.toLowerCase();\n\n  // Use the find method to search for the first scientist matching the partial name\n  const result = scientists.find(scientist =>\n    scientist.name.toLowerCase().includes(lowerCaseSearchName)\n  );\n\n  return result ? result : \"Scientist not found\";\n}\n\n// Example usage\nconst searchName = \"einstein\"; // Partial search term\nconst foundScientist = findScientistByName(scientists, searchName);\n\nconsole.log(foundScientist);\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Function Definition**: `findScientistByName` is defined to take the list of scientists and the search term as arguments.\n- **Case Insensitivity**: The search name is converted to lowercase to ensure the search is case-insensitive.\n- **Array Method**: The `find` method is used to locate the first scientist whose name includes the partial search term. It returns the entire object if a match is found.\n- **Includes Method**: `includes` is used to check if the scientist's name contains the search term.\n- **Output**: If a matching scientist is found, their details are returned; otherwise, a \"Scientist not found\" message is returned.\n\nThis code allows for flexible searching of scientists by partial name and retrieves their most significant achievements."
