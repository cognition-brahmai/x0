Currently, my script is only capturing the standard output but the standard error still appears in the terminal.

This redirects file descriptor 2 (stderr) to file descriptor 1 (stdout), and then both are redirected to the log file.\n\nHere's how you can modify your script:\n\n```bash\nCommand1 >> log_file 2>&1\nCommand2 >> log_file 2>&1\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you want to redirect stdout and stderr for all commands in your script, you can use an overall redirection by placing the redirection at the beginning of your script:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Redirect stdout (1) and stderr (2) to the log file\nexec >> log_file 2>&1\n\nCommand1\nCommand2\n```\n\nThis way, all commands executed in the script will have their stdout and stderr redirected to `log_file`."
