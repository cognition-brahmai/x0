        "content": "The error you're encountering, `SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed`, indicates that the SSL certificate presented by the server could not be verified. This is a common issue when dealing with internal networks or self-signed certificates. Here's how you can address this problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Cause**:  \n   The server's SSL certificate might not be from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA), or it could be self-signed. Browsers can often handle these situations by prompting the user, but Python's SSL library is stricter and will reject such certificates by default.\n\n2. **Solutions**:\n\n   **Option 1: Bypass SSL Verification**  \n   While not recommended for production code due to security risks, you can temporarily bypass SSL verification for testing purposes:\n   ```python\n   import requests\n\n   # Add verify=False to bypass SSL certificate verification\n   response = requests.get('https://your-intranet-url.com', verify=False)\n   print(response.content)\n   ```\n   **Note**: This exposes you to potential security risks like man-in-the-middle attacks, so only use this method if you're sure the connection is safe.\n\n   **Option 2: Use a Custom Certificate**  \n   If you have a copy of the server's certificate, you can use it to establish a trusted connection:\n   ```python\n   import requests\n\n   # Path to the server certificate\n   cert_file = '/path/to/certificate.pem'\n\n   response = requests.get('https://your-intranet-url.com', verify=cert_file)\n   print(response.content)\n   ```\n\n   **Option 3: Add to Trusted Certificates**  \n   You can add the server's certificate to your system's trusted CA store, which is a more permanent and secure solution. The process varies by operating system.\n\n3. **Further Steps**:\n   - **Contact IT**: If this is a corporate or institutional network, contact your IT department. They can provide the necessary certificates or configure your system for secure access.\n   - **Update Python/Requests**: Ensure that you're using the latest version of Python and the `requests` library. Sometimes, updates can resolve SSL issues.\n\nRemember, while bypassing SSL verification might be convenient during development, it's essential to ensure secure connections in production environments."
