        "content": "To extract data from a specific table in a SQLite database using Swift, you can certainly refine your existing code to make it more efficient and readable. Additionally, using the SQLite.swift library is a great choice for working with SQLite databases in Swift, as it provides a nice Swift interface for SQLite.\n\nHere's a more efficient and organized way to extract data from a specific table using SQLite.swift:\n\n```swift\nimport SQLite\n\ndo {\n    // Establish a connection to the SQLite database\n    let db = try Connection(\"path/to/database.sqlite3\")\n\n    // Define the table you want to query\n    let myTable = Table(\"myTable\")\n\n    // Define the columns you're interested in\n    let id = Expression<Int>(\"id\")\n    let name = Expression<String>(\"name\")\n    let age = Expression<Int>(\"age\")\n\n    // Prepare and execute the query, fetching data from the specified table\n    for row in try db.prepare(myTable) {\n        let rowID = row[id]\n        let rowName = row[name]\n        let rowAge = row[age]\n\n        // Print or process the extracted data\n        print(\"ID: \\(rowID), Name: \\(rowName), Age: \\(rowAge)\")\n    }\n} catch {\n    // Handle any errors that may occur\n    print(\"An error occurred: \\(error)\")\n}\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Connection**: Establish a connection to your SQLite database using the `Connection` class.\n\n2. **Table and Columns**: Define the table and the specific columns you want to access using the `Table` and `Expression` classes from the SQLite.swift library.\n\n3. **Query Execution**: Use the `prepare` method to execute the query and iterate over the results.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage any potential issues that may arise during database access.\n\n### Recommended Libraries:\n\n- **SQLite.swift**: This is the library you're already using, which is highly recommended for Swift applications due to its type-safe and Swift-friendly interface.\n\nBy structuring your code in this manner, you not only make it more efficient but also improve readability and maintainability."
