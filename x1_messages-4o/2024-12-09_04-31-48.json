        "content": "The issue you're encountering is that the `pop` method in Python dictionaries expects a single key and not a list of keys. To remove multiple elements from a dictionary, you can iterate over a list of keys and use `pop` for each key. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\na = dict(aa='aaaa', bb='bbbbb', cc='ccccc', dd='dddd', ee='eeeee')\n\n# List of keys to remove\nkeys_to_remove = ['cc', 'dd']\n\n# Iterate over the list of keys and remove them from the dictionary\nfor key in keys_to_remove:\n    a.pop(key, None)  # Using None as the default value to avoid KeyError if key is not found\n\nprint(a)\n```\n\nThis code will remove the specified keys ('cc' and 'dd') from the dictionary `a`. The `pop(key, None)` ensures that if a key doesn't exist in the dictionary, no error will be raised. After executing this code, the dictionary `a` will only contain the keys that were not specified in `keys_to_remove`."
