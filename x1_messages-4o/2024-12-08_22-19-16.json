For example, given the list of activities:\n<ul>\n  <li>Hiking in the mountains</li>\n  <li>Painting portraits</li>\n  <li>Eating ice cream</li>\n  <li>Singing karaoke</li>\n</ul>\nI want to create a question like \"Which activity does not fit with the others?\" with the answer being \"Eating ice cream\". Can I use any Scala code to randomly select one activity from the list as the incorrect answer, and present the question in an interactive format using HTML and JavaScript?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can use Scala to dynamically generate a quiz question based on a list of activities and then use HTML and JavaScript to present it interactively. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n### Step 1: Generate the Question in Scala\n\nFirst, you'll need to write Scala code to randomly select one activity from the list as the incorrect answer and generate a question.\n\n```scala\nimport scala.util.Random\n\nobject QuizGenerator {\n  def generateQuestion(activities: List[String]): (String, String) = {\n    val incorrectAnswer = Random.shuffle(activities).head\n    val question = s\"Which activity does not fit with the others?\"\n    (question, incorrectAnswer)\n  }\n}\n\nval activities = List(\"Hiking in the mountains\", \"Painting portraits\", \"Eating ice cream\", \"Singing karaoke\")\nval (question, incorrectAnswer) = QuizGenerator.generateQuestion(activities)\n```\n\n### Step 2: Create HTML and JavaScript for Interactive Presentation\n\nNow, you can use HTML and JavaScript to present the question and allow the user to select an answer.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Quiz</title>\n    <style>\n        .activity-list {\n            list-style-type: none;\n            padding: 0;\n        }\n        .activity-list li {\n            cursor: pointer;\n            padding: 5px;\n            border: 1px solid #ccc;\n            margin: 5px 0;\n        }\n        .activity-list li:hover {\n            background-color: #f0f0f0;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<h2 id=\"question\">Which activity does not fit with the others?</h2>\n<ul class=\"activity-list\" id=\"activities\">\n</ul>\n\n<script>\n    const activities = [\"Hiking in the mountains\", \"Painting portraits\", \"Eating ice cream\", \"Singing karaoke\"];\n    const incorrectAnswer = \"Eating ice cream\"; // This would be generated by Scala\n\n    const activitiesList = document.getElementById('activities');\n    activities.forEach(activity => {\n        const li = document.createElement('li');\n        li.textContent = activity;\n        li.onclick = () => checkAnswer(activity);\n        activitiesList.appendChild(li);\n    });\n\n    function checkAnswer(selected) {\n        if (selected === incorrectAnswer) {\n            alert('Correct! The activity that does not fit is: ' + selected);\n        } else {\n            alert('Try again!');\n        }\n    }\n</script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Scala Code**: The Scala code generates a random incorrect answer from the list of activities. It returns the question and the incorrect answer.\n\n2. **HTML and JavaScript**: The HTML and JavaScript display the question and list of activities. When an activity is clicked, the `checkAnswer` function checks if it matches the incorrect answer and alerts the user accordingly.\n\n### Integration\n\nIn a real-world scenario, you might generate the quiz question on the server using Scala, pass the data to the client-side, and render it using the provided HTML and JavaScript.\n\nThis setup allows you to dynamically generate and present quiz questions based on the activities list using Scala, HTML, and JavaScript."
