        "content": "Can you create a complex mathematical puzzle that involves various logical reasoning steps and requires the use of advanced reasoning skills to solve? The puzzle should consist of several stages, each of which builds on the previous one and requires a different approach to solve. The solution should involve the use of a combination of mathematical concepts and logical deductions, and should be satisfying and elegant in its simplicity. \nFor example: \nStage 1: \n3 + 4 = 10 \n4 + 7 = 26 \n5 + 8 = 52 \n6 + 9 = ? \nStage 2: \n1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, ? \nIn Stage 1, the solution to the puzzle involves taking the first number in each equation, multiplying it by itself plus one, and then adding the second number multiplied by two. Thus, 3 x (3+1) + 4 x 2 = 10, 4 x (4+1) + 7 x 2 = 26, and so on. \nIn Stage 2, the solution involves adding the previous number to the current index and then squaring it. Thus, 1 + 1^2 = 2, 2 + 2^2 = 6, 4 + 3^2 = 13, and so on. \nCan you provide a similar puzzle with multiple stages that requires advanced reasoning skills to solve? Please provide the Ruby code for the solution."

        "content": "Certainly! Below is a multi-stage mathematical puzzle, along with the solution and corresponding Ruby code that illustrates the logic required to solve it.\n\n### Puzzle Description\n\n**Stage 1:**\n\nFind the pattern in the following sequence of operations:\n\n- \\(5 \\times 3 + 4 = 23\\)\n- \\(6 \\times 4 + 5 = 34\\)\n- \\(7 \\times 5 + 6 = 47\\)\n- \\(8 \\times 6 + 7 = ?\\)\n\n**Stage 2:**\n\nDetermine the next number in the sequence:\n\n- 2, 5, 10, 17, 26, ?\n\n**Stage 3:**\n\nSolve this logical reasoning problem:\n\nThe letters correspond to numbers based on a hidden pattern. Identify the number for each letter:\n\n- A = 1\n- B = 2\n- C = 4\n- D = 8\n- E = ?\n\n### Puzzle Solution\n\n**Stage 1 Solution:**\n\nThe pattern involves multiplying the first number by the second number and then adding the next consecutive number. Hence:\n\n- \\(8 \\times 6 + 7 = 55\\)\n\n**Stage 2 Solution:**\n\nThe sequence involves adding consecutive odd numbers:\n\n- \\(2 + 3 = 5\\)\n- \\(5 + 5 = 10\\)\n- \\(10 + 7 = 17\\)\n- \\(17 + 9 = 26\\)\n\nThe next number is \\(26 + 11 = 37\\).\n\n**Stage 3 Solution:**\n\nThe pattern doubles the number as you progress through the alphabet:\n\n- A = \\(2^0 = 1\\)\n- B = \\(2^1 = 2\\)\n- C = \\(2^2 = 4\\)\n- D = \\(2^3 = 8\\)\n\nTherefore, E = \\(2^4 = 16\\).\n\n### Ruby Code for Solution\n\nHere's the Ruby code that implements the solution logic for each stage:\n\n```ruby\n# Stage 1\ndef stage1_solution(a, b, c)\n  a * b + c\nend\n\nputs \"Stage 1: #{stage1_solution(8, 6, 7)}\" # Output: 55\n\n# Stage 2\ndef stage2_sequence(n)\n  sequence = [2]\n  (1...n).each do |i|\n    sequence << sequence.last + (2 * i + 1)\n  end\n  sequence\nend\n\nputs \"Stage 2: #{stage2_sequence(6)}\" # Output: [2, 5, 10, 17, 26, 37]\n\n# Stage 3\ndef stage3_value(letter)\n  ('A'..letter).each_with_index.reduce(0) do |_, (char, index)|\n    return 2**index if char == letter\n  end\nend\n\nputs \"Stage 3: #{stage3_value('E')}\" # Output: 16\n```\n\nThis code succinctly captures the logic needed to solve each stage of the puzzle. Each function corresponds to solving the respective stage of the puzzle, and the method calls demonstrate their usage."
