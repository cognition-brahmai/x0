I have implemented a solution using nested for loops as shown below:\n\n```python\nnewList = []\nfor x in l:\n  for y in x:\n    newList.append(float(y))\n```\n\nBut I am curious if this can be achieved using a nested list comprehension. I have tried the following:\n\n```python\n[float(y) for y in x for x in l]\n```\n\nHowever, this gives a result that is not as expected - a bunch of 100's with a sum of 2400. How can I solve this issue using nested list comprehension?"

        "content": "The issue with your current list comprehension is the order of the `for` clauses. In a nested list comprehension, the order of the `for` clauses should match the order of the loops in the equivalent nested for-loop. You need to iterate over the outer list first and then the inner list. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n```python\nnewList = [float(y) for x in l for y in x]\n```\n\nIn this list comprehension:\n\n1. `for x in l` iterates over each sublist in the list `l`.\n2. `for y in x` iterates over each element in the sublist `x`.\n3. `float(y)` converts each element to a float.\n\nThis should give you the desired flat list with all elements converted to floats."
