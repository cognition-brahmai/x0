        "content": "The issue you're facing is due to Python 2's default behavior of using ASCII as the default encoding for strings. When you use the `.format()` method, it attempts to convert the Unicode string to a byte string based on the default encoding, which is ASCII, and since the \"\u2265\" character is not part of ASCII, it raises a `UnicodeEncodeError`.\n\nTo handle this situation, you can explicitly specify the encoding to use when converting Unicode strings to byte strings. One way to resolve this issue is to encode the Unicode string before formatting it. However, a more straightforward approach in Python 2 is to ensure that the result of formatting remains a Unicode string.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to work correctly:\n\n```python\ns = u'\\u2265'\nprint s\nprint u\"{0}\".format(s)  # Ensure the format string is a Unicode string\n```\n\nBy prefixing the format string with `u`, you ensure that the output of the `.format()` method is a Unicode string, which can handle the \"\u2265\" character appropriately.\n\nIf you find yourself working with Unicode frequently in Python 2, you might also consider setting the default encoding to UTF-8 at the start of your script, although this is generally not recommended as it can lead to unexpected behavior in larger applications:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nreload(sys)\nsys.setdefaultencoding('utf-8')\n```\n\nHowever, the best long-term solution is to upgrade to Python 3, where Unicode handling is much more intuitive and robust. In Python 3, strings are Unicode by default, and such issues are less likely to occur."
