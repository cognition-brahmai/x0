        "content": "Yes, it's possible to run a Python script from inside IPython without specifying its full path, but you'll need to add the directory containing your script to the system's PATH or use a workaround to achieve this. Here are a few methods to do so:\n\n1. **Modify the `sys.path` in IPython**: You can add the directory containing your script to the `sys.path` list within IPython, and then use `%run` to execute the script.\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   sys.path.append('/path/to/your/script/directory')\n   ```\n\n   After this, you should be able to run:\n\n   ```shell\n   %run my_script.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a symbolic link**: If you're on a Unix-like system, you can create a symbolic link to your script in a directory that's already in your PATH or in the current working directory of your IPython session.\n\n   ```bash\n   ln -s /path/to/your/script/my_script.py /current/working/directory/\n   ```\n\n   This allows you to run:\n\n   ```shell\n   %run my_script.py\n   ```\n\n3. **Use an IPython extension**: You can write a small IPython extension that automatically adds certain directories to the path upon startup, which can be configured in your IPython profile.\n\n4. **IPython magic command**: Use a custom IPython magic command to handle the script running. This can be a bit more involved but offers flexibility.\n\n5. **Environment Variables**: You can set an environment variable that points to the directory of your script and then access it in your IPython session.\n\n   ```bash\n   export MY_SCRIPT_DIR=/path/to/your/script\n   ```\n\n   In IPython:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   script_dir = os.getenv('MY_SCRIPT_DIR')\n   sys.path.append(script_dir)\n   ```\n\n   Then:\n\n   ```shell\n   %run my_script.py\n   ```\n\nBy using one of these methods, you should be able to run your Python script within IPython without needing to specify its full path each time."
