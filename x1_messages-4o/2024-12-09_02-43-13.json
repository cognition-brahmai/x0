For instance, from the following HTML code: \n```html\n<div class=\"someClass\">\n    <a href=\"href\">\n        <img alt=\"some\" src=\"some\"/>\n    </a>\n</div>\n```"

        "content": "To extract the `src` attribute from an `img` tag using BeautifulSoup, you need to first locate the `img` tag within your HTML structure and then access its `src` attribute. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\nhtml_doc = '''\n<div class=\"someClass\">\n    <a href=\"href\">\n        <img alt=\"some\" src=\"some\"/>\n    </a>\n</div>\n'''\n\n# Parse the HTML document\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc, 'html.parser')\n\n# Find the img tag\nimg_tag = soup.find('img')\n\n# Get the src attribute\nsrc = img_tag['src']\n\nprint(src)\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n\n```\nsome\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. `BeautifulSoup` is used to parse the provided HTML document.\n2. The `soup.find('img')` method locates the first `img` tag in the HTML.\n3. Once the `img` tag is found, you can access its `src` attribute using `img_tag['src']`.\n\nMake sure you have BeautifulSoup installed in your environment. You can install it using pip if it's not already installed:\n\n```bash\npip install beautifulsoup4\n```"
