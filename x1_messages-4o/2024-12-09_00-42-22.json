However, I would like to know if it's possible to print more detailed information about the exception and the code that generated it. Addition of details like line numbers or stack traces would be extremely beneficial. Here's my current code:\n\n```python\nimport logging\ntry:\n    1/0\nexcept ZeroDivisionError as e:\n    logging.error(e)  # ERROR:root:division by zero\n```"

        "content": "To log detailed error information, including stack traces and line numbers, you can use the `logging` module in combination with the `traceback` module. The `traceback` module provides powerful utilities for extracting, formatting, and printing stack traces of Python programs. Here's how you can enhance your logging to include more detailed debug information:\n\n```python\nimport logging\nimport traceback\n\n# Configure logging to output to a file or console with a desired format\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n\ntry:\n    1/0\nexcept ZeroDivisionError as e:\n    # Log the detailed exception information including stack trace\n    logging.error(\"An error occurred: %s\", e, exc_info=True)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`logging.basicConfig`**: Configures the logging system to output messages with a specific format. Here, it includes the timestamp, the level of the log entry, and the message.\n- **`exc_info=True`**: This option in the `logging.error` call is crucial. When set to `True`, it appends the full traceback information to the log message. This includes the line number and stack trace, which is similar to what you see when an unhandled exception occurs.\n\nThis approach will provide you with a comprehensive log output that includes everything you need to debug the issue, like the line number where the error occurred and the stack trace leading up to the error."
