        "content": "The formula \\( E = mc^2 \\), introduced by Albert Einstein, signifies the equivalence of mass and energy. It tells us that mass can be converted into energy and vice versa. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the types of energy related to this formula and the concept of energy conservation:\n\n1. **Mass Energy**: This is the energy that is inherent in an object due to its mass. It highlights the potential energy stored within the mass itself, which can be released under certain conditions, such as nuclear reactions.\n\n2. **Kinetic Energy**: When considering particles or objects in motion, part of the energy can be expressed as kinetic energy. In the context of relativistic physics (when velocities approach the speed of light), the total energy includes both kinetic energy and rest mass energy.\n\n3. **Potential Energy**: This is the energy an object possesses due to its position in a field, like gravitational or electromagnetic fields. In the context of nuclear energy, the potential energy can be related to the forces holding the nucleus together.\n\n4. **Thermal Energy**: This is the energy related to the temperature of an object, which involves the kinetic energy of particles within the object. When mass is converted to energy, it can manifest as thermal energy, for example, in nuclear explosions or reactions.\n\n5. **Nuclear Energy**: This is a specific form of energy that comes from the nucleus of an atom. Nuclear reactions, such as fission or fusion, convert mass into energy according to \\( E = mc^2 \\).\n\n6. **Radiant Energy**: This is the energy carried by electromagnetic waves. When mass is converted to energy, it often releases radiant energy, as seen in the light and heat from the sun.\n\n7. **Chemical Energy**: Although typically much smaller compared to nuclear energy, chemical reactions also involve changes in energy due to changes in the electron configurations around atoms.\n\nEnergy conservation is a fundamental principle stating that within a closed system, the total energy remains constant over time. When mass is converted to energy or vice versa, the total energy, including all forms, remains constant, demonstrating the principle of conservation of energy."
