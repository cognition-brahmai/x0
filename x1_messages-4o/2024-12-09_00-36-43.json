The script runs just fine when I keep the SSH session open but as soon as I end the SSH session, I get an error message in the log file I created for the script. The error seems to be about not being able to connect to the display \"localhost:10.0\". This occurs because I'm closing my X11 SSH session. I am not using the show() command in my script but I am creating figures using the following commands:\n\n```python\nloglog()\nhist(list,x)\nylabel('y')\nxlabel('x')\nsavefig('%s_hist.ps' %source.name)\nclose()\n```\n\nThe script requires some initial input and I am running it in the background using:\n\n```python\npython scriptToRun.py << start>& logfile.log&\n```\n\nIs there any workaround for this issue or am I required to keep the SSH session open?"

        "content": "This issue occurs because Matplotlib is trying to use a display server to render the plots, which requires a graphical session. When you disconnect your SSH session, the display server becomes unavailable, hence the error. \n\nTo resolve this issue, you can switch Matplotlib to use a non-interactive backend that does not require a display server. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Specify the Backend in the Script:** Add this to the top of your script before importing `matplotlib.pyplot`:\n\n    ```python\n    import matplotlib\n    matplotlib.use('Agg')  # Use the 'Agg' backend for PNGs, PDFs, etc.\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    ```\n\n2. **Ensure to Use `plt` for Plotting:** Make sure all your plotting commands are prefixed with `plt`, for example:\n\n    ```python\n    plt.loglog()\n    plt.hist(list, x)\n    plt.ylabel('y')\n    plt.xlabel('x')\n    plt.savefig('%s_hist.ps' % source.name)\n    plt.close()\n    ```\n\n3. **Run the Script in the Background:** You can run your script in the background as you were doing, making sure to redirect standard input and output properly:\n\n    ```bash\n    nohup python scriptToRun.py < input_file > logfile.log 2>&1 &\n    ```\n\n   - `nohup` allows the process to continue running after you disconnect.\n   - Redirect `stderr` to `stdout` using `2>&1` so that all logs go to `logfile.log`.\n\nBy using the `Agg` backend, Matplotlib will render the plots without needing a GUI, allowing the script to run entirely in the background successfully."
