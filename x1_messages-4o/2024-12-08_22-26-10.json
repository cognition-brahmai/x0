The criteria for receiving the scholarship is that the person must be between the ages of 16-22, have a minimum GPA of 3.5, have completed at least 50 hours of community service, and have participated in at least one school club or sport. The data will be provided in a CSV format, containing the person's age, GPA, community service hours, and a list of their school club/sport participation. If they meet the criteria, the program should output \"Congratulations! You are eligible for a scholarship.\" If they do not meet the criteria, the program should output \"Sorry, you are not eligible for a scholarship.\""

        "content": "To create a Python program that checks if a person is eligible for a scholarship based on the given criteria, you can follow these steps. We'll make use of the `csv` module to read data from a CSV file. Here's a sample program that demonstrates how to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\ndef check_eligibility(age, gpa, community_service_hours, clubs_sports):\n    # Check age criteria\n    if not (16 <= age <= 22):\n        return False\n\n    # Check GPA criteria\n    if gpa < 3.5:\n        return False\n\n    # Check community service hours criteria\n    if community_service_hours < 50:\n        return False\n\n    # Check clubs/sports participation criteria\n    if not clubs_sports:\n        return False\n\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    # Assuming the CSV file has headers: 'Age', 'GPA', 'Community Service Hours', 'Clubs/Sports'\n    csv_file = 'applicants.csv'\n\n    with open(csv_file, mode='r') as file:\n        csv_reader = csv.DictReader(file)\n        \n        for row in csv_reader:\n            age = int(row['Age'])\n            gpa = float(row['GPA'])\n            community_service_hours = int(row['Community Service Hours'])\n            clubs_sports = row['Clubs/Sports'].strip()  # Check if there's any participation\n\n            if check_eligibility(age, gpa, community_service_hours, clubs_sports):\n                print(\"Congratulations! You are eligible for a scholarship.\")\n            else:\n                print(\"Sorry, you are not eligible for a scholarship.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **CSV Reading**: The `csv.DictReader` is used to read the CSV file, which allows us to access each field by its header name.\n\n2. **Eligibility Function**: The `check_eligibility` function checks if the provided data meets all the criteria:\n   - Age between 16 and 22.\n   - GPA of at least 3.5.\n   - At least 50 hours of community service.\n   - Participation in at least one school club or sport.\n\n3. **Main Function**: The main function reads the data from the CSV, checks each applicant's eligibility, and prints the appropriate message based on their eligibility status.\n\nMake sure to replace `'applicants.csv'` with the actual path to your CSV file containing the applicants' data. Ensure your CSV file has the appropriate headers (`Age`, `GPA`, `Community Service Hours`, `Clubs/Sports`) for the program to work correctly."
