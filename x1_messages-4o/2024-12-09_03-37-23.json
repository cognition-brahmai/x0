I want to add a new column called \"is_rich\" that indicates whether a person is rich based on their salary. I have found three methods to accomplish this task, but I am unsure which method is the best. Are all these methods equally good or is there a preferred way to add a column based on a condition in pandas dataframe?\n\nCode for creating dataframe:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\nd = {'age' : [21, 45, 45, 5],\n     'salary' : [20, 40, 10, 100]}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(d)\n```\nMethods to add the \"is_rich\" column:\n```python\n# method 1\ndf['is_rich_method1'] = np.where(df['salary']>=50, 'yes', 'no')\n\n# method 2\ndf['is_rich_method2'] = ['yes' if x >= 50 else 'no' for x in df['salary']]\n\n# method 3\ndf['is_rich_method3'] = 'no'\ndf.loc[df['salary'] > 50,'is_rich_method3'] = 'yes'\n```"

        "content": "All three methods you've provided for adding the \"is_rich\" column to the DataFrame are valid and will produce the desired output. However, there are some differences between them in terms of performance and readability:\n\n1. **Method 1**: Using `np.where`\n   - **Performance**: This method is vectorized, which means it's typically faster and more efficient for large datasets.\n   - **Readability**: It's concise and easy to understand for those familiar with NumPy.\n   - **Preferred Use**: Best when performance is a concern, especially with large DataFrames.\n\n2. **Method 2**: List comprehension\n   - **Performance**: This method is generally slower than the vectorized approach because it operates on one element at a time.\n   - **Readability**: It is quite readable and intuitive for those familiar with Python's list comprehensions.\n   - **Preferred Use**: Suitable for small to medium-sized DataFrames where readability is a priority over performance.\n\n3. **Method 3**: Using `DataFrame.loc`\n   - **Performance**: It's also vectorized and performs well.\n   - **Readability**: This approach is very clear, especially for those familiar with pandas indexing.\n   - **Preferred Use**: Good choice when you want to modify multiple conditions or columns simultaneously, and it's a commonly used pandas approach.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- For large datasets, **Method 1** or **Method 3** are preferred due to their efficiency.\n- For simplicity and readability with smaller datasets, any method is acceptable, but **Method 2** might be more intuitive for those new to pandas.\n\nIn general, when working with pandas, vectorized operations are preferred due to their efficiency. Therefore, **Method 1** and **Method 3** are often recommended."
