I have been using the following code:\n\n```python\n__version_info__ = ('2013','03','14')\n__version__ = '-'.join(__version_info__)\n...\nparser.add_argument('-V', '--version', action='version', version=\"%(prog)s (\"+__version__+\")\")\n```\nBut I would like to know if this is the best practice or if there are other preferred ways."

        "content": "The method you've used for specifying the program name and version information within `argparse` in Python is quite standard and effective. However, there are a few improvements you could consider for clarity and maintainability:\n\n1. **Use `argparse`'s `version` action**: You are already doing this, which is great. The `version` action automatically handles the `-V` and `--version` flags and prints the version string you provide.\n\n2. **String Formatting**: You can use f-strings for more readable and Pythonic string formatting (if you're using Python 3.6 or later):\n\n    ```python\n    __version_info__ = ('2013','03','14')\n    __version__ = '-'.join(__version_info__)\n\n    import argparse\n\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=\"Your Program Description\")\n    parser.add_argument('-V', '--version', action='version', version=f\"%(prog)s {__version__}\")\n    ```\n\n3. **Semantic Versioning**: If applicable, consider using semantic versioning (e.g., `1.0.0`) for clarity on the nature of updates. This is especially useful if the program is intended for broader distribution or open-source projects.\n\n4. **Centralized Version Information**: Keep version information centralized, preferably in a place where it can be easily accessed by other parts of your program or setup scripts, like in a `__init__.py` file for a package.\n\n5. **Additional Metadata**: If you have additional metadata (author, license, etc.), consider extending your `argparse` configuration to include these in your help or version output.\n\nWhat you have is already a solid implementation, and these considerations are more about enhancing readability, maintainability, and standardization."
