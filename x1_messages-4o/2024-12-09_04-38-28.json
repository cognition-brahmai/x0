I've tried to replace 'N/A' values with NaN in my dataframe, but it's throwing a warning because it's working on a copy of the dataframe. Here's the code I tried:\n\n```python\nmydata = {'x' : [10, 50, 18, 32, 47, 20], 'y' : ['12', '11', 'N/A', '13', '15', 'N/A']}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(mydata)\n\ndf[df.y == 'N/A']['y'] = np.nan\n```\n\nI've seen solutions using iloc or ix but I need to use a boolean condition in this case. What is the correct way to handle this?"

        "content": "The warning you're encountering is likely a `SettingWithCopyWarning`, which occurs when you're trying to modify a subset of a DataFrame that might be a view rather than a copy. This happens because the operation `df[df.y == 'N/A']['y'] = np.nan` first creates a temporary DataFrame (a view), and you're trying to modify it directly.\n\nTo resolve this, you can use the `loc` method to set the values directly on the original DataFrame. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\nmydata = {'x': [10, 50, 18, 32, 47, 20], 'y': ['12', '11', 'N/A', '13', '15', 'N/A']}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(mydata)\n\n# Use .loc to replace 'N/A' with NaN\ndf.loc[df.y == 'N/A', 'y'] = np.nan\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nThis method modifies the DataFrame in place without generating a warning because `loc` directly accesses the DataFrame and makes changes to it."
