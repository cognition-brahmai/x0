        "content": "To solve the problem of finding the maximum sum of non-adjacent elements in an array, we can use a dynamic programming approach. The idea is to maintain an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum sum we can achieve using elements from the start of the array up to the `i-th` element, without picking adjacent elements.\n\nHere's a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\ndef max_non_adjacent_sum(nums):\n    if not nums:\n        return 0\n    elif len(nums) == 1:\n        return nums[0]\n\n    # Initialize an array to store the maximum sums\n    dp = [0] * len(nums)\n\n    # Base cases\n    dp[0] = max(0, nums[0])  # We can choose the first element or not\n    dp[1] = max(dp[0], nums[1])  # Choose the maximum of the first two elements\n\n    # Fill the dp array\n    for i in range(2, len(nums)):\n        # Either take the current element and add it to the best sum excluding the previous element,\n        # or ignore the current element and take the maximum sum up to the previous element\n        dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], nums[i] + dp[i-2])\n\n    # The last element of dp will have the result\n    return dp[-1]\n\n# Test the function\nnums = [5, 1, 1, 5, 2, 6, 7, 1]\nprint(\"Maximum sum of non-adjacent elements:\", max_non_adjacent_sum(nums))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Base Cases:**\n   - If the array is empty, the maximum sum is 0.\n   - If the array has only one element, the maximum sum is that element itself.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`):**\n   - `dp[0]` is initialized to the maximum of 0 or the first element since we can choose to include the first element or not.\n   - `dp[1]` is the maximum of the first or second element because we cannot choose both.\n\n3. **Filling the `dp` Array:**\n   - For each element from the third onward, decide whether to include the current element in the sum or not.\n   - If included, add it to the sum at `i-2` (to ensure non-adjacency) and compare it with the sum at `i-1` (excluding the current element).\n\n4. **Result:**\n   - The last value in the `dp` array contains the maximum sum of non-adjacent elements.\n\nThis solution runs in O(n) time and uses O(n) space, where n is the number of elements in the array."
