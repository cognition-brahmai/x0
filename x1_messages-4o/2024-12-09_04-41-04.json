        "content": "The use of camelCase in `unittest2` (and its predecessor, `unittest`) is primarily for historical reasons, as it was originally based on JUnit, a Java testing framework where camelCase is the convention. When `unittest` was first implemented in Python, it adopted the naming conventions from JUnit, including camelCase method names. This was before PEP 8 became widely adopted as the standard for Python code style.\n\nBy the time PEP 8 was established and became the norm, `unittest` was already widely used, and changing the method names to adhere to PEP 8 would have broken backward compatibility for a large number of existing test suites. Even with the introduction of Python 3, maintaining backward compatibility with earlier versions was still a priority for many users. As a result, the camelCase method names were retained.\n\nHowever, Python developers are encouraged to use PEP 8 conventions in their own code. When extending or creating new testing frameworks, it's recommended to use lowercase with underscores for method names to align with modern Python style guidelines."
