While Excel itself doesn't have a built-in Thesaurus function like some word processors, you can still generate synonyms for \"befuddled\" by using external resources or manually entering them. Here are three synonyms for the word \"befuddled\":\n\n1. Confused\n2. Perplexed\n3. Baffled\n\nYou can manually enter these synonyms into your Excel table next to the word \"befuddled.\" If you're frequently needing synonyms, consider using online thesaurus tools or integrating a macro that can fetch synonyms from an online source."
