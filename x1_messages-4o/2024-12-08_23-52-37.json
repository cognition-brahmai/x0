        "content": "For a summer event, you\u2019ll want something light, breathable, and stylish. Here are a few options that might suit a size 12:\n\n1. **Floral Maxi Dress**: A flowy maxi dress in a light fabric like cotton or linen with a floral print can be both comfortable and elegant. Look for a style with a defined waist and adjustable straps for a flattering fit.\n\n2. **A-Line Sundress**: An A-line dress in a bright, summery color or pattern can be very flattering. Choose a dress with a slight flare from the waist to allow for easy movement and comfort.\n\n3. **Off-Shoulder Midi Dress**: An off-shoulder midi dress can add a touch of elegance while keeping you cool. Opt for a dress with a ruffled neckline or puff sleeves for added style.\n\n4. **Wrap Dress**: A wrap dress is universally flattering and can be adjusted to fit comfortably. Choose one in a light fabric with an eye-catching print or color.\n\n5. **Shift Dress**: For a more relaxed look, a shift dress in a breathable fabric can be perfect. Pair it with statement accessories to dress it up or down.\n\n6. **Linen Shirt Dress**: A linen shirt dress can be both chic and comfortable. It\u2019s perfect for a more casual summer event and can be styled with a belt to accentuate the waist.\n\nConsider accessorizing with a wide-brimmed hat, statement jewelry, or a light shawl for when it gets cooler in the evening. Don't forget comfortable sandals or wedges to complete the look!"
