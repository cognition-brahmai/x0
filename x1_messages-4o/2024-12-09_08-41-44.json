        "content": "How do I copy weights from one model to another using Keras from Tensorflow 1.4.1? I am trying to implement a deep-q network (DQN) for Atari games. The implementation uses two networks, Q and Q'. The weights of Q are trained using gradient descent, and then the weights are copied periodically to Q'. I have posted the code that I am using to build Q and Q', as well as my method for copying weights, but my DQN implementation is failing. Is there a correct way to copy weights from one network to another?\n\nHere's how I build Q and Q':\n\n```python\nACT_SIZE   = 4\nLEARN_RATE = 0.0025\nOBS_SIZE   = 128\n\ndef buildModel():\n  model = tf.keras.models.Sequential()\n\n  model.add(tf.keras.layers.Lambda(lambda x: x / 255.0, input_shape=OBS_SIZE))\n  model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation=\"relu\"))\n  model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation=\"relu\"))\n  model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(ACT_SIZE, activation=\"linear\"))\n  opt = tf.keras.optimizers.RMSprop(lr=LEARN_RATE)\n\n  model.compile(loss=\"mean_squared_error\", optimizer=opt)\n\n  return model\n```\nThis is my method for copying weights:\n\n```python\ndef updateTargetModel(model, targetModel):\n  modelWeights       = model.trainable_weights\n  targetModelWeights = targetModel.trainable_weights\n\n  for i in range(len(targetModelWeights)):\n    targetModelWeights[i].assign(modelWeights[i])\n```\nI have seen other questions on how to save and load weights to and from disk and how to load weights from individual layers, but I need to copy the entire model's weights."

        "content": "In TensorFlow 1.4.1 with Keras, the method you are using to copy weights between models can be improved for better compatibility and efficiency. The approach you have with `assign` is not directly applicable in TensorFlow 1.x, as `assign` is used in TensorFlow 2.x eager execution. Instead, you should use the `set_weights` method provided by Keras, which is specifically designed for this purpose.\n\nHere's how you can modify your `updateTargetModel` function to copy weights correctly:\n\n```python\ndef updateTargetModel(model, targetModel):\n    # Get weights from the source model\n    modelWeights = model.get_weights()\n    # Set these weights to the target model\n    targetModel.set_weights(modelWeights)\n```\n\nThis method uses `get_weights()` to retrieve the weights from the source model and `set_weights()` to apply them to the target model. This approach is straightforward and works effectively in TensorFlow 1.x with Keras.\n\nAdditionally, ensure that both models have the same architecture before copying weights. Otherwise, the weight dimensions won't match, and you'll encounter errors.\n\nFinally, since you are working with TensorFlow 1.4.1, make sure that your TensorFlow session is properly initialized and that the graphs are managed correctly. If you upgrade to a newer version of TensorFlow, many of these issues are managed automatically due to the eager execution in TensorFlow 2.x, where operations are executed immediately."
