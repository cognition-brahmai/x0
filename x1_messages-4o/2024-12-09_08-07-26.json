        "content": "Your current function is always returning `True` because the `find` method in MongoDB returns a cursor object, which is always truthy even if it doesn't find any documents. To fix this, you should check if the cursor contains any documents by using the `count()` method or by converting the cursor to a list and checking its length. Additionally, you should ensure that `newID` is a list if you are using the `$in` operator, or adjust the query accordingly if `newID` is a single value.\n\nHere's an updated version of your function:\n\n```python\ndef alreadyExists(newID):\n    # Ensure newID is a list if you intend to use $in operator\n    if not isinstance(newID, list):\n        newID = [newID]\n\n    # Use `find_one` to return a single document if it exists\n    result = db.mycollection.find_one({'UserIDS': {\"$in\": newID}})\n    \n    if result:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n\nThis function uses `find_one` to check if there is at least one document that matches the query. If such a document is found, `find_one` returns it, which is truthy, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `None`, and the function returns `False`. This should resolve the issue you're encountering."
