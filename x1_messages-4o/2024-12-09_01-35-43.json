        "content": "What is the relationship and difference between IPython and Jupyter Console? I have always thought that 'ipython notebook' is the same as 'jupyter notebook' and 'ipython' shell is just an alias of 'jupyter console'. However, I realized that 'ipython' does not have 'connect_info' magic defined and thus cannot be connected to different backends. I have the following components installed in my conda:\n```\nipython                   6.1.0                    py36_0    defaults\njupyter                   1.0.0                    py36_4    defaults\njupyter_client            5.2.3                    py36_0    defaults\njupyter_console           5.2.0            py36he59e554_1    defaults\njupyter_contrib_core      0.3.3                    py36_1    conda-forge\njupyter_contrib_nbextensions 0.5.0                    py36_0    conda-forge\njupyter_core              4.4.0            py36h7c827e3_0    defaults\n```\nWhat is the relation between 'ipython' of this version and 'jupyter console' of this version? Does the 'ipython notebook' (deprecated as in 'ipython 6.1.0') share any components with 'jupyter' libraries, or is 'ipython notebook' still self-contained? Do 'ipython' and 'jupyter' have any dependencies?"

        "content": "The relationship between IPython and Jupyter Console, as well as their differences, can be traced back to their origins and the evolution of the Jupyter project. Here's a breakdown of their relationship and differences:\n\n### Relationship and Evolution:\n\n1. **IPython:** \n   - Originally, IPython was both a powerful interactive Python shell and a notebook interface.\n   - It provided enhanced features like easy debugging, tab completion, and more interactive capabilities than the standard Python shell.\n\n2. **Jupyter:**\n   - The Jupyter project evolved from IPython, where \"Jupyter\" stands for \"Julia, Python, and R\", highlighting its language-agnostic approach.\n   - The notebook component of IPython was split into its own project under the Jupyter umbrella, leading to the creation of Jupyter Notebook.\n\n3. **IPython vs Jupyter Console:**\n   - **IPython Shell:** Remains as the interactive Python shell with advanced features for Python users.\n   - **Jupyter Console:** A terminal-based console for Jupyter kernels, which can connect to different backends (not limited to Python).\n\n### Differences:\n\n- **Purpose:**\n  - **IPython:** Primarily designed for Python users seeking an enhanced interactive shell experience.\n  - **Jupyter Console:** Allows for interaction with Jupyter kernels from the terminal, supporting multiple languages.\n\n- **Functionality:**\n  - **IPython Shell:** Does not support the `connect_info` magic because it is specifically tailored for Python.\n  - **Jupyter Console:** Supports various Jupyter kernels and can connect to remote kernels with `connect_info`.\n\n- **Language Support:**\n  - **IPython:** Only supports Python.\n  - **Jupyter Console:** Supports any language for which there is a Jupyter kernel available.\n\n### Dependencies and Components:\n\n- **IPython and Jupyter:** \n  - Since the split, IPython and Jupyter have separate roles, but IPython is still used as the default kernel for Jupyter Notebooks.\n  - Both share underlying components like `jupyter_client` for kernel communication.\n\n- **IPython Notebook vs Jupyter Notebook:**\n  - The term \"IPython Notebook\" is deprecated. The functionality is now encapsulated within Jupyter Notebook.\n  - Jupyter Notebook is not self-contained and relies on several Jupyter components (`jupyter_core`, `jupyter_client`, etc.) for its operation.\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **IPython** provides an enhanced interactive Python experience.\n- **Jupyter Console** is a versatile terminal-based interface for interacting with multiple language kernels.\n- **Jupyter Notebook** is the evolution of IPython Notebook and supports various languages and kernels through the Jupyter ecosystem.\n- While IPython and Jupyter have diverged in their specific roles, they are still part of a larger ecosystem that allows for versatile and interactive computing experiences across different languages."
