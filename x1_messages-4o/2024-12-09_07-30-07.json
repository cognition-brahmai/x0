This script serves as the command-line utility for your Django project and allows you to manage various aspects of the project, including running the development server, database migrations, and more.\n\nTo set up a Debug configuration in PyCharm Community Edition, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Open your Django project in PyCharm.**\n\n2. **Go to 'Run' > 'Edit Configurations'.**\n\n3. **Click the '+' button to add a new configuration and select 'Python'.**\n\n4. **Configure the following settings:**\n   - **Name:** Give your configuration a meaningful name, like \"Django Server\".\n   - **Script path:** Browse and select the `manage.py` file in your Django project.\n   - **Parameters:** Enter the command you want to run. For starting the development server, use `runserver`. If you want to specify a port, you can add it here, e.g., `runserver 8000`.\n   - **Python interpreter:** Ensure you have the correct Python interpreter selected, the one associated with your Django project's virtual environment.\n   - **Working directory:** Set this to the root directory of your Django project where `manage.py` is located.\n\n5. **Apply the configuration and click 'OK'.**\n\n6. **To start debugging, select your newly created configuration from the dropdown in the top-right corner of PyCharm and click the Debug icon (a green bug).**\n\nThis setup will allow you to start your Django development server in debug mode, enabling breakpoints and other debugging features provided by PyCharm."
