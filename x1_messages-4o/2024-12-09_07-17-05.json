        "content": "In matplotlib, I'm trying to understand the 4-element tuple argument for 'bbox_to_anchor'. In the \"Legend location\" section of the \"Legend guide\" in the matplotlib website, there's a script where line 9 is `plt.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(0., 1.02, 1., .102), loc=3, ncol=2, mode=\"expand\", borderaxespad=0.)`. Usually, I've seen tuples passed to `bbox_to_anchor` with 2 elements, but this one has 4. What does each element represent if the tuple passed has 4 elements? In the `pyplot.legend` docs, it mentioned about `bbox_transform` coordinates. I found `matplotlib.transforms.Bbox` with a `static from_bounds(x0, y0, width, height)`. Is the setup for the 4-tuple parameter based on this `from_bounds`? I tried changing some values and it seemed to make sense, but when I changed `.102` to `0.9`, the legend didn't change. Why is this happening?"

        "content": "In Matplotlib, the `bbox_to_anchor` argument is used to specify the bounding box for the legend. When it's a 4-element tuple, it represents a bounding box defined by `from_bounds(x0, y0, width, height)`, which matches the functionality provided by `matplotlib.transforms.Bbox.from_bounds`.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what each element represents:\n\n1. **x0**: The x-coordinate of the lower-left corner of the bounding box.\n2. **y0**: The y-coordinate of the lower-left corner of the bounding box.\n3. **width**: The width of the bounding box.\n4. **height**: The height of the bounding box.\n\nThis 4-tuple is used to define a rectangle in the coordinate system specified by `bbox_transform`. By default, `bbox_transform` is set to `ax.transAxes`, which means the bounding box coordinates are interpreted relative to the axes.\n\nNow, regarding why the legend didn't change when you altered the `.102` height to `0.9`, there are a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Mode \"expand\"**: When you use `mode=\"expand\"`, the legend is expanded to fill the bounding box horizontally, which can override some manual settings of the bounding box. This could affect how changes to the height are rendered.\n\n2. **Legend content and layout**: If the content of the legend doesn't require much vertical space, increasing the height of the bounding box might not have a visible effect. The layout of the legend is computed based on the legend's contents and the space they require.\n\n3. **Clipping and limits**: If the legend is placed outside the axes or figure bounds, changes might not be visible due to clipping, especially if the figure or axes limits don't accommodate the new size.\n\nTo see the effect of changing the bounding box height, try adjusting the other parameters, such as the width, and ensure that `mode` does not conflict with your desired layout. Also, consider visualizing the bounding box by drawing a rectangle using the `Rectangle` patch to understand how it aligns with the legend."
