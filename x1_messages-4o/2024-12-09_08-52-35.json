        "content": "To handle errors for negative numbers in a factorial calculator, you need to check if the input is negative and raise an error or return a message indicating that factorials for negative numbers are undefined. Here is an example of how you can modify your code to include this error handling in Python:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\")\n    elif n == 0 or n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        result = 1\n        for i in range(2, n + 1):\n            result *= i\n        return result\n\ntry:\n    number = int(input(\"Enter a number to calculate its factorial: \"))\n    print(f\"The factorial of {number} is {factorial(number)}\")\nexcept ValueError as ve:\n    print(ve)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Input Check**: The `factorial` function checks if the input `n` is negative. If it is, a `ValueError` is raised with an appropriate message.\n\n2. **Error Handling**: The `try-except` block is used to catch the `ValueError` when a negative number is entered, allowing the program to inform the user without crashing.\n\n3. **Factorial Calculation**: If the input is valid (non-negative), the function proceeds to calculate the factorial using a loop.\n\nBy adding this error handling, your factorial calculator becomes more robust and user-friendly."
