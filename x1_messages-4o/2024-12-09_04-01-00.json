I have tried using parquet-tools on my Mac but the data output did not look correct. I need the output to have NULL values for columns where data is not present (empty column between 2 commas for the CSV). I am seeking a simple and minimalistic solution because I need to automate everything and I don't have many resources."

        "content": "To convert a Parquet file to a CSV file without using Apache Spark, you can use the `pandas` library in Python. The `pandas` library provides a convenient way to read Parquet files and write them to CSV. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can achieve this:\n\n### Step 1: Install Required Libraries\n\nFirst, you'll need to install `pandas` and `pyarrow`, as `pyarrow` is used by `pandas` to read Parquet files.\n\n```bash\npip install pandas pyarrow\n```\n\n### Step 2: Convert Parquet to CSV\n\nHere's a simple script to read a Parquet file and write it to a CSV file, ensuring that NULL values are represented correctly in the CSV:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Define the file paths\nparquet_file_path = 'input_file.parquet'\ncsv_file_path = 'output_file.csv'\n\n# Read the Parquet file\ndf = pd.read_parquet(parquet_file_path)\n\n# Write the DataFrame to a CSV file\ndf.to_csv(csv_file_path, index=False, na_rep='')\n\nprint(f\"Parquet file has been converted to CSV and saved as {csv_file_path}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Reading the Parquet File**: `pd.read_parquet(parquet_file_path)` reads the Parquet file into a pandas DataFrame.\n  \n- **Writing to CSV**: `df.to_csv(csv_file_path, index=False, na_rep='')` writes the DataFrame to a CSV file. The `index=False` argument ensures that the DataFrame index is not written as a column in the CSV file. The `na_rep=''` argument ensures that any NULL values are written as empty strings in the CSV, which results in empty columns between commas.\n\n### Automation\n\nTo automate this process, you can wrap the above script in a function and call it whenever needed. You can also use a task scheduler to run the script at specific intervals or integrate it into a larger workflow.\n\nThis approach should work efficiently for Parquet files that fit into memory. If you're dealing with very large files that don't fit into memory, you might need to consider a more memory-efficient approach, like processing the file in chunks. However, for most use cases, especially when resources are limited, this pandas-based solution should be sufficient."
