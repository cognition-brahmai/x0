        "content": "To move a column by its name to the front in a pandas DataFrame, you can use the following approach. This method involves rearranging the columns by specifying the desired order explicitly:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Creating the DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'Net': ['0%', '0%', '2%', '1%'],\n    'Upper': ['0.22%', '0.32%', '2.45%', '1.63%'],\n    'Lower': ['-0.12%', '-0.19%', '1.10%', '-0.40%'],\n    'Mid': [2, 3, 4, 6],\n    'Zscore': [65, 45, 78, 65]\n}\n\nindex = ['More than once a day', 'Once a day', 'Several times a week', 'Once a week']\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data, index=index)\n\n# Reordering columns\ncolumns = ['Mid'] + [col for col in df.columns if col != 'Mid']\ndf = df[columns]\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nHere's what the code does:\n\n1. **DataFrame Creation**: It first creates the DataFrame using the given data.\n2. **Reordering Columns**: It constructs a new list of columns where 'Mid' is placed at the front, followed by the rest of the columns. This is done using a list comprehension to ensure that 'Mid' is the first column.\n3. **Reindexing**: It reindexes the DataFrame using the new column order.\n\nThis will give you the desired output with the \"Mid\" column at the front."
