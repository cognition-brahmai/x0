        "content": "Certainly! The sequence you've provided is: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, __.\n\nThis sequence is a geometric progression where each term after the first is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a constant factor. In this case, the factor is 2. \n\nTo derive a mathematical rule for this sequence, let's observe the sequence:\n\n- The first term is \\(2^1 = 2\\).\n- The second term is \\(2^2 = 4\\).\n- The third term is \\(2^3 = 8\\).\n- The fourth term is \\(2^4 = 16\\).\n- The fifth term is \\(2^5 = 32\\).\n- The sixth term is \\(2^6 = 64\\).\n\nFrom this pattern, it is clear that the \\(n\\)-th term of the sequence can be expressed as \\(2^n\\), where \\(n\\) is a positive integer starting from 1.\n\nTo find the next element in this sequence, we just need to determine the next power of 2:\n\n- The seventh term will be \\(2^7 = 128\\).\n\nTherefore, the next element in the sequence is 128.\n\nThe general formula for the \\(n\\)-th term of this sequence is:\n\n\\[ a_n = 2^n \\]\n\nwhere \\(a_n\\) represents the \\(n\\)-th term in the sequence."
