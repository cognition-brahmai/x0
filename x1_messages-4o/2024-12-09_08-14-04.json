        "content": "To extract just the filename without the file suffix and path from a given file path in Bash, you can use various command-line tools like `basename`, combined with parameter expansion. Here's one way to do it using parameter expansion:\n\n```bash\nfilepath=\"/foo/fizzbuzz.bar\"\nfilename=$(basename \"$filepath\")\nfilename_without_extension=\"${filename%.*}\"\necho \"$filename_without_extension\"\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of how this works:\n\n1. `basename \"$filepath\"` extracts the filename with the extension from the full path. In this case, it results in `fizzbuzz.bar`.\n\n2. `filename_without_extension=\"${filename%.*}\"` uses parameter expansion to remove the extension from the filename. The `%.*` removes the shortest match of `.*` from the end of the string, effectively stripping off the file extension, leaving you with just `fizzbuzz`.\n\nWhen you run this script, it will output `fizzbuzz`, which is the filename without its extension."
