The usual method of setting the `fontweight` to \"bold\" does not seem to work.

        "content": "To set the title of a Matplotlib figure to bold using the \"Times New Roman\" font, you can use Matplotlib's `rcParams` to customize the font properties globally or use the `fontdict` parameter in the `plt.title()` function. The issue you're encountering may be due to the font not supporting the bold weight directly. Here\u2019s how you can ensure the title is bold with the specified font:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Option 1: Using fontdict in plt.title\nplt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])\ntitle_font = {'fontname': 'Times New Roman', 'fontweight': 'bold'}\nplt.title(\"Test\", **title_font)\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIf the above does not work as expected, it might be due to the specific font file being used. In some cases, you may need to ensure that the bold version of the \"Times New Roman\" font is available on your system.\n\nAdditionally, you can try setting the font properties globally using `rcParams`:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Option 2: Using rcParams\nplt.rcParams['font.family'] = 'Times New Roman'\nplt.rcParams['font.weight'] = 'bold'\n\nplt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])\nplt.title(\"Test\")\nplt.show()\n```\n\nMake sure the \"Times New Roman\" font is installed on your system, and you may need to specify the path to the font file if necessary. If you still face issues, consider using a different font that supports bold weight or manually verifying if the necessary font files are properly configured in your environment."
