After running this script, the CSV file includes additional rows for Max, Min, and Average. Now, I want to update the CSV file by adding a new build and redoing the Max, Min, and Average rows. To do this, I am trying to delete these rows, add the new row, and then recompute the stats. I am trying to use the drop function to delete the rows, for example, df = df.drop('Max'). However, I am encountering an error: \"ValueError: labels ['Max'] not contained in axis\". I created the CSV files using Sublime Text, could this be part of the issue? I have two questions: \n\n1. How can I fix this issue with the drop function? \n2. Alternatively, is there another method to add more builds and update the statistics without using the drop function?\n\nHere is my CSV file:\n\n```\nindex,Avg,Min,Max\nBuild1,56.19,39.123,60.1039\nBuild2,57.11,40.102,60.2\nBuild3,55.1134,35.129404123,60.20121\nMax,57.11,40.102,60.20121\nMin,55.1134,35.129404123,60.1039\nAverage,56.1378,38.1181347077,60.16837\n```\n\nAnd here is my script:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('newdata.csv')\nprint(df)\n\ndf_out = pd.concat([df.set_index('index'),df.set_index('index').agg(['max','min','mean'])]).rename(index={'max':'Max','min':'Min','mean':'Average'}).reset_index()\n\nwith open('newdata.csv', 'w') as f:\n    df_out.to_csv(f,index=False)\n```"

        "content": "To resolve the issue and achieve your goal of updating the CSV file with a new build and recalculating the statistics, let's address both of your questions.\n\n### 1. Fixing the Drop Function Issue\n\nThe error \"ValueError: labels ['Max'] not contained in axis\" occurs because the `drop()` function is looking for an index label named 'Max' in the DataFrame. However, in your case, 'Max', 'Min', and 'Average' are part of the index, not column labels. You need to specify the axis along which you want to drop these rows. Here's how you can fix it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read the CSV file\ndf = pd.read_csv('newdata.csv')\n\n# Drop the Max, Min, and Average rows by specifying the index\ndf = df.set_index('index')\ndf = df.drop(['Max', 'Min', 'Average'], axis=0)\n\n# Add the new build here (for example, adding Build4)\nnew_build = {'Avg': 58.0, 'Min': 41.0, 'Max': 61.0}  # replace with actual values\ndf.loc['Build4'] = new_build\n\n# Recalculate the statistics\nstats = df.agg(['max', 'min', 'mean']).rename(index={'max': 'Max', 'min': 'Min', 'mean': 'Average'})\n\n# Append the statistics to the DataFrame\ndf_out = pd.concat([df, stats])\n\n# Save the updated DataFrame to the CSV file\ndf_out.to_csv('newdata.csv', index_label='index')\n```\n\n### 2. Alternative Method Without Using Drop\n\nIf you prefer not to use the `drop` function, you can directly filter out the rows that you want to remove and then proceed with adding new builds and recalculating the statistics:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read the CSV file\ndf = pd.read_csv('newdata.csv')\n\n# Filter out the Max, Min, and Average rows\ndf = df[~df['index'].isin(['Max', 'Min', 'Average'])]\n\n# Add the new build here (for example, adding Build4)\nnew_build = {'Avg': 58.0, 'Min': 41.0, 'Max': 61.0}  # replace with actual values\ndf = df.append(pd.DataFrame([new_build], index=['Build4']))\n\n# Recalculate the statistics\nstats = df.agg(['max', 'min', 'mean']).rename(index={'max': 'Max', 'min': 'Min', 'mean': 'Average'})\n\n# Append the statistics to the DataFrame\ndf_out = pd.concat([df, stats])\n\n# Save the updated DataFrame to the CSV file\ndf_out.to_csv('newdata.csv', index_label='index')\n```\n\nIn both methods, make sure to replace the placeholders for the new build values with actual data you want to add. This approach ensures that your CSV file is consistently updated with the new builds and recalculated statistics."
