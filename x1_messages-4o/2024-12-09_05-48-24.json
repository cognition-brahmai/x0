        "content": "The issue you're experiencing stems from the fact that when you use `exec` within a function or method, like `__init__` in your class, the names defined in the `exec` statement are not automatically added to the local or global scope of that function. Instead, they are confined to the local scope of the `exec` call itself.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to explicitly specify the scope in which you want the `exec` call to execute. You can achieve this by using a dictionary to capture the local variables defined by the `exec`. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\na = '''\ndef x():\n    print(42)\n'''\n\nclass Test:\n    def __init__(self):\n        local_scope = {}\n        exec(a, globals(), local_scope)\n        local_scope['x']()\n\nt = Test()\n```\n\nIn this code snippet:\n\n- We create a dictionary `local_scope` to capture the local variables defined by the `exec` call.\n- We execute `exec(a, globals(), local_scope)`, which allows the function `x` to be defined within the `local_scope`.\n- We then call the function `x` using `local_scope['x']()`.\n\nThis should resolve the `NameError` you were encountering and allow you to call the `x` function successfully."
