        "content": "In Python's `pdb`, there isn't a direct equivalent to gdb's watchpoints where you can monitor a variable for changes automatically. However, you can achieve similar functionality using a few different techniques:\n\n1. **Manual Checks in `pdb`:** You can manually check the value of a variable at different breakpoints by printing it each time you hit a breakpoint. This requires you to be proactive in monitoring the variable.\n\n2. **Custom Watch Function:** You can create a small function within your code to log or print the variable's value whenever it's accessed or modified. For example:\n\n    ```python\n    class WatchVariable:\n        def __init__(self, value):\n            self.value = value\n\n        @property\n        def value(self):\n            return self._value\n\n        @value.setter\n        def value(self, new_value):\n            print(f\"Variable changed from {self._value} to {new_value}\")\n            self._value = new_value\n\n    # Usage\n    my_var = WatchVariable(initial_value)\n    ```\n\n   Replace `my_var` with the variable you want to watch.\n\n3. **Using `bdb` or `sys.settrace`:** For more advanced debugging, you can use the `bdb` module or `sys.settrace` to monitor changes. This approach is more complex but allows you to execute a function whenever any line of code is executed, which can include checks to see if certain variables have changed.\n\n4. **External Debugging Tools:** Consider using more advanced debugging tools like `pudb`, `ipdb`, or an IDE like PyCharm or VSCode that may offer more sophisticated variable watching capabilities.\n\nThese methods, while not as straightforward as gdb's watchpoints, provide a way to monitor variables in a Python script."
