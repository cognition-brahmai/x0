Here is the code I have implemented:\n\n```python\nimport threading\n\ndef f(x=None, y=None):\n    print x,y\n\nt = threading.Thread(target=f, args=(x=1,y=2,))\nt.start()\n```"

        "content": "The syntax error you're encountering is due to the misuse of the `args` parameter. The `args` parameter is meant for passing positional arguments, not named arguments, to the target function. To pass named arguments, you should use the `kwargs` parameter, which expects a dictionary of keyword arguments.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to pass named arguments using `kwargs`:\n\n```python\nimport threading\n\ndef f(x=None, y=None):\n    print(x, y)\n\nt = threading.Thread(target=f, kwargs={'x': 1, 'y': 2})\nt.start()\n```\n\nIn this revised code, `kwargs` is used to pass a dictionary of the named arguments `x` and `y` to the function `f`. This should work without any syntax errors, and the expected output will be `1 2`."
