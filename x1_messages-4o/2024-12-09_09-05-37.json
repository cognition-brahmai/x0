        "content": "To create a Python program that modifies each word in a given sentence so that they all start with the same letter, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Choose a target letter that you want all words to start with.\n2. Iterate through each word in the sentence.\n3. Replace the first letter of each word with the target letter.\n4. Reconstruct the sentence with the modified words.\n\nHere's a simple Python program to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef modify_sentence(sentence, target_letter):\n    # Split the sentence into individual words\n    words = sentence.split()\n    \n    # Modify each word to start with the target letter\n    modified_words = []\n    for word in words:\n        # Replace the first letter with the target letter\n        if len(word) > 1:\n            modified_word = target_letter + word[1:]\n        else:\n            modified_word = target_letter\n        modified_words.append(modified_word)\n    \n    # Join the modified words back into a sentence\n    modified_sentence = ' '.join(modified_words)\n    return modified_sentence\n\n# Example usage\ninput_sentence = \"This is a test\"\ntarget_letter = \"S\"\nmodified_sentence = modify_sentence(input_sentence, target_letter)\nprint(modified_sentence)\n```\n\nIn this example, if the input sentence is \"This is a test\" and you choose \"S\" as the target letter, the output will be \"Shis ss s sest\". You can change the `input_sentence` and `target_letter` variables to test with different inputs."
