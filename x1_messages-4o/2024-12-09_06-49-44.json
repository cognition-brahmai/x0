Here's a simple way to do it:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\n# Get the current time in seconds since the Unix epoch\ncurrent_time_seconds = time.time()\n\n# Convert the time to milliseconds\ncurrent_time_milliseconds = int(current_time_seconds * 1000)\n\nprint(current_time_milliseconds)\n```\n\nThis code uses `time.time()`, which returns the current time in seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970). By multiplying it by 1000 and converting it to an integer, you get the time in milliseconds."
