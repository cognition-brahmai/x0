First, we must specify the new 'address' column, and second, we should update the 'department' column to 'Technology.' Can you craft a SQL query using the terms \"structure,\" \"change,\" and \"improvement\" to accomplish this task? The ultimate goal is to optimize our database and ensure that it is always up-to-date. Please incorporate the following formula in your solution: ALTER TABLE employee ADD COLUMN address VARCHAR(255), CHANGE department department VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT 'Technology';"

        "content": "Certainly! To enhance the organization and updating of your 'employee' table, you can use the following SQL query. This query incorporates the terms \"structure,\" \"change,\" and \"improvement,\" aiming to optimize your database and ensure it is always up-to-date:\n\n```sql\n-- Step 1: Structure Improvement by Adding the 'address' Column\nALTER TABLE employee \nADD COLUMN address VARCHAR(255);\n\n-- Step 2: Change and Improvement of the 'department' Column\nALTER TABLE employee \nCHANGE department department VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT 'Technology';\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Structure Improvement**: The first part of the query adds a new column named 'address' to the 'employee' table. This is done using the `ALTER TABLE` statement, which allows you to modify the table structure by adding a new column.\n\n2. **Change and Improvement**: The second part of the query modifies the 'department' column to ensure it has a default value of 'Technology.' This involves using the `CHANGE` keyword to update the column definition, optimizing it for future data consistency.\n\nThis approach ensures your database structure is improved and information remains current, aligning with the goal of maintaining an updated and efficient database."
