For instance, if I have a sentence like \"He isn't not worried about the coronavirus situation\", how can I determine if it has a double negative? The approach to solving this should involve explicitly specifying the multiple steps of reasoning involved. The solution should use Go code and a table of specific negative words to accomplish this task. The code should create a slice of specific negative words and check if the sentence contains any of them, as well as the phrase \"not\" followed by that negative word. If both conditions are satisfied, it should print a message indicating that the sentence contains a double negative."

        "content": "To identify a double negative in a given sentence using Go, you'll need to follow several steps. Here's a detailed approach that includes creating a slice of specific negative words and checking if the sentence contains these words along with \"not\" or any other negative phrase.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Go:\n\n1. **Create a list of negative words**: Prepare a slice containing common negative words.\n\n2. **Split the sentence into words**: Use a function to split the sentence into individual words.\n\n3. **Check for the presence of negative words**: Iterate through the sentence to find occurrences of the negative words.\n\n4. **Identify double negatives**: Check if the sentence contains the word \"not\" followed by another negative word from your list.\n\n5. **Output the result**: Print a message indicating if a double negative is found.\n\nBelow is a sample Go code illustrating these steps:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"strings\"\n)\n\n// Function to check for double negatives in a sentence\nfunc containsDoubleNegative(sentence string) bool {\n\t// List of specific negative words\n\tnegativeWords := []string{\"no\", \"not\", \"never\", \"none\", \"nobody\", \"nothing\", \"nowhere\", \"neither\", \"nor\", \"hardly\", \"barely\", \"scarcely\"}\n\n\t// Split the sentence into words\n\twords := strings.Fields(sentence)\n\n\t// Iterate through the words to find double negatives\n\tfor i, word := range words {\n\t\t// Check if the word is \"not\" or another negative word\n\t\tif word == \"not\" {\n\t\t\t// Check the next word, if exists\n\t\t\tif i+1 < len(words) {\n\t\t\t\tnextWord := words[i+1]\n\t\t\t\t// Check if the next word is in the list of negative words\n\t\t\t\tfor _, negWord := range negativeWords {\n\t\t\t\t\tif nextWord == negWord {\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn true\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\treturn false\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tsentence := \"He isn't not worried about the coronavirus situation\"\n\n\tif containsDoubleNegative(sentence) {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"The sentence contains a double negative.\")\n\t} else {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"The sentence does not contain a double negative.\")\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`negativeWords` Slice**: A collection of common negative words.\n- **`strings.Fields(sentence)`**: Splits the sentence into words.\n- **Iteration**: The code iterates over each word in the sentence.\n  - If the word is \"not\", it checks the next word.\n  - If the next word is a negative word from the `negativeWords` slice, a double negative is found.\n- **Output**: If a double negative is detected, it prints an appropriate message.\n\nThis approach systematically checks for double negatives by identifying sequences like \"not\" followed by another negative word in your list, ensuring accurate detection in various sentences."
