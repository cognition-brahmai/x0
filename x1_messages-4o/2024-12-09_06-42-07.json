The exception says \"No module named 'PyQt5.QtWebKitWidgets'\". I tried importing QtCore, QtGui, and QtWidgets from PyQt5 and they all import without any error. However, when I try to import QtWebKitWidgets, it fails. How can I resolve this issue?\n\nHere is the error and the code that's causing it:\n\n```python\nfrom PyQt5.QtWebKitWidgets import *\nImportError: No module named 'PyQt5.QtWebKitWidgets'\n```\n\nHere are the imports:\n\n```python\nfrom PyQt5.QtCore import *\nfrom PyQt5.QtGui import *\nfrom PyQt5.QtWidgets import *\nfrom PyQt5.QtWebKitWidgets import *\n```\n\nMy Python path and environment path are as follows:\n\nPython path:\n```python\nC:\\PYTHON35;C:\\PYTHON35\\DLLs;C:\\PYTHON35\\LIB;C:\\PYTHON35\\LIB\\LIB-TK;\n```\n\nEnvironment path:\n```python\nC:\\Python35\\Lib\\site-packages\\PyQt5;C:\\Python35;C:\\Python35\\Lib;C:\\Python35\\Lib\\site-packages;C:\\Python35\\Scripts ....\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the removal of the `QtWebKitWidgets` module in PyQt5 version 5.6.0. Starting from this version, the `QtWebKit` module was deprecated and later removed in favor of `QtWebEngine`. This change was made because `QtWebEngine` is based on Chromium and is more modern compared to `QtWebKit`.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can switch from using `QtWebKitWidgets` to `QtWebEngineWidgets`. Here's how you can modify your imports to use `QtWebEngine`:\n\n1. First, ensure you have `PyQtWebEngine` installed. You can install it using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install PyQtWebEngine\n   ```\n\n2. Update your imports in the code to use `QtWebEngineWidgets` instead of `QtWebKitWidgets`:\n\n   ```python\n   from PyQt5.QtCore import *\n   from PyQt5.QtGui import *\n   from PyQt5.QtWidgets import *\n   from PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets import *\n   ```\n\n3. If you were using any specific classes or methods from `QtWebKitWidgets`, you will need to find their equivalents in `QtWebEngineWidgets`. The API is similar, but there might be differences, so you may need to adjust your code accordingly.\n\nBy making these changes, you should be able to resolve the import error and adapt your code to use the newer and more robust `QtWebEngine` module."
