I am struggling to understand how looping over a dictionary or set is done in what is referred to as 'arbitrary' order. As Python is a programming language, shouldn't everything be 100% determined? There must be some algorithm that Python uses to decide which part of the dictionary or set is chosen first, second and so on. Can someone explain what I might be missing?"

        "content": "The term \"arbitrary order\" when discussing dictionaries and sets in Python can indeed be a bit confusing, especially since, as you mentioned, everything in programming is ultimately determined by some algorithm. Let's delve into this to clarify.\n\n### Dictionaries and Sets in Python\n\n1. **Dictionaries**:\n   - In Python 3.6 and later, the insertion order for dictionaries is preserved. This means that if you iterate over a dictionary, the elements will be returned in the order they were added. However, this was an implementation detail in Python 3.6 and became a language feature starting from Python 3.7.\n\n2. **Sets**:\n   - Sets are collections of unique elements. In Python, sets do not guarantee any specific order of elements when iterating over them. The iteration order is influenced by the internal hashing mechanism which is used to ensure the uniqueness and allow for fast membership tests. As a result, the order is not based on the insertion order or any logical ordering of the elements.\n\n### Why \"Arbitrary\" Order?\n\nThe term \"arbitrary\" refers to the fact that the order is determined by the internal implementation and not by any logical ordering like numeric or lexicographical order. In the case of sets, the order can change between different runs of the program or different versions of Python due to changes in the hashing algorithm or memory allocation.\n\n### Internal Mechanism\n\n- **Hashing**: Both dictionaries and sets use hash tables internally. Hashing is a process where a hash function converts input (keys for dictionaries, elements for sets) into a fixed-size string of bytes, which usually appears as a seemingly random sequence of numbers and letters.\n- **Collision Resolution**: When two inputs hash to the same value (a collision), Python uses a method to resolve these and store the data efficiently.\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Dictionaries**: From Python 3.7 onwards, dictionaries maintain insertion order. Before that, the order was arbitrary because it was based on the hash table implementation.\n- **Sets**: Order is arbitrary because it is based on the hash function and table that do not consider the order of insertion or any inherent ordering of the values.\n\nWhile the order may seem arbitrary, it is indeed determined by the internal mechanisms of Python's data structures, specifically in how they handle hashing and memory management."
