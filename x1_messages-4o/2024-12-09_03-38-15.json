However, when I attempted to remove `admin.autodiscover()` from root urls and added `admin.site.register(User, UserAdmin)` in my app models, I received an `AlreadyRegistered` exception. This is presumably because the models users are already registered in `django.contrib.auth`. How can I properly remove Groups and Sites?"

        "content": "To remove the `Groups` and `Sites` from the Django admin while avoiding the `AlreadyRegistered` exception, you can unregister these models instead of trying to prevent them from being registered in the first place. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Unregister the Models:**\n   You can use the `unregister` method provided by `admin.site` to remove the `Groups` and `Sites` models from the admin. You can do this in one of your app's `admin.py` files. Here's an example:\n\n   ```python\n   from django.contrib import admin\n   from django.contrib.auth.models import Group\n   from django.contrib.sites.models import Site\n\n   # Unregister the Group and Site models\n   admin.site.unregister(Group)\n   admin.site.unregister(Site)\n   ```\n\n2. **Register the User Model (if needed):**\n   If you want to customize the `User` model in the admin, you can register it explicitly with your custom `UserAdmin` class. Here's an example:\n\n   ```python\n   from django.contrib import admin\n   from django.contrib.auth.models import User\n   from django.contrib.auth.admin import UserAdmin\n\n   # Unregister the default User admin\n   admin.site.unregister(User)\n\n   # Register the User model with your custom UserAdmin\n   admin.site.register(User, UserAdmin)\n   ```\n\n3. **Ensure `admin.autodiscover()` is Present:**\n   You generally should keep `admin.autodiscover()` in your `urls.py` to ensure all admin configurations are loaded. However, unregistering the models as shown above will safely remove them from the admin interface without causing registration conflicts.\n\nAfter making these changes, `Groups` and `Sites` should no longer appear in your Django admin interface, but the `User` model will remain accessible, potentially with any customizations you apply via `UserAdmin`."
