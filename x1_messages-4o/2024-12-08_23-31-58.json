        "content": "Certainly! In Scala, pattern matching is a powerful feature that allows you to match on the structure of data, such as case classes. Here's an example of how you might use pattern matching with the `Person` and `Animal` case classes:\n\n```scala\n// Define the case classes\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int)\ncase class Animal(species: String, color: String)\n\n// Define a function that uses pattern matching to handle different instances\ndef describeEntity(entity: Any): String = entity match {\n  case Person(name, age) => s\"This is a person named $name who is $age years old.\"\n  case Animal(species, color) => s\"This is a $color $species.\"\n  case _ => \"Unknown entity.\"\n}\n\n// Example usage\nval person = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\nval animal = Animal(\"Cat\", \"Black\")\n\nprintln(describeEntity(person))  // Output: This is a person named Alice who is 30 years old.\nprintln(describeEntity(animal))  // Output: This is a Black Cat.\nprintln(describeEntity(\"Something else\"))  // Output: Unknown entity.\n```\n\nIn this example, the `describeEntity` function takes an argument of type `Any` and uses pattern matching to determine whether it's a `Person`, an `Animal`, or something else. For each case class, it extracts the relevant fields and constructs a descriptive string. If the input doesn't match any of the defined cases, it falls back to the default case (`_`), which handles unknown entities."
