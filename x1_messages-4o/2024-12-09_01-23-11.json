The error message also doesn't specify which layer is causing the problem. I have already enabled PYTORCH_JIT=0. What is the recommended way to get more information from PyTorch JIT about this error? I am using PyTorch 1.3.0 with only CPU support."

        "content": "The error you are encountering is due to the fact that PyTorch's JIT tracing expects the model to return either a single tensor or a tuple of tensors. If your model's `forward` method returns something else (for example, a list or a dictionary), you'll encounter the error you're seeing. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check the Output of Your Model:**\n   Make sure that the `forward` method of your model `FPNImproved` returns either a single tensor or a tuple of tensors. If it returns a list, dictionary, or any other data structure, you'll need to modify it to return a tuple instead.\n\n2. **Debugging the Output:**\n   Insert some print statements in the `forward` method of your model to check the type of the output just before returning it. This will help you identify if the output is not in the expected format.\n\n3. **Modify the Forward Method:**\n   If the output is not a tensor or tuple of tensors, modify the `forward` method to convert the output into a tuple. For example:\n   ```python\n   def forward(self, x):\n       # Your model computations\n       output = ...  # This is the current output\n       if isinstance(output, list):\n           output = tuple(output)\n       elif isinstance(output, dict):\n           output = tuple(output.values())\n       return output\n   ```\n\n4. **Tracing with More Information:**\n   Unfortunately, PyTorch 1.3.0 doesn't provide very detailed error messages for JIT tracing errors. Consider upgrading to a more recent version of PyTorch if possible, as newer versions often have improved error messages and tracing capabilities.\n\n5. **Use `torch.jit.script` Instead of `torch.jit.trace`:**\n   If your model has control flow logic or variable-length outputs, `torch.jit.script` might be more appropriate than `torch.jit.trace`. Scripting captures the model's control flow, whereas tracing does not.\n   ```python\n   scripted_model = torch.jit.script(mod)\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify the root cause of the error and adapt your model to be compatible with PyTorch's JIT tracing."
