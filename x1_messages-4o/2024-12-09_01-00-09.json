        "content": "I am working on a GPU algorithm that involves a lot of modular computations, particularly various operations on matrices in a finite field which ultimately reduce to primitive operations like: (a*b - c*d) mod m or (a*b + c) mod m, where a,b,c and d are residues modulo m and m is a 32-bit prime. The performance of the algorithm is mostly limited by slow modular arithmetic because integer modulo (%) and division operations are not supported on the GPU in hardware. How can I execute efficient modular computations with CUDA? I have tried using the following code snippet but it doesn't seem to work:\n\n```c++\n__global__ void mod_kernel(unsigned *gout, const unsigned *gin) {\n\nunsigned tid = threadIdx.x;\nunsigned a = gin[tid], b = gin[tid * 2], m = gin[tid * 3];\n\ntypedef unsigned long long u64;\n\n__syncthreads();\nunsigned r = (unsigned)(((u64)a * (u64)b) % m);\n__syncthreads();\ngout[tid] = r;\n}\n```\n\nWhen I disassemble this with `cuobjdump --dump-sass`, I see that there is a call to a 0xf8 procedure which implements a complex algorithm. How can I make this more efficient and quicker?"

        "content": "To perform efficient modular arithmetic on the GPU, especially with CUDA, you want to minimize the use of division and modulo operations since they can be quite slow. For modular operations involving a prime modulus, you can utilize certain optimizations and techniques to speed up computations.\n\nHere are a few strategies that might help you optimize your CUDA code for modular arithmetic:\n\n1. **Precompute Multiplicative Inverse:**\n   If the modulus `m` is a constant and a prime, you can precompute the multiplicative inverse of any integer `b` modulo `m` using Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that for a prime `m`, `b^(m-2) \u2261 b^(-1) (mod m)`. This can replace division with multiplication by an inverse.\n\n2. **Use Barrett Reduction:**\n   Barrett reduction is an algorithm that allows you to replace expensive division operations with multiplications. It involves some precomputation and can be very efficient if you need to perform many modular reductions with the same modulus `m`.\n\n3. **Montgomery Reduction:**\n   Montgomery reduction is another technique that is efficient for modular arithmetic, especially when you have a fixed modulus and need to perform many modular multiplications. It works by transforming numbers into a special representation (Montgomery form), performing operations, and then transforming back.\n\n4. **Avoiding `%` with Multiplication and Shifts:**\n   You can sometimes use properties of your specific modulus to avoid divisions. For example, if `m` is close to a power of two, you might be able to use bitwise operations for modulo reductions.\n\n5. **Use Shared Memory:**\n   If `m` is constant across threads, consider loading it into shared memory to reduce global memory accesses.\n\n6. **CUDA Intrinsics and Warp Synchronization:**\n   Make use of CUDA intrinsics and consider warp-level primitives which can sometimes offer a speed advantage over block-level synchronization.\n\nHere's an example of how you might apply some of these ideas:\n\n```c++\n__device__ __forceinline__ unsigned mod_mul(unsigned a, unsigned b, unsigned m) {\n    // Use unsigned long long to prevent overflow\n    unsigned long long product = (unsigned long long)a * (unsigned long long)b;\n    // Barrett reduction-like technique\n    unsigned q = (unsigned)(product >> 32);\n    unsigned r = (unsigned)(product) - q * m;\n    return r >= m ? r - m : r;\n}\n\n__global__ void mod_kernel(unsigned *gout, const unsigned *gin, unsigned m) {\n    unsigned tid = threadIdx.x;\n    unsigned a = gin[tid], b = gin[tid * 2];\n\n    unsigned r = mod_mul(a, b, m);\n\n    gout[tid] = r;\n}\n```\n\nRemember to profile your code using tools like `nvprof` or `Nsight Compute` to ensure that your optimizations are having the desired effect. Each GPU architecture might have different performance characteristics, so it\u2019s always good to test how these strategies perform on your specific hardware."
