How many machines would I need to distribute my computations using Hadoop / MapReduce / Mahout significantly faster than running on a single machine without these distributed frameworks? This is considering the computational overhead versus gains. I assume that distributing between just 2 machines the overall time might be worse than not distributing and simply running on a single machine due to the overhead involved to distribute the computations. A technical note to consider is that some of the heavy computations are very parallelizable, as long as each machine has its own copy of the raw data."

        "content": "When considering distributed computing frameworks like Hadoop/MapReduce and Mahout for machine learning computations, the decision to distribute tasks across multiple machines hinges on several factors, including the nature of the tasks, the size of the data, the network bandwidth, and the computational power of the individual machines. Here are some considerations to help you decide how many machines you might need:\n\n1. **Parallelizability of Tasks**: Since you mentioned that your computations are highly parallelizable, this is a good indicator that distributing them could be beneficial. Tasks that can be easily divided into independent subtasks are ideal for distributed processing.\n\n2. **Data Size**: If the dataset is large and cannot fit into the memory of a single machine, distributing it across multiple machines can help. In Hadoop/MapReduce, data is split into blocks and processed in parallel, which can significantly speed up processing if the data size is a limiting factor on a single machine.\n\n3. **Computational Overhead**: Distributed frameworks introduce overhead in terms of data shuffling, synchronization, and managing the distributed environment. For small clusters, this overhead can outweigh the benefits. Typically, significant gains in performance start to be seen with 5-10 nodes, depending on the task complexity and data size.\n\n4. **Network Bandwidth**: High network latency and low bandwidth can become bottlenecks in distributed systems. Ensure your LAN has sufficient bandwidth to handle the data transfer between machines efficiently.\n\n5. **Hardware Configuration**: The performance gain also depends on the hardware capabilities of your machines. If the machines are heterogeneous or significantly slower than your main machine, the gains might be minimal.\n\n6. **Benchmarking**: Start with a small number of machines (e.g., 3-5) and run benchmark tests to measure the performance improvement. Scale up incrementally and observe the changes in execution time. This empirical approach will provide insights specific to your environment and workload.\n\nIn summary, while there is no one-size-fits-all number of machines, starting with a small cluster and scaling based on performance measurements is a practical approach. Additionally, consider using Spark, which is generally faster than Hadoop for iterative machine learning tasks, due to its in-memory processing capabilities."
