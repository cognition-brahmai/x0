        "content": "In the PyTorch tutorial, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained on a CIFAR dataset. The network design is as follows:\n\n```python\n    class Net(nn.Module):\n        def __init__(self):\n            super(Net, self).__init__()\n            self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 6, 5)\n            self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)\n            self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(6, 16, 5)\n            self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 5 * 5, 120)\n            self.fc2 = nn.Linear(120, 84)\n            self.fc3 = nn.Linear(84, 10)\n\n        def forward(self, x):\n            x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))\n            x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))\n            x = x.view(-1, 16 * 5 * 5)\n            x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))\n            x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))\n            x = self.fc3(x)\n            return x \n```\n\nIn this network, the last layer fc3 predicts the probability of belonging to 10 classes without a softmax. Shouldn't a softmax be applied first to ensure the output of the fc layer is between 0 and 1 and sum before calculating cross-entropy loss? When I applied softmax and reran the model, the accuracy dropped to around 35%. Why is this happening?"

        "content": "In PyTorch, when you use a loss function like `nn.CrossEntropyLoss`, it expects raw, unnormalized scores (also known as logits) from the model as its input. This is because `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` implicitly applies a `softmax` function to these logits during the loss computation. Therefore, you don't need to apply a `softmax` function to the output of your final layer before passing it to the loss function.\n\nIf you explicitly apply a `softmax` function to your model's output before calculating the cross-entropy loss, you're effectively applying the softmax twice: once manually and once implicitly in the loss function. This can lead to numerical instability and incorrect gradient updates, which might explain the drop in accuracy you observed.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Model Output**: The `fc3` layer outputs logits, which are real-valued scores for each class.\n2. **Cross-Entropy Loss**: `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` takes these logits and computes the softmax internally, which converts the logits into probabilities that sum to 1. Then, it calculates the negative log likelihood loss.\n\nTherefore, to achieve correct training, you should:\n\n- Remove any manual application of softmax before passing the logits to the `nn.CrossEntropyLoss`.\n- If you want to compute probabilities from the logits for purposes other than loss computation (e.g., for evaluation or understanding model confidence), you can apply the `softmax` function separately on the logits outside of the training loop.\n\nBy following this approach, your model should maintain or improve its accuracy because the loss calculation will be performed correctly."
