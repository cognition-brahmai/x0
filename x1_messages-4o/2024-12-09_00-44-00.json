        "content": "Certainly! In Python, both `exit()` and `sys.exit()` are used to terminate a program, but there are some differences between them:\n\n### `exit()`\n- **Location**: `exit()` is a convenience function provided by the `site` module, which is automatically imported during the interactive session of Python. It is primarily intended for use in interactive environments, such as the Python shell or Jupyter notebooks.\n- **Purpose**: It's designed to make it easier for users working interactively to exit the interpreter.\n- **Limitations**: Since it's meant for interactive sessions, using `exit()` in a script or a program isn't recommended. It might not always be available or behave the same way when the script is executed in non-interactive environments.\n\n### `sys.exit()`\n- **Location**: `sys.exit()` is part of the `sys` module, which needs to be imported explicitly in your script using `import sys`.\n- **Purpose**: It is suitable for terminating a running script. It raises the `SystemExit` exception, which can be caught and handled if needed.\n- **Usage**: `sys.exit()` can take an optional argument (integer or string) to specify the exit status or message. An integer value of `0` generally indicates successful termination, while any other integer value indicates an error.\n\n### When to Use Each:\n- Use `exit()` when working interactively in a Python shell or Jupyter notebook for convenience.\n- Use `sys.exit()` when writing Python scripts or programs that need a controlled and well-defined way to terminate execution, especially if you need to specify an exit status or handle the exit condition.\n\nIn summary, `sys.exit()` is more robust and suitable for use in scripts, while `exit()` is convenient for interactive sessions."
