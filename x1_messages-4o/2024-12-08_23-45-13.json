Calculate the average temperature for each year.\n3. Compute the overall average of these annual averages.\n\nHere's a MATLAB code snippet to perform these operations:\n\n```matlab\n% Data input: Monthly average temperatures for each year (10 years of data)\ntemperatureData = [\n    -12, -13, -12, -10, -5, 0, 3, 3, 0, -4, -9, -11;\n    -14, -14, -13, -10, -5, 0, 3, 2, 0, -5, -10, -12;\n    -12, -13, -12, -9, -5, 0, 3, 3, 0, -4, -9, -11;\n    -14, -14, -13, -10, -5, 0, 3, 2, 0, -5, -10, -12;\n    -12, -13, -12, -9, -4, 0, 3, 3, 0, -4, -9, -11;\n    -14, -14, -13, -10, -5, 0, 3, 2, 0, -5, -10, -12;\n    -12, -13, -12, -9, -4, 0, 3, 3, 0, -4, -9, -11;\n    -14, -14, -13, -10, -5, 0, 3, 2, 0, -5, -10, -12;\n    -12, -13, -12, -9, -4, 0, 3, 3, 0, -4, -9, -11;\n    -14, -14, -13, -10, -5, 0, 3, 2, 0, -5, -10, -12\n];\n\n% Calculate the annual average temperature for each year\nannualAverages = mean(temperatureData, 2);\n\n% Calculate the overall average temperature over the entire period\noverallAverage = mean(annualAverages);\n\n% Display the result\ndisp(['The overall annual average temperature in Svalbard, Norway is ', num2str(overallAverage), ' \u00b0C']);\n```\n\nThe above code snippet will calculate the overall annual average temperature for Svalbard, Norway, based on the given data. The `mean` function is used to compute the average temperature for each year and then the average of these annual averages is calculated to get the overall average temperature."
