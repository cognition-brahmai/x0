My aim is to have a standard message format, but I also want the ability to temporarily add information about a file being read, like its name. The message format should revert to its default once the file is no longer being read. How can I make the program automatically include the relevant file name in its message (I would prefer the error message to be \"ERROR while reading file ***: \u2026\" instead of \"ERROR: \u2026\")?"

        "content": "To temporarily change the logging message format in Python using the `logging` module, you can create a custom logging filter or a context manager to adjust the logging format when needed. Here's a simple way to achieve this using a context manager:\n\n1. Define a context manager that adjusts the logging format to include the file name when you are reading a file.\n2. Revert the logging format back to the default once you are done.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n\n```python\nimport logging\nfrom contextlib import contextmanager\n\n# Configure the default logging format\ndefault_format = '%(levelname)s: %(message)s'\nfile_reading_format = 'ERROR while reading file %(filename)s: %(message)s'\n\n# Create a handler and set the default format\nhandler = logging.StreamHandler()\nformatter = logging.Formatter(default_format)\nhandler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\n# Get the logger and attach the handler\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.addHandler(handler)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\n# Define a context manager to temporarily change the logging format\n@contextmanager\ndef reading_file_context(file_name):\n    # Change the logging format to include file information\n    formatter = logging.Formatter(file_reading_format)\n    handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n    try:\n        yield\n    finally:\n        # Revert to the default logging format\n        formatter = logging.Formatter(default_format)\n        handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n\ndef read_file(file_name):\n    # Simulate reading a file and logging an error\n    with reading_file_context(file_name):\n        logger.error(\"An error occurred.\")\n\n# Example usage\nlogger.info(\"Starting the process...\")\nread_file(\"example.txt\")\nlogger.info(\"Process completed.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Default Logging Setup**: The logging is initially set up with a default format that doesn't include the file name.\n- **Context Manager**: The `reading_file_context` context manager temporarily changes the logging format to include the file name while reading a file.\n- **Format Restoration**: After the block inside the context manager is executed, the logging format is reverted to its default.\n\nThis approach allows you to encapsulate the logic for changing and restoring the logging format, making it both reusable and clean. You can customize the `file_reading_format` to suit your specific needs further."
