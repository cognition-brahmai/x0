My configuration is as follows: OS: Mac OS X 10.6.6, Python 2.7, virtualenv 1.5.1 and pip 0.8.1. When I try to install from the PyPi mirror, it also installs version 0.91.1, as shown in the command: `$ pip install -i http://d.pypi.python.org/simple matplotlib`. Despite the release of matplotlib 1.0.1, this issue still persists."

        "content": "When you encounter an issue where `pip` installs an older version of a package despite newer versions being available on PyPI, there can be several reasons for this behavior. Here's a step-by-step process to help you troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Package Compatibility**: Ensure that the version of `matplotlib` you intend to install is compatible with your Python version and your operating system. Sometimes, newer versions might have compatibility issues or dependencies that aren't met.\n\n2. **Upgrade pip and setuptools**: Older versions of `pip` and `setuptools` might not handle package installations correctly. Upgrade them to the latest versions:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade pip setuptools\n   ```\n\n3. **Clear pip cache**: Clearing the cache can help if there are corrupted files or old versions causing the issue:\n   ```bash\n   pip cache purge\n   ```\n\n4. **Specify the Version**: Explicitly specify the version of `matplotlib` you want to install:\n   ```bash\n   pip install matplotlib==1.0.0\n   ```\n\n5. **Use a Different PyPI Mirror**: If you're using a PyPI mirror and it hasn't updated, try using the main PyPI server or a different mirror:\n   ```bash\n   pip install matplotlib --index-url=https://pypi.org/simple\n   ```\n\n6. **Check Virtual Environment**: Make sure that your virtual environment is activated correctly. Sometimes, packages might be installed in a global environment instead of the virtual environment.\n\n7. **Dependency Conflicts**: Check if there are any dependency conflicts that could be causing `pip` to resolve to an older version. Use:\n   ```bash\n   pip check\n   ```\n\n8. **Verbose Output**: Install with verbose output to get more details about what's happening:\n   ```bash\n   pip install matplotlib --verbose\n   ```\n\nIf these steps don't resolve the issue, it might be helpful to check the `pip` version log or any error messages that could provide further insight into why the older version is being installed. Additionally, consider checking the `requirements` and `constraints` files in your project for any version specifications that might be affecting the installation."
