        "content": "A web crawler, also known as a spider or bot, is an automated program or script that systematically browses the World Wide Web to index and gather information about web pages. It is primarily used by search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo to update their web content or index in order to provide relevant search results to users.\n\nHere\u2019s how a web crawler typically works:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Crawlers begin with a list of URLs to visit, known as seeds. These URLs can be specified by the operator or automatically generated.\n\n2. **Fetching**: The crawler visits each URL in the list and retrieves the content of the webpage. This includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other linked resources.\n\n3. **Parsing**: After fetching a page, the crawler extracts links to other pages from the HTML source. These links are added to the list of URLs to be visited.\n\n4. **Indexing**: The content of the page is analyzed and indexed, which involves storing certain information about the page in a database. This helps search engines quickly retrieve relevant information in response to a query.\n\n5. **Following Rules**: Crawlers comply with the \"robots.txt\" file present on websites, which specifies which pages should not be crawled. They also adhere to rate limits to avoid overloading websites.\n\n6. **Iteration**: The process of fetching, parsing, and indexing repeats, allowing the crawler to discover new pages and keep the database up to date.\n\nWeb crawlers are crucial for keeping search engine indexes current and comprehensive, enabling users to find accurate and timely information on the web."
