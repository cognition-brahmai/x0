        "content": "In Python, I am trying to override a method from a superclass, but with a different signature. For example, I have a superclass named 'Super' with a method 'method1'. I also have a subclass named 'Sub' which inherits from 'Super' and it also has a method 'method1' but with different parameters. Is this a correct approach? Will the calls to 'method1' always go to the subclass? I am planning to have two subclasses, each overriding 'method1' with different parameters.\n\nHere's the code for reference:\n\n```python\nclass Super():\n  def method1():\n    pass\n\nclass Sub(Super):\n  def method1(param1, param2, param3):\n    # perform some operations\n    pass\n```"

        "content": "When you override a method in a subclass in Python, you are replacing the implementation of that method from the superclass with the one in the subclass. However, Python does not support method overloading based on parameter types or count, like some other languages (e.g., Java). This means that if you override a method in a subclass, you should maintain the method signature (the number and types of parameters) to avoid confusion and potential errors.\n\nIn your case, you're changing the signature of `method1` in the subclass `Sub`, which can lead to issues if you call `method1` on an instance of `Sub` using an instance of `Super`. If you call `method1` on an instance of `Sub`, you'll need to use the new signature (`param1, param2, param3`), and it won't match the signature in `Super`.\n\nHere's how you could structure your code to ensure correct method overriding:\n\n```python\nclass Super:\n    def method1(self):\n        # Original implementation\n        pass\n\nclass Sub(Super):\n    def method1(self, param1, param2, param3):\n        # Overridden implementation with additional parameters\n        # You might want to call the superclass method if needed\n        # super().method1()\n        pass\n\n# Usage example\nsuper_instance = Super()\nsuper_instance.method1()  # Calls Super's method1\n\nsub_instance = Sub()\nsub_instance.method1(1, 2, 3)  # Calls Sub's method1\n```\n\nKey points:\n1. Ensure that the `method1` in `Sub` takes the same number of parameters as you intend to pass when calling it.\n2. You can use `super().method1()` to call the superclass implementation if needed.\n3. Ensure that each subclass has a unique signature if you plan to override with different parameters.\n\nIf you have two subclasses with different parameters for `method1`, make sure to manage your calls accordingly based on the subclass you're working with. Python does not automatically resolve method calls based on parameters; it relies on the method being called directly."
