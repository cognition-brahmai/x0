I could think of two approaches, but none seems satisfactory. First, by checking the thread name as the main thread is instantiated in threading.py like this: `Thread.__init__(self, name=\"MainThread\")`. So basically, I'm thinking of doing something like: `if threading.current_thread().name == 'MainThread'`. But, is this name fixed? I have seen codes that checked whether 'MainThread' is contained anywhere in the thread's name. The second approach is to store a reference to the starting thread the moment the program starts up, while there are no other threads yet. Although this would be absolutely reliable, it seems too cumbersome for such a simple query. Is there a more concise way of doing this?"

        "content": "In Python, you can reliably determine whether the current thread is the main thread using the `threading` module, which provides a more direct and clear approach than checking the thread name or storing a reference to the starting thread. You can use the `threading.main_thread()` function, which returns the main `Thread` object, and compare it with the current thread using `threading.current_thread()`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport threading\n\ndef is_main_thread():\n    return threading.current_thread() == threading.main_thread()\n\n# Example usage\nif is_main_thread():\n    print(\"This is the main thread.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"This is not the main thread.\")\n```\n\nThis approach is concise and reliable because it uses the built-in `threading` module's functionality to directly ascertain whether the current thread is the main thread. It avoids reliance on thread names or manually tracking threads, thus making your code cleaner and less error-prone."
