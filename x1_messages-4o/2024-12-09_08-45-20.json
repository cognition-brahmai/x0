        "content": "For a flexible EXIF manipulation library in Python, you might want to consider using `piexif`. It's a powerful library that allows you to read, modify, and write EXIF data to JPEG and TIFF files. It is particularly useful if you need to manipulate proprietary tags, as it offers a lot of flexibility in handling EXIF data.\n\nHere's a quick overview of what you can do with `piexif`:\n\n- **Read EXIF Data**: You can easily extract EXIF data from images and work with it in a dictionary format.\n- **Modify EXIF Data**: You can change existing tags or add new ones, including proprietary or custom tags.\n- **Write EXIF Data**: Once you're done modifying the EXIF data, you can write it back to the image.\n- **Remove EXIF Data**: If needed, you can also strip EXIF data from an image entirely.\n\nTo get started, you can install `piexif` via pip:\n\n```bash\npip install piexif\n```\n\nHere's a basic example of how you might use `piexif`:\n\n```python\nimport piexif\nfrom PIL import Image\n\n# Load an image\nimg = Image.open(\"your_image.jpg\")\n\n# Extract EXIF data\nexif_dict = piexif.load(img.info['exif'])\n\n# Modify a tag (example: setting a new Artist)\nexif_dict['0th'][piexif.ImageIFD.Artist] = \"New Artist\"\n\n# Create a new EXIF byte object\nexif_bytes = piexif.dump(exif_dict)\n\n# Save the image with the new EXIF data\nimg.save(\"your_image_modified.jpg\", \"jpeg\", exif=exif_bytes)\n```\n\nNote that `piexif` works well with `PIL` or `Pillow` for image handling, so you may want to ensure you have that installed as well.\n\nIf you need even more control and features, you might also look into `ExifTool`, which is a Perl library with a Python wrapper called `pyexiftool`. It provides extensive functionality for reading, writing, and editing metadata in a wide range of file formats. However, it may require additional setup since it depends on the underlying `ExifTool` command-line application."
