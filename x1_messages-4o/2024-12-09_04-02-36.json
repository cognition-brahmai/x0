For instance, if I have x = [1, 2, 3] and y = [1, 2, 3], x and y are equal but they are not the same object. I am in search of a function like sameObject(x, y) which would return False in this case. Can you guide me on how to check if two variables point to the same object in Python?"

The `is` operator checks for object identity, meaning it checks whether two variables point to the exact same object in memory.\n\nHere's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nx = [1, 2, 3]\ny = [1, 2, 3]\nz = x\n\n# Check if x and y reference the same object\nprint(x is y)  # Output: False\n\n# Check if x and z reference the same object\nprint(x is z)  # Output: True\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- `x is y` returns `False` because `x` and `y` are two separate lists, even though they have the same contents.\n- `x is z` returns `True` because `z` is assigned to `x`, making them reference the same list object in memory."
