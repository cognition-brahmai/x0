Here's a simple way to achieve this using the built-in file handling methods:\n\n```python\n# Open the file in read mode\nwith open('yourfile.txt', 'r') as file:\n    # Read the entire file content\n    content = file.read()\n\n# Remove newline characters\nsingle_line_string = content.replace('\\n', '')\n\n# Print or use the single-line string\nprint(single_line_string)\n```\n\nThis script opens the file `yourfile.txt`, reads its entire content into a string, and then replaces all newline characters with an empty string, effectively joining all lines into a single line. You can replace `'yourfile.txt'` with the path to your actual file."
