        "content": "A sweatshop is a term used to describe a workplace, often in the garment or manufacturing industry, where workers are employed under poor conditions. These conditions typically include long hours, low pay, and inadequate safety measures. Sweatshops are frequently criticized for exploiting workers, often in developing countries, where labor laws may be less strict or poorly enforced. The term is also associated with child labor and the lack of workers' rights. Efforts to combat sweatshops include advocating for fair trade practices, improving labor laws, and encouraging companies to adopt ethical sourcing policies."
