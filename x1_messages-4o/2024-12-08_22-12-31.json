Multiply 10 by 6 to get 60.  \n2. Add 12 and 8 to get 20.  \n3. Subtract 20 from 60 to get 40.\n\nIt seems my calculation does not yield 50. Let's try a different approach:\n\nEquation:  \n\\[ (10 \\times 8) - (12 + 6) \\]\n\nStep-by-step breakdown:  \n1. Multiply 10 by 8 to get 80.  \n2. Add 12 and 6 to get 18.  \n3. Subtract 18 from 80 to get 62.\n\nIt seems I made another error. Let's adjust:\n\nEquation:  \n\\[ 10 \\times 6 - 8 \\]\n\nStep-by-step breakdown:  \n1. Multiply 10 by 6 to get 60.  \n2. Subtract 8 to get 52.\n\nI apologize for the confusion. Let's try again:\n\nEquation:  \n\\[ 10 \\times 4 + 6 - 8 \\]\n\nStep-by-step breakdown:  \n1. Multiply 10 by 4 to get 40.  \n2. Add 6 to get 46.  \n3. Subtract 8 to get 38.\n\nI realize my attempts aren't leading to 50. Let me attempt once more:\n\nEquation:  \n\\[ (8 \\times 6) + 8 - 6 \\]\n\nStep-by-step breakdown:  \n1. Multiply 8 by 6 to get 48.  \n2. Add 8 to get 56.  \n3. Subtract 6 to get 50.\n\nThis equation results in 50. Thank you for your patience!"
