I happened to find a snippet of code online that does what I need, however, I find it rather complex and I'm hesitant to use it. I'm considering looping through the decimal numbers 1\u201332768, converting them to binary and using the binary representation as a filter to select the right numbers. I was wondering, is there a better way to do this? Maybe using the map() function?"

        "content": "Generating all combinations of a list of numbers can indeed be achieved using the approach you mentioned. However, there's a more straightforward way to achieve this using Python's `itertools` module, which provides a convenient `combinations` function. Unfortunately, the `combinations` function generates combinations of a specific length, so for generating all combinations of all possible lengths, you would need to iterate over all possible lengths.\n\nHere's a simple way to use `itertools` to generate all combinations:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]\n\n# Generate all combinations\nall_combinations = []\nfor r in range(1, len(numbers) + 1):\n    combinations_r = itertools.combinations(numbers, r)\n    all_combinations.extend(combinations_r)\n\n# Convert to list for easy access\nall_combinations = list(all_combinations)\n\n# Print the total number of combinations\nprint(f\"Total combinations: {len(all_combinations)}\")\n\n# Optionally, print all combinations\nfor combination in all_combinations:\n    print(combination)\n```\n\nHere's how it works:\n- The `itertools.combinations` function generates combinations of a specified length `r`.\n- By looping over all possible lengths `r` from 1 to the length of the list, you can generate all possible combinations.\n- The combinations are collected into a list `all_combinations`.\n\nThis approach avoids the need for converting numbers to binary and mapping them manually, making the code more readable and avoiding potential pitfalls with binary conversion logic."
