Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the 2D array\narray = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [10, 2, 2]])\n\n# Get the shape of the array\nrows, columns = array.shape\n\nprint(f\"Number of rows: {rows}\")\nprint(f\"Number of columns: {columns}\")\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\nNumber of rows: 2\nNumber of columns: 3\n```\n\nThe `shape` attribute returns a tuple where the first element is the number of rows and the second element is the number of columns."
