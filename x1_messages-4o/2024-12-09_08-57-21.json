        "content": "Certainly! Here's a simple example of a MATLAB program that computes the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a given sequence using the basic formula. This example does not use MATLAB's built-in `fft` function, but rather computes the DFT manually to illustrate the process.\n\n```matlab\n% Example MATLAB program to compute the DFT of a sequence\n\n% Define the input sequence\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4]; % Example sequence\n\n% Get the length of the sequence\nN = length(x);\n\n% Initialize the output DFT array\nX = zeros(1, N);\n\n% Compute the DFT\nfor k = 0:N-1\n    % Initialize the k-th DFT coefficient\n    X_k = 0;\n    \n    % Compute the k-th DFT coefficient using the formula\n    for n = 0:N-1\n        X_k = X_k + x(n+1) * exp(-2j * pi * k * n / N);\n    end\n    \n    % Store the result in the output array\n    X(k+1) = X_k;\nend\n\n% Display the DFT result\ndisp('DFT of the input sequence:')\ndisp(X)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Input Sequence**: The program starts with an example sequence `x = [1, 2, 3, 4]`.\n- **DFT Calculation**: The DFT is calculated using two nested loops:\n  - The outer loop iterates over each output frequency index `k`.\n  - The inner loop computes the summation for each `k` using the DFT formula:  \n    \\( X[k] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n] \\cdot e^{-j \\cdot 2\\pi \\cdot k \\cdot n / N} \\)\n- **Output**: The computed DFT coefficients are stored in the array `X` and displayed.\n\nYou can modify the input sequence `x` to compute the DFT of different data."
