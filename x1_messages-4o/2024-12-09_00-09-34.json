        "content": "To achieve the task of replacing verbs and adjectives with antonyms in an R script, you'll need to make use of natural language processing (NLP) libraries and a predefined list of antonyms. Below is an example of how you can approach this problem in R, followed by a SQL code to store and retrieve the word substitution table.\n\n### R Code for Word Substitution with Antonyms\n\n```r\n# Install necessary packages if not already installed\nif (!require(\"textTinyR\")) install.packages(\"textTinyR\", dependencies = TRUE)\n\nlibrary(textTinyR)\n\n# Define a function to replace words with antonyms\nreplace_with_antonyms <- function(sentence, antonyms_table) {\n  # Tokenize the sentence\n  words <- strsplit(sentence, \" \")[[1]]\n  \n  # Replace words with antonyms\n  replaced_words <- sapply(words, function(word) {\n    if (word %in% antonyms_table$word) {\n      return(antonyms_table$antonym[antonyms_table$word == word])\n    }\n    return(word)\n  })\n  \n  # Return the modified sentence\n  return(paste(replaced_words, collapse = \" \"))\n}\n\n# Example antonyms table\nantonyms_table <- data.frame(\n  word = c(\"beautiful\", \"mesmerized\"),\n  antonym = c(\"ugly\", \"bored\")\n)\n\n# Example sentence\nsentence <- \"The beautiful sunset mesmerized John\"\n\n# Replace words with antonyms\nmodified_sentence <- replace_with_antonyms(sentence, antonyms_table)\nprint(modified_sentence)\n```\n\n### Sample Antonyms Table\n\nHere's a basic example of a table mapping words to their antonyms:\n\n| Word       | Antonym    |\n|------------|------------|\n| beautiful  | ugly       |\n| happy      | sad        |\n| strong     | weak       |\n| fast       | slow       |\n| mesmerizing| boring     |\n\nYou can expand this table with more words as needed.\n\n### SQL Code to Store and Retrieve the Word Substitution Table\n\nTo store the word substitution table in a SQL database, you can use the following SQL code. This example assumes you are using SQLite, but it can be adapted to other SQL databases with minor modifications.\n\n```sql\n-- Create the table\nCREATE TABLE WordSubstitution (\n    word TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n    antonym TEXT\n);\n\n-- Insert sample data\nINSERT INTO WordSubstitution (word, antonym) VALUES ('beautiful', 'ugly');\nINSERT INTO WordSubstitution (word, antonym) VALUES ('happy', 'sad');\nINSERT INTO WordSubstitution (word, antonym) VALUES ('strong', 'weak');\nINSERT INTO WordSubstitution (word, antonym) VALUES ('fast', 'slow');\nINSERT INTO WordSubstitution (word, antonym) VALUES ('mesmerizing', 'boring');\n\n-- Query to retrieve the table\nSELECT * FROM WordSubstitution;\n\n-- Query to retrieve an antonym for a specific word\nSELECT antonym FROM WordSubstitution WHERE word = 'beautiful';\n```\n\nThis SQL code creates a `WordSubstitution` table with columns for words and their antonyms. You can insert as many words and antonyms as you need. The queries at the end demonstrate how to retrieve the entire table or just the antonym for a specific word.\n\nThis setup allows you to efficiently manage and utilize word substitutions in both R and SQL environments."
