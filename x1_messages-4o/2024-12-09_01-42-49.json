        "content": "I need to filter a pandas DataFrame, where one of the columns contains lists as elements. Some of these lists are empty, and I want to filter these out. I have tried different methods such as comparing with an empty list, checking if not null, and checking the length of the lists, but none of these work. Here is what I've tried:\n\n```python\ndf[df[\"col\"] != []] # ValueError: Lengths must match to compare\ndf[pd.notnull(df[\"col\"])] # The code doesn't issue an error but the result includes an empty list\ndf[len(df[\"col\"]) != 0] # KeyError: True\n```\nHow can I correctly filter out the rows where the list in the column is empty?"

        "content": "To filter out rows where a column in a pandas DataFrame contains empty lists, you can use the `apply` method to check the length of each list. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {'col': [[], [1, 2, 3], [], [4, 5], [], [6]]}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Filter out rows where the list in 'col' is empty\nfiltered_df = df[df['col'].apply(lambda x: len(x) > 0)]\n\nprint(filtered_df)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The `apply` method is used to apply a function to each element of the DataFrame column.\n- The lambda function `lambda x: len(x) > 0` checks the length of each list, returning `True` for lists that are not empty.\n- The DataFrame is then filtered based on this condition, keeping only rows where the condition is `True`.\n\nThis approach should correctly filter out all rows where the lists in the specified column are empty."
