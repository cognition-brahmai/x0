I'm using PyCharm 2016.2.3, Mac OS X 10.11.1, and Python 3.5. I have a project folder structure as follows:\n```\nproject\n  /somepackage\n    /subpackage\n     __init__.py   \n     bar.py\n   __init__.py\n   foo.py\n```\nIn `foo.py`, I have the following code:\n```\nimport somepackage.subpackage.bar\nprint(\"foo\")\n```\nand in `bar.py`, I have this code:\n```\nprint(\"bar\")\n```\nWhen I run `foo.py` from PyCharm, it works fine and I get the expected output:\n```\nbar\nfoo\n```\nHowever, when I try to run it from terminal, I encounter an ImportError:\n```\n$ pwd\n$ /home/project \n$ python3.5 somepackage/foo.py\nFile \"foo.py\", line 1, in <module>\nimport somepackage.subpackage.bar\nImportError: No module named 'somepackage'\n```\nI have confirmed that I am using the same Python interpreter as PyCharm and I am currently in the folder that contains the `/somepackage` folder. How can I solve this import issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is related to how Python handles module imports and the current working directory. When you run a script from the terminal, Python does not automatically add the parent directory of the script to the module search path, so it can't find `somepackage`.\n\nIn PyCharm, the IDE automatically configures the environment so that the project root is in the Python path, which is why it works there.\n\nTo solve this issue when running from the terminal, you have a few options:\n\n1. **Modify the PYTHONPATH Environment Variable:**\n\n   You can temporarily add the project directory to the `PYTHONPATH` when running the script. Use the following command in the terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   PYTHONPATH=/home/project python3.5 somepackage/foo.py\n   ```\n\n   This tells Python to include the `/home/project` directory in its search path for modules.\n\n2. **Use the `-m` Option:**\n\n   Run the module using the `-m` flag which treats the directory as a package. You need to navigate to the directory just above `somepackage` and run:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.5 -m somepackage.foo\n   ```\n\n   This requires that your `foo.py` is importable as a module, which should be the case with your current structure.\n\n3. **Modify `sys.path` in Your Script:**\n\n   You can programmatically add the project directory to `sys.path` at the beginning of your `foo.py` script:\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   import os\n\n   sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..')))\n   import somepackage.subpackage.bar\n   print(\"foo\")\n   ```\n\n   This inserts the parent directory of `foo.py` into the module search path, allowing imports to work as expected.\n\nChoose the option that best fits your development workflow. The `PYTHONPATH` method is a quick fix for local testing, while updating `sys.path` in your script can make it more portable across different environments."
