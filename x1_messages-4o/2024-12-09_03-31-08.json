I am uncertain about where in my setup.py I should add these dependencies. My current setup.py looks like this:\n\n```python\n[...]\n'version': '0.0.1',\n'install_requires': [],\n'tests_require': ['pytest'],\n'cmdclass': {'test': PyTest},\n'extras_require': {\n    'testing': ['pytest'],\n},\n[...]\n```\n\nI've noticed that I'm already using `pytest` twice which feels a bit strange and I'm unsure about where to include numpy. Should `pytest` and other similar dependencies go in `tests_require[]` or `extras_require{testing[]}`?"

        "content": "In a `setup.py` file, it's common to define dependencies in a way that makes it easy to manage and install them based on different scenarios, such as installation for development, testing, or production. Here's how you can organize your dependencies:\n\n1. **`install_requires`**: This is where you list the packages required to run your program. These are the packages that will be installed when someone installs your package using pip.\n\n2. **`tests_require`**: This is a legacy field that specifies the dependencies needed for running the tests when using `python setup.py test`. However, it's considered somewhat outdated and not recommended for new projects. Instead, it's better to use `extras_require`.\n\n3. **`extras_require`**: This is a more flexible way to specify optional dependencies. You can define different groups of dependencies for different purposes, such as testing or development.\n\nGiven your scenario, it's best to use `extras_require` for your testing dependencies. This allows users to install testing dependencies easily with the `testing` option, and it avoids redundancy. Here's how you can adjust your `setup.py`:\n\n```python\nfrom setuptools import setup\n\nsetup(\n    # other setup arguments,\n    version='0.0.1',\n    install_requires=[\n        # Add runtime dependencies here\n    ],\n    extras_require={\n        'testing': ['pytest', 'numpy'],\n    },\n    cmdclass={'test': PyTest},\n)\n```\n\nIn this setup:\n\n- Use `extras_require['testing']` to include both `pytest` and `numpy` for your testing needs. This allows you to install these dependencies with `pip install .[testing]`.\n\n- Remove `tests_require` as using `extras_require` is the more modern approach.\n\nThis setup makes it clear that `pytest` and `numpy` are only needed for testing purposes and not for running the program itself."
