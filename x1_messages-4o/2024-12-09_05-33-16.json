        "content": "Implementing a timeout on a function call in Python can be achieved using several methods. One common approach is to use the `threading` module, but it can be tricky because Python threads cannot be killed. Instead, a more robust solution involves using the `concurrent.futures` module, which provides a higher-level interface for asynchronously executing function calls.\n\nHere's a basic example of how you can set up a timeout using the `concurrent.futures` module:\n\n```python\nimport concurrent.futures\nimport time\n\ndef my_function():\n    # Simulate a long-running process\n    time.sleep(10)\n    return \"Function completed\"\n\ndef main():\n    timeout_duration = 5  # seconds\n    fallback_result = \"Function timed out and was cancelled\"\n\n    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n        future = executor.submit(my_function)\n        \n        try:\n            result = future.result(timeout=timeout_duration)\n            print(result)\n        except concurrent.futures.TimeoutError:\n            print(fallback_result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **ThreadPoolExecutor**: This creates a pool of threads and allows you to submit function calls to be executed asynchronously.\n- **future.result(timeout=timeout_duration)**: This waits for the function to complete. If it takes longer than the specified `timeout_duration`, a `TimeoutError` is raised.\n- **Timeout Handling**: If the function exceeds the timeout, you can handle it in the `except` block and execute alternative logic or provide a fallback result.\n\nKeep in mind that this approach doesn't actually \"kill\" the function that's running; it simply stops waiting for it and moves on. The function may still be running in the background, but in many cases, this is acceptable, especially when running in a separate thread where its completion or non-completion does not affect the main program flow."
