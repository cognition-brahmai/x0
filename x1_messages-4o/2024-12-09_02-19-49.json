I have tried to point to the kernel source path with the command `$ ./cuda_7.5.18_linux.run --kernel-source-path=/usr/src/kernels/3.10.0-327.18.2.el7.x86_64` but I encounter the same problem. I have verified that my kernel version is not mismatched and have also tried to install different versions of gcc. Any suggestions on how to resolve this issue?"

        "content": "Installing CUDA on CentOS can sometimes be tricky, especially with the kernel source issues. Let's go through a checklist and potential solutions to get CUDA 7.5 installed on your CentOS 7 system.\n\n### 1. Verify Kernel Headers\nEnsure that you have the correct kernel headers installed that match your running kernel version. You can check your current kernel version using:\n\n```bash\nuname -r\n```\n\nThen, install the kernel headers:\n\n```bash\nsudo yum install kernel-devel-$(uname -r) kernel-headers-$(uname -r)\n```\n\n### 2. Ensure Proper GCC Version\nCUDA 7.5 is compatible with GCC 4.8.x. You can install it using:\n\n```bash\nsudo yum install gcc-4.8.5\n```\n\nEnsure that it's being used by default:\n\n```bash\ngcc --version\n```\n\nIf it's not, you might need to update the alternatives to set GCC 4.8 as the default:\n\n```bash\nsudo alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.8 50\n```\n\n### 3. Create Symlinks for Kernel Sources\nSometimes, the installer might not find the headers due to missing symlinks. You can create them manually:\n\n```bash\nsudo ln -s /usr/src/kernels/$(uname -r) /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build\n```\n\n### 4. Disable Nouveau Driver\nThe Nouveau driver may conflict with NVIDIA drivers. Disable it by creating a configuration file:\n\n```bash\necho \"blacklist nouveau\" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau.conf\necho \"options nouveau modeset=0\" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-nouveau.conf\n```\n\nThen, rebuild the initramfs:\n\n```bash\nsudo dracut --force\n```\n\nReboot your system after this step:\n\n```bash\nsudo reboot\n```\n\n### 5. Retry CUDA Installation\nAfter rebooting, try running the CUDA installer again:\n\n```bash\nsudo sh cuda_7.5.18_linux.run --kernel-source-path=/usr/src/kernels/$(uname -r)\n```\n\n### 6. Check for SELinux Interference\nIf you have SELinux enabled, it might cause issues. For testing, you can temporarily set it to permissive mode:\n\n```bash\nsudo setenforce 0\n```\n\nRemember to set it back to enforcing after the installation:\n\n```bash\nsudo setenforce 1\n```\n\n### 7. Verify Installation\nAfter installation, verify that the NVIDIA driver and CUDA are installed correctly:\n\n```bash\nnvidia-smi\n```\n\nThis command should display information about your NVIDIA GPU.\n\n### Additional Suggestions\n- Make sure your system is fully updated before starting the installation with `sudo yum update`.\n- If you continue to face issues, consult the CUDA installation log typically found in `/var/log/cuda-installer.log` for more detailed error information.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully install CUDA 7.5 on your CentOS 7 system."
