        "content": "To address the issue you're experiencing with importing the Google Cloud Storage library in your Google Cloud Function, you need to make sure that the necessary dependencies are included in your deployment package. Google Cloud Functions allows you to specify dependencies using a `requirements.txt` file. Here\u2019s how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Create a `requirements.txt` file**: This file will list all the Python packages your function depends on. For your specific case, you need to include the `google-cloud-storage` library.\n\n   Create a file named `requirements.txt` with the following content:\n\n   ```\n   google-cloud-storage\n   ```\n\n2. **Deploy your function with the `requirements.txt` file**: When deploying your function, ensure that the `requirements.txt` file is included in the root of your source directory. Google Cloud Functions will automatically install the listed dependencies during deployment.\n\n3. **Deploy the function**: Use the `gcloud` command-line tool to deploy your function. Here\u2019s an example command to deploy your function:\n\n   ```bash\n   gcloud functions deploy log_data \\\n     --runtime python310 \\\n     --trigger-http \\\n     --allow-unauthenticated \\\n     --entry-point log_data\n   ```\n\n   Adjust the command as necessary, depending on your specific environment and requirements.\n\n4. **Verify the function deployment**: After deploying, test your function to ensure it\u2019s working as expected. You can do this by sending an HTTP request to the function's endpoint.\n\n5. **Check IAM permissions**: Ensure that the service account associated with your Cloud Function has the necessary permissions to access the specified Google Cloud Storage bucket. You can grant the `roles/storage.objectAdmin` role to the service account if needed.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the import error and successfully use Google Cloud Storage from within your Google Cloud Function."
