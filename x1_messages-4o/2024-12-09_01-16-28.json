I have a 'Lecture' model in models.py, which includes 'start_date' and 'end_date'. I want to implement custom validation to ensure that the 'start_date' entered in the admin forms is not after the 'end_date'. I attempted to implement this in admin.py using 'clean' function but it does not seem to be working. I am still able to save lectures where 'start_date' is after 'end_date'. What could be the issue with my implementation?\n\nmodels.py:\n```python\n#models.py\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass Lecture(models.Model):\n    topic = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    speaker = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    start_date = models.DateField()\n    end_date = models.DateField()\n```\n\nadmin.py:\n```python\n#admin.py\nfrom models import Lecture\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom django import forms\n\nclass LectureForm(forms.ModelForm):\n    class Meta:\n        model = Lecture\n\n        def clean(self):\n            start_date = self.cleaned_data.get('start_date')\n            end_date = self.cleaned_data.get('end_date')\n            if start_date > end_date:\n                raise forms.ValidationError(\"Dates are incorrect\")\n        return self.cleaned_data\n\nclass LectureAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    form = LectureForm\n    list_display = ('topic', 'speaker', 'start_date', 'end_date')\n\nadmin.site.register(Lecture, LectureAdmin)\n```"

        "content": "The issue with your implementation is that the `clean` method is defined inside the `Meta` class. The `clean` method should be part of the `LectureForm` class itself, not inside the `Meta` class. Here's how you can fix it:\n\n1. Move the `clean` method out of the `Meta` class.\n2. Ensure that you are returning `self.cleaned_data` correctly.\n\nHere is the corrected version of your `admin.py`:\n\n```python\n# admin.py\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom django import forms\nfrom .models import Lecture\n\nclass LectureForm(forms.ModelForm):\n    class Meta:\n        model = Lecture\n        fields = '__all__'  # Ensure you specify the fields\n\n    def clean(self):\n        cleaned_data = super().clean()\n        start_date = cleaned_data.get('start_date')\n        end_date = cleaned_data.get('end_date')\n        \n        if start_date and end_date and start_date > end_date:\n            raise forms.ValidationError(\"Start date cannot be after end date.\")\n        \n        return cleaned_data\n\nclass LectureAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    form = LectureForm\n    list_display = ('topic', 'speaker', 'start_date', 'end_date')\n\nadmin.site.register(Lecture, LectureAdmin)\n```\n\nKey points to note:\n- The `clean` method is now correctly part of the `LectureForm` class.\n- We return `cleaned_data` from the `clean` method.\n- I have also added `fields = '__all__'` in the `Meta` class to ensure all fields are included in the form. Adjust this based on your needs.\n- Make sure to check that there are no typos or indentation errors.\n\nWith these changes, your validation logic should work as expected in the Django admin interface."
