However, I'm encountering an error that states \"pymongo.errors.CursorNotFound: cursor id '...' not valid at server.\" I found a related Stack Overflow post that suggests using `find().batch_size(30)`. Can I use `batch_size` to fetch all the database ids? What does the `find().batch_size(30)` command do?\n\n```python\nclient = MongoClient('xx.xx.xx.xx', xxx)\ndb = client.test_database\ndb = client['...']\ncollection = db.test_collection\ncollection = db[\"...\"]\n\nfor cursor in collection.find({ \"$and\" : [{ \"followers\" : { \"$gt\" : 2000 } }, { \"followers\" : { \"$lt\" : 3000 } }, { \"list_followers\" : { \"$exists\" : False } }] }): \n    print cursor['screenname']\n    print cursor['_id']['uid']\n    id = cursor['_id']['uid']\n```\n\nError:\n\n```python\npymongo.errors.CursorNotFound: cursor id '...' not valid at server\n```"

        "content": "The error `pymongo.errors.CursorNotFound` typically occurs when the cursor times out on the server because the query takes too long, especially if you're dealing with a large dataset. Using `batch_size` can indeed help mitigate this issue by reducing the amount of data fetched in a single round trip to the server, which can prevent the cursor from timing out.\n\nThe `batch_size` method allows you to control the number of documents returned in each batch of results from the server. By setting a smaller `batch_size`, you can reduce the load on the server and allow your application to process documents incrementally, which can help to avoid cursor timeouts.\n\nHere's how you can use `batch_size` in your code:\n\n```python\nclient = MongoClient('xx.xx.xx.xx', xxx)\ndb = client.test_database\ncollection = db['...']\n\n# Using batch_size to control the number of documents fetched per batch\nbatch_size = 30  # You can adjust this number based on your needs\n\ncursor = collection.find({ \n    \"$and\" : [\n        { \"followers\" : { \"$gt\" : 2000 } }, \n        { \"followers\" : { \"$lt\" : 3000 } }, \n        { \"list_followers\" : { \"$exists\" : False } }\n    ]\n}).batch_size(batch_size)\n\nfor document in cursor:\n    print(document['screenname'])\n    print(document['_id']['uid'])\n    id = document['_id']['uid']\n```\n\nBy setting the batch size, you ensure that the client doesn't fetch too many documents at once, which can help in preventing the `CursorNotFound` error. However, keep in mind that setting the batch size too low might increase the number of round trips to the server, which could impact performance. You'll need to find a balance that works for your specific use case.\n\nAdditionally, you might want to check the `cursorTimeoutMillis` setting on your MongoDB server and adjust it if necessary. This setting controls how long a cursor can remain idle before the server automatically closes it."
