        "content": "The difference you're observing is due to how list comprehensions are designed to work in Python and how the `print()` function behaves.\n\n1. **List Comprehensions**:\n   - In Python, list comprehensions are used to construct a new list by applying an expression to each item in an iterable (like a list). \n   - They are generally used for creating a new list by transforming the items, not for executing statements with side effects like printing.\n\n2. **`print()` in List Comprehensions**:\n   - The `print()` function outputs to the console and returns `None`. When you use `print()` in a list comprehension, it will execute and print the items correctly. However, the list comprehension itself is constructing a list of `None` values, which is often not the intended use of list comprehensions.\n   - This is why we often see the use of list comprehensions for expressions that return something useful (like transformations), rather than functions with side effects.\n\n3. **No SyntaxError from `print()`**:\n   - You mentioned receiving a `SyntaxError`, but in Python 3, using `print()` inside a list comprehension should not cause a `SyntaxError`. If you're seeing a `SyntaxError`, it might be due to some other issue in your code or environment. Make sure you are using Python 3, as `print` was a statement in Python 2, not a function, and using `print` in Python 2 within a list comprehension would indeed cause a syntax error.\n\n4. **Using Functions in List Comprehensions**:\n   - When you use a function like `my_func()` that contains `print()`, the function is called for its side effect (printing) within the list comprehension. The comprehension still constructs a list of `None` values, but since you are primarily interested in the side effect (printing), this is fine.\n\nIf you are only interested in the side effect of printing and don't need to construct a list, you might want to use a simple loop instead:\n\n```python\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3]\nfor my_item in my_list:\n    print(my_item)\n```\n\nThis avoids creating an unnecessary list of `None` values and is more idiomatic for cases where you're only interested in side effects like printing."
