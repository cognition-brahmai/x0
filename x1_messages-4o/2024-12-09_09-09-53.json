Below is a Java program that outputs all the prime numbers up to a given integer using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which is an efficient way to find all primes up to a specified limit.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class PrimeNumbers {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        System.out.print(\"Enter an integer to find all prime numbers up to that number: \");\n        int limit = scanner.nextInt();\n        scanner.close();\n\n        boolean[] isPrime = new boolean[limit + 1];\n        for (int i = 2; i <= limit; i++) {\n            isPrime[i] = true;\n        }\n\n        for (int i = 2; i * i <= limit; i++) {\n            if (isPrime[i]) {\n                for (int j = i * i; j <= limit; j += i) {\n                    isPrime[j] = false;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(\"Prime numbers up to \" + limit + \" are:\");\n        for (int i = 2; i <= limit; i++) {\n            if (isPrime[i]) {\n                System.out.print(i + \" \");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### How It Works:\n1. **Initialization**: Create a boolean array `isPrime` with a size of `limit + 1`. This array will keep track of whether each number up to the limit is prime.\n2. **Mark All Numbers as Prime**: Initially, mark all numbers as prime by setting `isPrime[i] = true` for each number from 2 to `limit`.\n3. **Sieve Algorithm**:\n   - For each number `i` starting from 2, if it is still marked as prime, mark all its multiples as non-prime (i.e., `false`).\n   - Continue this process up to the square root of the limit.\n4. **Output Primes**: Loop through the `isPrime` array and print all numbers that remain marked as true.\n\nYou can run this program, input a positive integer, and it will display all prime numbers up to that integer."
