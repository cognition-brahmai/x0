My DataFrame has a date index and looks like this:\n\n```python\n            value\ndate    \n1986-01-31  22.93\n1986-02-28  15.46\n```\n\nI would like to adjust the dates so they look like this:\n\n```python\n            value\ndate    \n1986-01-01  22.93\n1986-02-01  15.46\n```\n\nI have tried using the `floor` function in pandas, but I get a `ValueError: <MonthEnd> is a non-fixed frequency`. I believe this may be because the DataFrame was generated using the `df.resample(\"M\").sum()` function. I have also tried using `df.resample(\"M\", convention='start').sum()`, but this does not work. In R, I know it is easy to achieve this by calling `floor(date, 'M')`. How can I do this in pandas?"

        "content": "To adjust the dates in your pandas DataFrame to represent the first day of each month, you can use the `pd.to_datetime` function along with the `strftime` method to convert the dates to the first day of the month. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'value': [22.93, 15.46],\n}\nindex = pd.to_datetime(['1986-01-31', '1986-02-28'])\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data, index=index)\n\n# Adjust the dates to the first day of each month\ndf.index = df.index.to_period('M').to_timestamp()\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `df.index.to_period('M')` converts the date index to a period with a monthly frequency.\n- `.to_timestamp()` then converts these periods to timestamps, setting them to the start of the period by default, which is the first day of the month.\n\nThis will give you the desired output:\n\n```plaintext\n            value\ndate             \n1986-01-01  22.93\n1986-02-01  15.46\n```\n\nThis method effectively floors each date to the beginning of the month, similar to the functionality you mentioned in R."
