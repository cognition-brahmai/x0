        "content": "To modify the PHP code to include a filter for apartment listings based on the distance from a certain location and display the distance along with other apartment features, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Add a Location Field**: Ensure that your apartment listings have latitude and longitude fields in your database to calculate the distance from a specific location.\n\n2. **Calculate Distance**: Use the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between the given location and each apartment's location. This can be done in SQL if you're using a database like MySQL.\n\n3. **Modify Your Query**: Update your SQL query to include the distance calculation and filter based on the maximum distance.\n\n4. **Display the Distance**: Update your PHP code to fetch and display the calculated distance along with the other apartment features.\n\nHere's a basic example of how you might implement this:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// User-specified location (latitude and longitude)\n$userLatitude = 28.6139; // Example: New Delhi Latitude\n$userLongitude = 77.2090; // Example: New Delhi Longitude\n\n// Maximum distance in kilometers\n$maxDistance = 10;\n\n// Connect to your database\n$pdo = new PDO('mysql:host=your_host;dbname=your_db', 'username', 'password');\n\n// SQL query to calculate distance using the Haversine formula\n$sql = \"\n    SELECT *,\n    (6371 * acos(\n        cos(radians(:userLatitude)) *\n        cos(radians(latitude)) *\n        cos(radians(longitude) - radians(:userLongitude)) +\n        sin(radians(:userLatitude)) *\n        sin(radians(latitude))\n    )) AS distance\n    FROM apartments\n    HAVING distance <= :maxDistance\n    ORDER BY distance\n\";\n\n// Prepare and execute the statement\n$stmt = $pdo->prepare($sql);\n$stmt->execute([\n    ':userLatitude' => $userLatitude,\n    ':userLongitude' => $userLongitude,\n    ':maxDistance' => $maxDistance\n]);\n\n// Fetch and display results\n$apartments = $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);\nforeach ($apartments as $apartment) {\n    echo \"Apartment: \" . $apartment['name'] . \"<br>\";\n    echo \"Distance: \" . round($apartment['distance'], 2) . \" km<br>\";\n    echo \"Features: \" . $apartment['features'] . \"<br>\";\n    echo \"<hr>\";\n}\n?>\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Haversine Formula**: This formula is used to calculate the great-circle distance between two points on the Earth based on their latitude and longitude.\n\n- **SQL HAVING Clause**: It's used to filter records that are calculated by aggregate functions like the distance in this case.\n\n- **Security**: Always ensure your database queries are secure by using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.\n\n- **Optimization**: Depending on the size of your dataset, you might need to optimize this query for performance, possibly by adding spatial indexes or using more advanced geospatial capabilities if your database supports them.\n\nThis approach will allow you to filter apartment listings based on proximity to a specific location and provide users with the distance information in a meaningful way."
