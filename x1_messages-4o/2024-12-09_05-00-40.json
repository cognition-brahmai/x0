I've come across a post that demonstrates how to find the nearest date which is not before the given date. But, how can I modify this code to also consider dates that precede the given date? As an example, if the array contained elements `datetime.datetime(2014,12,10)` and `datetime.datetime(2014,12,28)`, the former should be returned because it is closest to `datetime.datetime(2014,12,16)` in absolute terms."

The date with the smallest absolute difference is the closest date. Here's a Python code snippet to achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef find_closest_date(dates, target_date):\n    # Calculate the absolute difference between each date and the target date\n    closest_date = min(dates, key=lambda date: abs(date - target_date))\n    return closest_date\n\n# Example usage\ndates = [\n    datetime(2014, 12, 10),\n    datetime(2014, 12, 28),\n    datetime(2014, 12, 1),\n    datetime(2015, 1, 5)\n]\n\ntarget_date = datetime(2014, 12, 16)\n\nclosest_date = find_closest_date(dates, target_date)\nprint(\"The closest date is:\", closest_date)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1. We define a function `find_closest_date` that takes a list of datetime objects (`dates`) and a target datetime object (`target_date`).\n\n2. We use Python's built-in `min` function with a key argument, which uses a lambda function to compute the absolute difference between each date in the list and the target date.\n\n3. The function returns the date with the smallest absolute difference.\n\nWhen you run this code, it should correctly identify `datetime(2014, 12, 10)` as the closest date to `datetime(2014, 12, 16)` from your example list."
