        "content": "Creating a Python program to generate a multiplication table is a straightforward task. Below is a simple example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef generate_multiplication_table(number, up_to=10):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a multiplication table for a given number up to a specified range.\n\n    :param number: The number for which to generate the multiplication table.\n    :param up_to: The range up to which the table should be generated (default is 10).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Multiplication Table for {number}\")\n    for i in range(1, up_to + 1):\n        result = number * i\n        print(f\"{number} x {i} = {result}\")\n\n# Example usage\nnum = int(input(\"Enter the number for which you want the multiplication table: \"))\ngenerate_multiplication_table(num)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `generate_multiplication_table` takes two parameters:\n   - `number`: The base number for which you want to generate the table.\n   - `up_to`: The number up to which you want the multiplication to go. By default, it's set to 10.\n\n2. **Loop to Generate Table**: A `for` loop is used, iterating from 1 to the specified `up_to` number (inclusive). In each iteration, it calculates the product of the `number` and the current loop index `i`.\n\n3. **Output**: The result of the multiplication is printed in a formatted string showing the multiplicand, multiplier, and product.\n\n4. **User Input**: The program takes input from the user to specify the number for which the multiplication table is needed.\n\nYou can easily modify this program to customize the range or format the output as needed."
