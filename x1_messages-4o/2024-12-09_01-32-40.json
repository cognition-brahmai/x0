I am trying to apply regex on the following lines of text using the f-string and raw strings together:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nlines = '''\n\n    04/20/2009; 04/20/09; 4/20/09; 4/3/09\n    Mar-20-2009; Mar 20, 2009; March 20, 2009; Mar. 20, 2009; Mar 20 2009;\n    20 Mar 2009; 20 March 2009; 20 Mar. 2009; 20 March, 2009\n    Mar 20th, 2009; Mar 21st, 2009; Mar 22nd, 2009\n    Feb 2009; Sep 2009; Oct 2010\n    6/2008; 12/2009\n    2009; 2010\n\n'''\nrmonth = 'a'\nregex = fr'(\\d{1,2})/(\\d{1,2})/(\\d{4}|\\d{2})'\ndate_found = re.findall(regex, lines)\n\ndate_found\n```\n\nIs there a way to make f-strings work with raw strings for regex in Python?"

        "content": "In Python, you can combine f-strings and raw strings by using both `f` and `r` together, as you have done in your example. This allows you to interpolate variables into your regex pattern while maintaining the raw string behavior, which is crucial for regex patterns to work correctly.\n\nThe issue with your code might not be due to the use of f-strings and raw strings together but could be related to the regex pattern or the variable you are interpolating. Let's go through your code and make sure everything is set up correctly.\n\nHere's your code with a small modification to ensure it works as expected:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nlines = '''\n\n    04/20/2009; 04/20/09; 4/20/09; 4/3/09\n    Mar-20-2009; Mar 20, 2009; March 20, 2009; Mar. 20, 2009; Mar 20 2009;\n    20 Mar 2009; 20 March 2009; 20 Mar. 2009; 20 March, 2009\n    Mar 20th, 2009; Mar 21st, 2009; Mar 22nd, 2009\n    Feb 2009; Sep 2009; Oct 2010\n    6/2008; 12/2009\n    2009; 2010\n\n'''\n\nrmonth = 'a'  # This variable is not used in your regex, so it doesn't affect the current regex pattern.\nregex = fr'(\\d{{1,2}})/(\\d{{1,2}})/(\\d{{4}}|\\d{{2}})'  # Use double curly braces for literal braces in f-strings\n\ndate_found = re.findall(regex, lines)\n\ndate_found\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Double Curly Braces**: When using f-strings and you need literal curly braces, such as in regex patterns, you should use double curly braces (`{{` and `}}`). This is because single curly braces are used for variable interpolation in f-strings.\n\n2. **Regex Pattern**: Make sure your regex pattern is correctly designed for the text you are parsing. In this case, your pattern seems suitable for matching dates in the format `MM/DD/YYYY` or `MM/DD/YY`.\n\n3. **Unused Variable**: The `rmonth` variable is declared but not used in the regex pattern. If you intended to use it for something specific, you should incorporate it into the regex or remove it if unnecessary.\n\nBy using `fr'...'`, you ensure both raw string behavior and f-string interpolation, which should work without issues as long as the pattern and variable usage are correct."
