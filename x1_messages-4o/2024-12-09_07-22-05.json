The other way is by calling \"python batch.py -file-\" that overlooks all the simplified input gathering and executes an entire file's worth of input through the program at once. However, when I run \"batch.py\", it imports some variables/methods from \"main.py\". While doing so, it tries to run the code in \"main.py\" and gives an error. Here's the import statement I used:\n\n```python\nimport main\n```\n\nHow can I prevent Python from executing the code contained in the \"main\" module during import?"

        "content": "To prevent Python from executing certain parts of the code in your `main.py` when it is imported by another module like `batch.py`, you can use the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` construct. This is a common Python idiom that checks whether the script is being run directly or being imported as a module. Only the code inside this block will be executed when the script is run directly.\n\nHere's how you can modify your `main.py`:\n\n```python\ndef some_function():\n    # Your function code here\n    pass\n\n# Add more functions or classes as needed\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Code inside this block will only run if the script is executed directly.\n    # Place the code that should only run when executing this script directly here.\n    # For example, your input prompt and processing logic.\n    \n    # Example:\n    user_input = input(\"Enter your input: \")\n    result = some_function(user_input)\n    print(result)\n```\n\nBy doing this, when `main.py` is imported in `batch.py`, the code within the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block will not be executed. Only the functions and classes defined outside this block will be available for use in `batch.py`.\n\nYour `batch.py` can then import and use the functions from `main.py` without triggering any execution of `main.py`'s direct execution code:\n\n```python\nimport main\n\n# Now you can use functions or classes from main\nresult = main.some_function(some_argument)\n```\n\nThis way, `batch.py` can utilize the functionality from `main.py` without encountering unintended code execution."
