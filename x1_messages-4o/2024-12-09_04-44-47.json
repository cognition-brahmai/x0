I have a model named Task in model.py, which has a FileField named 'seq_file'. Here's the model:\n\n```python\nclass Task(models.Model):\n    ...\n    seq_file = models.FileField(upload_to='files/', blank=True, null=True)\n    ...\n```\n\nIn ajax.py, I'm trying to open 'seq_file' with open() method:\n\n```python\n...\ndef startTask(request, name):\n    task = Task.objects.get(task_name=name)\n    data = task.seq_file.open()\n    filename = os.path.join(settings.MEDIA_ROOT ,task.seq_file.name)\n    if not os.path.isfile(filename):\n        raise Exception, \"file \" + filename + \" not found.\"\n    sequences = parser.parse(data.read())\n    ...\n```\n\nBut it throws an error:\n\n```python\nFile \"/home/mnowotka/Dokumenty/MgrFuncAdnot/app/django-gui/src/gui/ajax.py\", line 43, in startTask\nsequences = parser.parse(data.read())\n\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'read'\n```\n\nHowever, when I open 'seq_file' by directly using file path, it works perfectly:\n\n```python\n...\ndef startTask(request, name):\n    task = Task.objects.get(task_name=name)\n    filename = os.path.join(settings.MEDIA_ROOT ,task.seq_file.name)\n    if not os.path.isfile(filename):\n        raise Exception, \"file \" + filename + \" not found.\"\n    data = open(filename)  \n    sequences = parser.parse(data.read())\n    ...\n```\n\nWhy is this happening?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering stems from a misunderstanding of how the `open()` method works on a `FileField` in Django. In Django 1.3 (and actually in later versions as well), the `open()` method on a `FileField` doesn't return the file object itself. Instead, it opens the file, and you should access the file using the field's `file` attribute. Let's break it down:\n\n### Correct Usage\n\n1. **Opening the File:**\n   The `open()` method is used to open the file. However, it doesn't return the file object. Instead, you should access the file object through the `file` attribute of the `FileField`.\n\n2. **Accessing the File:**\n   After calling `open()`, you can interact with the file using the `file` attribute.\n\n### Modified Code\n\nHere's how you should modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom django.conf import settings\n\ndef startTask(request, name):\n    task = Task.objects.get(task_name=name)\n    \n    # Ensure the file exists\n    filename = os.path.join(settings.MEDIA_ROOT, task.seq_file.name)\n    if not os.path.isfile(filename):\n        raise Exception(\"file \" + filename + \" not found.\")\n    \n    # Open the file using the FileField method\n    task.seq_file.open()\n    \n    # Accessing the file object through the 'file' attribute\n    data = task.seq_file.file\n    \n    # Now you can read and parse the file\n    sequences = parser.parse(data.read())\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **`task.seq_file.open()`**: This opens the file associated with `seq_file`. It prepares the file for reading, but doesn't return the file object.\n\n- **`task.seq_file.file`**: This is the actual file object you want to interact with. After calling `open()`, you can perform operations like `read()` on this object.\n\nBy following this approach, you should be able to read the file correctly and avoid the `AttributeError` you were encountering."
