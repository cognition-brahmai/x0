        "content": "Managing different kernel versions for various architectures can indeed be a bit challenging, but there are strategies to handle this efficiently without having to maintain separate files for each architecture.\n\n### 1. **Using `#ifdef` Directives:**\nYou can use preprocessor directives to conditionally compile different sections of your kernel code based on the target architecture. CUDA provides several predefined macros that can be used for this purpose, such as `__CUDA_ARCH__` to determine the compute capability.\n\n```cpp\n__global__ void myKernel() {\n    #if __CUDA_ARCH__ >= 700\n        // Code specific to architectures 7.0 and above\n    #elif __CUDA_ARCH__ >= 600\n        // Code specific to architectures 6.0 to 6.9\n    #else\n        // Code for architectures below 6.0\n    #endif\n}\n```\n\n### 2. **Fat Binaries:**\nCUDA supports the creation of fat binaries, which allows you to compile your code for multiple architectures in a single binary. You can specify multiple architectures using the `-arch` flag with `nvcc`:\n\n```bash\nnvcc -arch=sm_60 -arch=sm_70 -arch=sm_80 your_code.cu -o output\n```\n\nThis will compile your code for the specified architectures, and the CUDA runtime will automatically choose the best-matching architecture on the target platform.\n\n### 3. **Separate Compilation and Linking:**\nYou can compile your kernels separately for different architectures and then link them together. This involves using the `-dc` option for device code compilation and `-dlink` for device linking.\n\n### 4. **Template Specialization:**\nIf your kernel logic varies significantly between architectures, you might use C++ templates with specialization for each architecture:\n\n```cpp\ntemplate<int ARCH>\n__global__ void myKernel();\n\ntemplate<>\n__global__ void myKernel<700>() {\n    // Code for architecture 7.0\n}\n\ntemplate<>\n__global__ void myKernel<600>() {\n    // Code for architecture 6.0\n}\n\n// Call the appropriate kernel\nmyKernel<__CUDA_ARCH__><<<blocks, threads>>>();\n```\n\n### 5. **CMake or Build Scripts:**\nYou can use build systems like CMake to automate the process of compiling different versions of your kernels for different architectures by setting up different targets.\n\nThese methods help maintain a single source file while supporting multiple architectures, making your codebase cleaner and easier to maintain. Choose the method that best fits your project's complexity and requirements."
