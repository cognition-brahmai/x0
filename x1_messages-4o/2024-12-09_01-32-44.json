It does not automatically configure itself for Anaconda.\n   - You can use it for general purposes, but to use `conda` commands, you might have to manually set up the environment by navigating to the Anaconda installation directory and activating the base environment.\n\nFor updating a package using a command like `conda update conda`, you should use the **Anaconda Prompt**. This ensures that the correct environment is activated and all necessary paths and environment variables are set up, allowing `conda` to function properly."
