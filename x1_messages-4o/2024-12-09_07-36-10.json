In a scenario where I am running a loop and producing a figure at the end of each iteration, which is then saved, will using plt.clf() and plt.close() have the same impact? I noticed that in the first couple tries, the plots were retaining the old figures in every subsequent plot. I want to have unique plots for each iteration without retaining the old figures. Does it matter which function I use? The calculation I'm running takes a very long time and it would be very time consuming to test it out."

        "content": "In `matplotlib.pyplot`, `plt.clf()` and `plt.close()` serve different purposes, and understanding these differences can help you manage your plots effectively in a loop.\n\n1. **`plt.clf()` (Clear Figure):**\n   - `plt.clf()` clears the current figure's content but keeps the figure window open. It essentially removes all the current axes, lines, labels, and other elements from the figure, allowing you to reuse the figure window for a new plot.\n   - This is useful when you want to update the content of the figure without closing the figure window itself.\n\n2. **`plt.close()` (Close Figure):**\n   - `plt.close()` closes the entire figure window. After calling this function, you cannot reuse the same figure window unless you create a new one. It frees up the memory associated with the figure.\n   - This is useful when you want to completely release all resources associated with the figure and start fresh with a new figure window.\n\nIn your scenario, where you are running a loop to produce and save a new figure at the end of each iteration, you should use `plt.close()` after saving the plot. This will ensure that each iteration starts with a completely new figure and that no old figure elements are retained.\n\nHere's an example of how you might structure your loop:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nfor i in range(num_iterations):\n    # Perform calculations\n    # Plot your data\n    plt.plot(data)\n\n    # Save the figure\n    plt.savefig(f'plot_{i}.png')\n\n    # Close the figure to free up memory and start fresh in the next iteration\n    plt.close()\n```\n\nUsing `plt.close()` ensures that each plot is unique and that memory is efficiently managed, which is especially important if your calculations are time-consuming and resource-intensive."
