        "content": "I'm currently developing in Django and I'm working with a model called \"Status\" that has an integer field called \"code\" and a CharField called \"text\". There are approximately 10 pre-defined code/text pairs stored in the database. However, I've been noticing that throughout the codebase there are instances where status is being defined using Status.objects.get(code=x). I want to simplify this by having a method for each status so that I can call status as Status.successful() or Status.failed(). Is this possible in Python? I haven't found a way to do it using Manager in Django. In other languages like Java or Ruby, it could be achieved easily with a static method or by defining a method on self respectively. How can I achieve this in Python/Django?"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this in Django by extending the `Manager` class to include custom methods for each predefined status. This approach allows you to encapsulate the logic for retrieving specific status instances in one place, keeping your codebase clean and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n1. **Create a custom manager**: Define a custom manager that includes methods for each of your predefined status codes.\n\n2. **Attach the manager to your model**: Use the custom manager in your model.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass StatusManager(models.Manager):\n    def successful(self):\n        return self.get(code=1)  # Assuming 1 is the code for 'successful'\n\n    def failed(self):\n        return self.get(code=2)  # Assuming 2 is the code for 'failed'\n\n    # Add more methods for other status codes as needed\n    def pending(self):\n        return self.get(code=3)  # Assuming 3 is the code for 'pending'\n\nclass Status(models.Model):\n    code = models.IntegerField()\n    text = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n\n    objects = StatusManager()\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return self.text\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nYou can now use these methods anywhere in your codebase to retrieve the status instances:\n\n```python\nsuccess_status = Status.objects.successful()\nfailed_status = Status.objects.failed()\npending_status = Status.objects.pending()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Custom Manager**: The `StatusManager` class extends `models.Manager` and includes methods like `successful`, `failed`, and `pending`. Each method uses `self.get()` to retrieve the `Status` object with the corresponding code.\n\n- **Model Association**: The `Status` model uses `StatusManager` as its manager. This allows you to call the custom methods defined in `StatusManager` using `Status.objects`.\n\nThis approach centralizes the logic for retrieving status objects and makes your codebase cleaner and easier to maintain. You can add more methods to the `StatusManager` for other predefined status codes as needed."
