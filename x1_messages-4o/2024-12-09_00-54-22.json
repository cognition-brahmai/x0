        "content": "It sounds like you're experiencing an issue with `pip` on your Python 3.5 installation. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the problem:\n\n1. **Upgrade pip:** Sometimes, older versions of `pip` can have issues. Open your command prompt and try upgrading `pip` with the following command:\n   ```\n   python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Your Internet Connection:** Ensure that you have a stable internet connection, as `pip` requires internet access to download packages.\n\n3. **Use a Different Package Index Mirror:** Sometimes the default Python Package Index (PyPI) server might be slow or unresponsive. You can try using a different mirror by running:\n   ```\n   pip install <package-name> --index-url https://pypi.org/simple\n   ```\n\n4. **Disable Antivirus/Firewall Temporarily:** Sometimes antivirus or firewall software can interfere with `pip`. Try temporarily disabling them to see if that resolves the issue.\n\n5. **Clear pip Cache:** Corrupted cache files can sometimes cause issues. Clear `pip`'s cache by running:\n   ```\n   pip cache purge\n   ```\n\n6. **Check for Proxy Settings:** If you're behind a proxy, you might need to configure `pip` to use it. You can set the proxy in the command line like this:\n   ```\n   pip install <package-name> --proxy http://user:pass@proxyserver:port\n   ```\n\n7. **Verify Python and pip Paths:** Make sure that the paths to Python and `pip` are set correctly in your system\u2019s environment variables. You can check this by running:\n   ```\n   where python\n   where pip\n   ```\n\n8. **Reinstall Python:** If none of the above solutions work, consider reinstalling Python. Make sure to download the latest version of Python 3.5.x (if you need to stay on 3.5) from the official Python website and check the option to add Python to your PATH during installation.\n\n9. **Check for Specific Package Issues:** If the problem occurs with only a specific package, there might be an issue with that package's distribution. Check the package's documentation or support channels for any known issues or solutions.\n\n10. **Use Virtual Environment:** Sometimes using a virtual environment can resolve installation conflicts. Create a virtual environment and try installing the package within it:\n    ```\n    python -m venv myenv\n    myenv\\Scripts\\activate\n    pip install <package-name>\n    ```\n\nTry these steps, and hopefully, one of them will resolve the issue with `pip` hanging."
