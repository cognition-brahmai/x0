Below is a high-level guide to help you get started:\n\n### Step 1: Plan Your Application\n1. **Define Requirements**: Decide on the features you want your application to have, such as search by keyword or ISBN, displaying book details, and possibly user accounts for saving favorites.\n2. **Choose a Technology Stack**: Decide on the front-end and back-end technologies you'll use. Common choices include:\n   - **Front-end**: HTML/CSS, JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.\n   - **Back-end**: Node.js, Django, Flask, Ruby on Rails, etc.\n   - **Database**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.\n\n### Step 2: Set Up Your Development Environment\n1. **Install Necessary Tools**: Install a code editor (e.g., VSCode), and set up version control with Git.\n2. **Set Up Your Project**: Use a package manager like npm (for Node.js) to initialize your project and manage dependencies.\n\n### Step 3: Develop the Back-end\n1. **API for Book Data**: Use a third-party API like Google Books API or Open Library API to fetch book data based on keywords or ISBN.\n   - Register for an API key if required.\n   - Write server-side code to handle API requests and responses.\n\n2. **Create Endpoints**: Define RESTful API endpoints in your back-end to handle search requests, e.g., `/search?keyword=...` or `/search?isbn=...`.\n\n### Step 4: Develop the Front-end\n1. **Design the UI**: Create a user-friendly interface with input fields for keyword and ISBN searches.\n2. **Fetch Data from the Back-end**: Use AJAX or fetch API to send requests to your back-end endpoints and display the results.\n3. **Display Results**: Render the book data dynamically using your chosen front-end framework.\n\n### Step 5: Add Additional Features\n1. **Pagination**: Implement pagination for search results if necessary.\n2. **User Accounts**: Allow users to create accounts and save favorite books.\n3. **Responsive Design**: Ensure your web application is mobile-friendly.\n\n### Step 6: Testing and Deployment\n1. **Test Your Application**: Conduct thorough testing to ensure all features work as expected.\n2. **Deploy Your Application**: Choose a hosting provider like Heroku, AWS, or Vercel to deploy your application.\n\n### Step 7: Maintain and Update\n1. **Monitor Performance**: Use analytics tools to monitor user interaction and performance.\n2. **Update Regularly**: Keep your application updated with the latest book data and software patches.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to create a functional web application that allows users to search for books by entering a keyword or ISBN. Good luck with your project!"
