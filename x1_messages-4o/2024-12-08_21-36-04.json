Here's the starting code:\nfunction getIconName() {\n  // [JavaScript code]\n}\nTo retrieve the icon's name, you can use the following JavaScript code:\nconst icon = {\n  name: \"Steve Jobs\"\n};\nfunction getIconName() {\n  return icon.name;\n}\nIs there a more efficient way to retrieve the icon's name using JavaScript?"

However, if you want to further simplify or modify it slightly, you can make use of destructuring in JavaScript to achieve the same result in a slightly different way. Here is an example:\n\n```javascript\nconst icon = { name: \"Steve Jobs\" };\n\nfunction getIconName() {\n  const { name } = icon;\n  return name;\n}\n```\n\nThis method utilizes object destructuring to extract the `name` property from the `icon` object. It's a more modern way to achieve the same outcome, but in terms of performance, both approaches are effectively the same given the simplicity of the task."
