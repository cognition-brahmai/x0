Currently, I have to manually adjust the script display for each script every time I open Spyder, which is slightly annoying. I've tried looking in the Spyder preferences and doing a Google search, but I haven't found any helpful information."

        "content": "Yes, you can set or change the default script window scale in Spyder by adjusting the font size and interface scaling settings. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Open Spyder Preferences**: You can access this by clicking on `Tools` in the menu bar and then selecting `Preferences`. Alternatively, you can use the shortcut `Ctrl + Alt + P` (or `Cmd + ,` on macOS).\n\n2. **Adjust Editor Font Size**:\n   - In the Preferences window, go to the `Editor` section on the left sidebar.\n   - Under `Display`, you'll find options to set the `Font size`. Adjust this to your preferred size.\n\n3. **Interface Scaling**:\n   - Still in the Preferences window, navigate to the `General` section.\n   - Look for `Interface`, where you can find an option for `UI Scaling`. Adjust this to change the overall scaling of the Spyder interface.\n\n4. **Apply and Save**:\n   - After making your adjustments, click `Apply` and then `OK` to save your changes.\n\nThese settings should persist across sessions, so you won't have to adjust the script display each time you open Spyder. If you find the text still not scaling as expected, ensure that your system's display settings are also set to a comfortable scale, as these can sometimes affect application-specific scaling."
