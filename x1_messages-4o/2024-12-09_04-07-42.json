I'm not particular about the contents of the new column - it can be empty or filled with zeroes. Here's the initial code I have:\n\n```python\nfrom numpy import genfromtxt\nfrom numpy import recfromcsv\nimport numpy as np\nimport time\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n print(\"testing\")\n my_data = recfromcsv('LIAB.ST.csv', delimiter='\\t')\n array_size = my_data.size\n new_col = np.sum(x,1).reshape((x.shape[0],1))\n np.append(x,new_col,1)\n```"

        "content": "To add a new column to a NumPy array created using `recfromcsv`, first, you'll need to convert the structured array into a regular NumPy array if it's not already. Since `recfromcsv` returns a structured array, you'll need to manipulate it slightly differently. Here's how you can add a ninth column filled with zeros to your array:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    print(\"testing\")\n    my_data = recfromcsv('LIAB.ST.csv', delimiter='\\t')\n\n    # Convert the structured array to a regular 2D array\n    regular_array = np.array(my_data.tolist())\n\n    # Create a new column of zeros\n    new_col = np.zeros((regular_array.shape[0], 1))\n\n    # Append the new column to the existing array\n    updated_array = np.hstack((regular_array, new_col))\n\n    print(updated_array)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what the code does:\n\n1. **Convert Structured Array**: `my_data.tolist()` converts the structured array to a list, and `np.array()` converts that list to a regular 2D NumPy array.\n\n2. **Create New Column**: `np.zeros((regular_array.shape[0], 1))` creates a new column of zeros with the same number of rows as the existing array.\n\n3. **Append New Column**: `np.hstack((regular_array, new_col))` horizontally stacks the original array and the new column, effectively adding the ninth column to the array.\n\nThis approach assumes that all fields in the structured array are of types that can be converted to a regular array. If you have non-numeric fields, you might need to handle them differently."
