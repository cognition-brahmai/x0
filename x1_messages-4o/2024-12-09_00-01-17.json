The program should also include a feature that calculates the carbon footprint of pet ownership and encourages responsible consumption of pet products."

Here\u2019s a conceptual structure for the program:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n\n// Function to solve the riddle\nstd::string solveRiddle() {\n    // Placeholder for riddle answer\n    return \"The answer to the riddle is: A pet from a shelter!\";\n}\n\n// Function to calculate the carbon footprint\ndouble calculateCarbonFootprint(int petCount, double averageFootprintPerPet) {\n    return petCount * averageFootprintPerPet;\n}\n\n// Function to promote pet adoption\nvoid promoteAdoption() {\n    std::cout << \"Adopt, don't shop! Give a loving home to a shelter pet and make a difference.\" << std::endl;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    // Solve the riddle\n    std::string riddleAnswer = solveRiddle();\n    std::cout << riddleAnswer << std::endl;\n\n    // Promote pet adoption\n    promoteAdoption();\n\n    // Calculate and display carbon footprint\n    int petCount;\n    double averageFootprintPerPet;\n    \n    std::cout << \"Enter the number of pets you have: \";\n    std::cin >> petCount;\n    std::cout << \"Enter the average annual carbon footprint per pet (in kg CO2): \";\n    std::cin >> averageFootprintPerPet;\n\n    double totalFootprint = calculateCarbonFootprint(petCount, averageFootprintPerPet);\n    std::cout << \"Total annual carbon footprint of your pets: \" << totalFootprint << \" kg CO2\" << std::endl;\n\n    // Encourage responsible consumption\n    std::cout << \"Reduce your pet's carbon pawprint by choosing sustainable products!\" << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Riddle Solution**: The function `solveRiddle()` returns a placeholder answer to the riddle. You can replace this with the actual answer.\n\n2. **Promote Pet Adoption**: The function `promoteAdoption()` prints a memorable catchphrase encouraging the adoption of pets from shelters.\n\n3. **Carbon Footprint Calculation**: The function `calculateCarbonFootprint()` calculates the carbon footprint based on the number of pets and an average footprint value per pet. The user is prompted to input these values.\n\n4. **Responsible Consumption**: A message is printed encouraging the use of sustainable pet products to reduce environmental impact.\n\nThis program is a basic structure and can be expanded to include more detailed calculations or additional features as needed."
