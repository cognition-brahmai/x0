For example, I use the command `easy_install /path/to/foo.egg` followed by `python -m foo --name World` and I expect to get the output \"Hello World\". However, when I try to execute it, I receive an error saying \"foo is a package and cannot be directly executed\". I have created a `__main__.py` file inside my package but it does not seem to get executed. I am using Python 2.6. My package structure is as follows:\n```\nfoo/\n  setup.py\n  foo/\n    __init__.py\n    __main__.py\n```\nWhen I run `python -m foo.__main__ --name World`, it works as expected but I would prefer the former way of execution. Is it possible to do so?"

        "content": "In Python 2.6, executing a package directly using the `-m` flag is not supported in the same way as it is in later versions of Python, such as Python 3.x. This is why you're encountering the issue. However, there are a few workarounds you can consider to achieve similar functionality.\n\n### Workaround 1: Use a Script Entry Point\n\nYou can define a script entry point in your `setup.py` to create a command-line script that can be executed directly.\n\n1. Edit your `setup.py` to include an entry point:\n\n   ```python\n   from setuptools import setup\n\n   setup(\n       name='foo',\n       version='1.0',\n       packages=['foo'],\n       entry_points={\n           'console_scripts': [\n               'foo = foo.__main__:main',\n           ],\n       },\n   )\n   ```\n\n2. In your `__main__.py`, define a `main` function that will be called:\n\n   ```python\n   # foo/__main__.py\n   import sys\n\n   def main():\n       # Your logic here\n       name = sys.argv[2] if len(sys.argv) > 2 and sys.argv[1] == \"--name\" else \"World\"\n       print(f\"Hello {name}\")\n\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       main()\n   ```\n\n3. Reinstall your package using `python setup.py install` or `pip install .` if you have `pip`.\n\n4. Now you can run the script directly using the command `foo --name World`.\n\n### Workaround 2: Create a Wrapper Script\n\nCreate a small wrapper script that can be executed to achieve the same behavior.\n\n1. Create a file named `run_foo.py` (or any name you prefer) outside your package:\n\n   ```python\n   # run_foo.py\n   from foo.__main__ import main\n\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       main()\n   ```\n\n2. Run this script using `python run_foo.py --name World`.\n\nBy employing either of these methods, you can run your package as a script without directly using `-m` on the package itself."
