        "content": "I'm new to Python, coming from a Matlab background. I'm trying to generate a series of 2 x 5 panel contourf subplots using a loop in Python by converting my Matlab code. However, I'm facing an issue with the positioning of the panels. When I run my code, the first panel appears in the last position where I would expect 259 to be, and 251 seems to be where I want 250 to be placed. They all seem to be in the correct sequence, just circularly shifted by one. How can I fix this?\n\nHere is the relevant part of my code:\n\n```python\nfig=plt.figure(figsize=(15, 6),facecolor='w', edgecolor='k')\nfor i in range(10):\n\n    #this part is just arranging the data for contourf \n    ind2 = py.find(zz==i+1)\n    sfr_mass_mat = np.reshape(sfr_mass[ind2],(pixmax_x,pixmax_y))\n    sfr_mass_sub = sfr_mass[ind2]\n    zi = griddata(massloclist, sfrloclist, sfr_mass_sub,xi,yi,interp='nn')\n\n    temp = 250+i  # this is to index the position of the subplot\n    ax=plt.subplot(temp)\n    ax.contourf(xi,yi,zi,5,cmap=plt.cm.Oranges)\n    plt.subplots_adjust(hspace = .5,wspace=.001)\n\n    #just annotating where each contour plot is being placed\n    ax.set_title(str(temp))\n```\n\nThe resulting layout of the 2 x 5 panels is:\n\n```\n251 - 252 - 253 - 254 - 255\n256 - 257 - 258 - 259 - 250\n```\n\nBut what I want is:\n\n```\n250 - 251 - 252 - 253 - 254\n255 - 256 - 257 - 258 - 259 \n```\n\nI would appreciate any help to resolve this issue."

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to how subplot indexing works in Python's `matplotlib`, which is slightly different from MATLAB. In MATLAB, subplot indices start from 1, while in Python, they also start from 1 but are calculated differently when using a single integer as the subplot position. The calculation for a subplot position in Python is done by considering a grid layout as a single continuous sequence.\n\nIn your code, you are using a single integer `temp` to specify the subplot position, which is then interpreted as a specific row and column in a grid. This interpretation can lead to confusion if not used correctly.\n\nHere's how you can fix it:\n\n1. Switch from using a single integer `temp` to specifying the row and column of the subplot directly with `plt.subplot(nrows, ncols, index)`, where `index` represents the position in a 1-based index format.\n\n2. Adjust your loop to correctly handle the subplot positions.\n\nHere is a modified version of your code with these changes:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.interpolate import griddata\n\n# Assuming that the data arrays and grid variables are defined elsewhere\n\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 5, figsize=(15, 6), facecolor='w', edgecolor='k')\naxes = axes.flatten()  # Flatten the 2D array of axes to 1D for easy iteration\n\nfor i in range(10):\n    # Arrange the data for contourf\n    ind2 = np.where(zz == i + 1)\n    sfr_mass_mat = np.reshape(sfr_mass[ind2], (pixmax_x, pixmax_y))\n    sfr_mass_sub = sfr_mass[ind2]\n    zi = griddata(massloclist, sfrloclist, sfr_mass_sub, xi, yi, method='nearest')\n\n    # Use the flattened axes array to access subplots\n    ax = axes[i]\n    ax.contourf(xi, yi, zi, 5, cmap=plt.cm.Oranges)\n    ax.set_title(str(250 + i))\n\n# Adjust spacing\nplt.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.5, wspace=0.001)\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n- **Using `plt.subplots()`**: This creates a grid of subplots and returns the axes in a structured form. You can then flatten this into a 1D array for easy iteration.\n- **Flattening the axes array**: This makes it easier to iterate over the subplot indices in the order you expect.\n- **Accessing subplots through the axes array**: By directly using the flattened `axes` array, you avoid issues with manual index calculations and ensure your plots are placed correctly.\n\nThese changes should correct the placement of your subplots to match your desired layout."
