Currently, I am using the following method that I created, but it feels like something that shouldn't have to be done manually:\n\n```python\ndef add_obj(obj, add_obj):\n    for property in add_obj:\n        obj[property] = add_obj[property]\n```\nHere, by \"object\", I am referring to a dictionary: `obj = {}`."

        "content": "Certainly! Python provides several ways to merge dictionaries efficiently, especially in recent versions. Here are some of the most common methods:\n\n### Using the `update()` Method\nThe `update()` method is built into dictionaries and allows you to update a dictionary with another dictionary's key-value pairs.\n\n```python\nobj1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\nobj2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n\nobj1.update(obj2)\nprint(obj1)\n# Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n```\n\n### Using the `{**d1, **d2}` Syntax (Python 3.5+)\nThis syntax allows you to create a new dictionary by unpacking the contents of the existing ones.\n\n```python\nobj1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\nobj2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n\nmerged_obj = {**obj1, **obj2}\nprint(merged_obj)\n# Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n```\n\n### Using the `|` Operator (Python 3.9+)\nPython 3.9 introduced the `|` operator for merging dictionaries, which is quite intuitive.\n\n```python\nobj1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\nobj2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n\nmerged_obj = obj1 | obj2\nprint(merged_obj)\n# Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n```\n\n### Using `collections.ChainMap` (for view, not actual merge)\nIf you want a view that combines multiple dictionaries, you can use `ChainMap` from the `collections` module.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import ChainMap\n\nobj1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\nobj2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}\n\ncombined = ChainMap(obj1, obj2)\nprint(dict(combined))\n# Output: {'b': 2, 'c': 4, 'a': 1}\n```\n\nChoose the method that best suits your Python version and needs. The `|` operator is great if you're using Python 3.9 or newer, while the `update()` method and unpacking syntax are excellent for older versions."
