For example, I have a string such as \"000000000000484240FA063DE5D0B744ADBED63A81FAEA390000C8428640A43D5005BD44\", but it can be much longer, sometimes several kilobytes. Is there a built-in way to perform this conversion in Python?"

        "content": "Yes, you can convert a long hexadecimal string into a bytes object in both Python 2.6 and Python 3 using built-in functions. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Python 3\n\nIn Python 3, you can use the `bytes.fromhex()` method, which is specifically designed for this purpose. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nhex_string = \"000000000000484240FA063DE5D0B744ADBED63A81FAEA390000C8428640A43D5005BD44\"\nbytes_object = bytes.fromhex(hex_string)\nprint(bytes_object)\n```\n\n### Python 2.6\n\nIn Python 2.6, the `bytes.fromhex()` method is not available, but you can achieve the same result using the `binascii` module. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport binascii\n\nhex_string = \"000000000000484240FA063DE5D0B744ADBED63A81FAEA390000C8428640A43D5005BD44\"\nbytes_object = binascii.unhexlify(hex_string)\nprint(bytes_object)\n```\n\nBoth methods will convert your hexadecimal string into a bytes object. Note that in Python 2, the result will be of type `str`, which is the closest equivalent to `bytes` in Python 3."
