I do not understand what this message means. Does it imply that my default package manager channels are being changed? Can this be reversed if I proceed with the installation? Is there any way to install the package without changing the default channel? Should I be favoring the superceding channels? I am concerned about changing my distribution for just one module, and potentially causing further issues. I found a related question here: https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/2898, but I am still unsure of what to do. I am using anaconda version: 4.2.13 and Python 2.7.12. \n\nI searched for the fuzzywuzzy package on anaconda by writing:\n```anaconda search -t fuzzywuzzy```\nThe most up-to-date version available for anaconda on 64 bit Linux is 0.13, provided on the channel `conda-forge`.\n\nI tried to install it by typing:\n```conda install -c conda-forge fuzzywuzzy=0.13.0```\nAnd received the following output:\n```The following packages will be downloaded:\n\npackage                    |            build\n---------------------------|-----------------\nconda-env-2.6.0            |                0         1017 B  conda-forge\npython-levenshtein-0.12.0  |           py27_0         138 KB  conda-forge\nconda-4.2.13               |           py27_0         375 KB  conda-forge\nfuzzywuzzy-0.11.0          |           py27_0          15 KB  conda-forge\n------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   Total:         528 KB\n\n\nThe following new packages will be INSTALLED:\n\n    fuzzywuzzy:            0.11.0-py27_0 conda-forge\n    python-levenshtein:    0.12.0-py27_0 conda-forge\n\nThe following packages will be SUPERCEDED by a higher-priority channel:\n\n    conda:        4.2.13-py27_0      --&gt; 4.2.13-py27_0 conda-forge \n    conda-env:    2.6.0-0            --&gt; 2.6.0-0       conda-forge \n\nProceed ([y]/n)?```"

        "content": "The message \"the following packages will be superseded by a higher priority channel\" means that some packages which are already installed in your environment will be replaced with versions from a different channel that has a higher priority. In this case, the packages `conda` and `conda-env` will be replaced by versions from the `conda-forge` channel.\n\n1. **Channel Priority**: Conda uses channels to distribute packages, and these channels can have priorities. When you specify a channel, such as `conda-forge`, it may have higher priority than the default channels, and thus, packages from this channel are preferred even if they are available in the default channel.\n\n2. **Does it imply a change in default channel?**: No, it does not change your default channels permanently. It just takes precedence for this particular installation process. Your default channels remain the same unless you explicitly change them in your configuration.\n\n3. **Reversibility**: Yes, you can reverse this by reinstalling the packages from the original channel. You can specify the channel explicitly or remove the `conda-forge` channel from your configuration if you added it.\n\n4. **Installing without changing the channel**: If you want to install the package without using the `conda-forge` channel, you'll need to find an equivalent version available in your default channel. However, it seems like the version you need is only available in `conda-forge`.\n\n5. **Should you favor the superseding channels?**: It depends on your use case. `conda-forge` is a very reputable community-driven channel that often has more up-to-date packages than the default Anaconda channel. If you are concerned about compatibility or stability, you might want to test in a separate environment first.\n\n6. **Concern about distribution changes**: If you proceed, the changes will affect only the current environment. If you are worried about potential issues, you can create a new conda environment specifically for this package to isolate changes:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda create -n fuzzywuzzy-env -c conda-forge fuzzywuzzy=0.13.0\n   conda activate fuzzywuzzy-env\n   ```\n\nThis way, your main environment remains unaffected, and you can test the package in isolation."
