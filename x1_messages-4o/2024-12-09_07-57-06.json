Specifically, I want to achieve the same functionality as the cv::clone() function in C++. Here is the code that I am using to get a rectangle from the image:\n\n```python\n    rectImg = img[10:20, 10:20]\n```\n\nHowever, I have noticed a strange behavior - when I draw a line on the rectangle image (rectImg), the line appears on both the original image (img) and the rectangle image (rectImg). How can I clone an image in cv2 Python without this happening?"

        "content": "In OpenCV with Python, slicing an image like `rectImg = img[10:20, 10:20]` creates a view of the original image, not a deep copy. This means any modifications to `rectImg` will affect the original `img` because they share the same underlying data. To achieve the same functionality as `cv::clone()` from C++, you need to create a deep copy of the image slice. You can do this using the `copy()` method in NumPy. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\n# Create a deep copy of the rectangle image\nrectImg = img[10:20, 10:20].copy()\n```\n\nBy using `copy()`, you ensure that `rectImg` is a separate copy of the specified region, and any modifications to it will not affect the original `img`. You can now safely draw on `rectImg` without changing the original image."
