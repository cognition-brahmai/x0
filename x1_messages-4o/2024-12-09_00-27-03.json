I have a model named 'Question' and I am able to query it using the following code:\n\n```python\nclass Question(Base):\n    __tablename__ = \"questions\"\n    id=Column(...)\n    user_id=Column(...)\n    ...\n\n# Querying the model\nquestion = Session.query(Question).filter_by(user_id=123).one()\n```\n\nBut I also have a table (not a model) called 'questions'. The table is defined as follows:\n\n```python\nquestions = Table('questions', Base.metadata,\n                  Column(id, ...),\n                  Column(user_id, ...),\n                  ....)\n```\n\nWhen I try to query it like I do with the model:\n\n```python\nSession.query(questions).filter_by(user_id=123).one()\n```\n\nI am getting an error:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"<console>\", line 1, in <module>\nFile \"E:\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\sqlalchemy-0.6.3-py2.7.egg\\sqlalchemy\\orm\\query.py\", line 851, in filter_by\n  for key, value in kwargs.iteritems()]\nFile \"E:\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\sqlalchemy-0.6.3-py2.7.egg\\sqlalchemy\\orm\\util.py\", line 567, in _entity_descriptor\n    desc = entity.class_manager[key]\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'class_manager'\n```\n\nHowever, when I try to query all records using `Session.query(questions).all()`, it works. Is `filter_by` only for models? If so, how can I query on tables?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering arises from the fact that `filter_by` is specifically designed for use with ORM models, not with tables defined using the `Table` construct. When using a `Table` object, you need to use SQLAlchemy's expression language to construct your queries.\n\nHere's how you can query a table using SQLAlchemy's expression language:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import select\n\n# Create a select statement for the table\nstmt = select([questions]).where(questions.c.user_id == 123)\n\n# Execute the query\nresult = Session.execute(stmt)\n\n# Fetch one result\nquestion = result.fetchone()\n```\n\nHere, `questions.c.user_id` accesses the `user_id` column of the `questions` table, and `select` constructs a query. The `Session.execute(stmt)` method executes the query and returns a result proxy, from which you can fetch records.\n\nThis approach is suitable when you are working directly with tables rather than using ORM models. If you prefer using ORM-like querying capabilities, you might want to consider defining a model for your table, similar to the `Question` model you already have."
