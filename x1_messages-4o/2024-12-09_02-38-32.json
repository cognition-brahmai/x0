        "content": "You can use Python to retrieve the title of a webpage by using libraries such as `requests` to fetch the webpage content and `BeautifulSoup` from the `bs4` package to parse the HTML and extract the title. Here's a simple example of how you can do this:\n\n1. First, you'll need to install the necessary libraries if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\npip install requests beautifulsoup4\n```\n\n2. Then, you can use the following code to retrieve the title of a webpage:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n# Specify the URL of the webpage\nurl = 'https://example.com'\n\n# Send a GET request to the webpage\nresponse = requests.get(url)\n\n# Check if the request was successful\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    # Parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')\n    \n    # Find the title tag and extract its content\n    title = soup.title.string if soup.title else 'No title found'\n    \n    # Print the title\n    print(f\"The title of the webpage is: {title}\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Failed to retrieve the webpage. Status code: {response.status_code}\")\n```\n\nReplace `'https://example.com'` with the URL of the webpage you want to retrieve the title from. The code sends a GET request to the specified URL, parses the HTML content, and extracts the text within the `<title>` tag. If the request is successful and the title tag is found, it prints the title; otherwise, it handles potential errors."
