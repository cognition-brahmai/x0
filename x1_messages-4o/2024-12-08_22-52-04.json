The binary representation of 1 is simply `1`.\n\n### Fractional Part:\nThe fractional part is 0.168. To convert this into binary, we can use the method of multiplying by 2 and recording the integer part.\n\n1. \\( 0.168 \\times 2 = 0.336 \\) \u2192 Integer part = 0\n2. \\( 0.336 \\times 2 = 0.672 \\) \u2192 Integer part = 0\n3. \\( 0.672 \\times 2 = 1.344 \\) \u2192 Integer part = 1\n4. \\( 0.344 \\times 2 = 0.688 \\) \u2192 Integer part = 0\n5. \\( 0.688 \\times 2 = 1.376 \\) \u2192 Integer part = 1\n6. \\( 0.376 \\times 2 = 0.752 \\) \u2192 Integer part = 0\n7. \\( 0.752 \\times 2 = 1.504 \\) \u2192 Integer part = 1\n8. \\( 0.504 \\times 2 = 1.008 \\) \u2192 Integer part = 1\n9. \\( 0.008 \\times 2 = 0.016 \\) \u2192 Integer part = 0\n10. \\( 0.016 \\times 2 = 0.032 \\) \u2192 Integer part = 0\n\nWe can stop here for a reasonable approximation. The fractional part in binary is approximately `0.0010111011`.\n\n### Combined:\nCombining both parts, the binary representation of 1.168 is approximately:\n\n\\[ 1.0010111011_2 \\]\n\nNote that the binary representation of the fractional part is an approximation, as some decimal fractions can't be represented exactly in binary."
