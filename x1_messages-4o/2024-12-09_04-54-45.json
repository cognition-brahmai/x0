I was hoping to use a function similar to `numpy.range`, but it appears that such a function does not exist. Can this be done through a loop? I'm looking for functionality similar to `numpy.mean` where, when the axis parameter is set to 1, it returns the mean for each row in the N-dimensional array."

        "content": "Certainly! While NumPy doesn't have a direct `numpy.range` function, you can calculate the range of each row by subtracting the minimum value of each row from the maximum value. You can achieve this using NumPy's `max` and `min` functions along with specifying the axis. Here's how you can do it without explicitly using a loop:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Assuming 'a' is your NumPy array of shape (94, 155)\na = np.array([\n    [1, 2, 20, 68, 210, 290],\n    [2, 33, 34, 55, 230, 340],\n    # ... other rows ...\n])\n\n# Calculate the range for each row\nrow_ranges = np.max(a, axis=1) - np.min(a, axis=1)\n\n# Output the ranges\nprint(row_ranges)\n```\n\nThis code will give you an array of length 94, where each element is the range (max - min) of the corresponding row in your original array. The `axis=1` parameter tells NumPy to perform the operation across each row."
