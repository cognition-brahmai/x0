For demonstration purposes, let's consider a polynomial equation of the form \\( f(x, y) = 3x^2 + 2xy + y^2 + 5x + 4y + 6 \\).\n\n```python\ndef evaluate_polynomial(x, y):\n    # Define the polynomial equation: f(x, y) = 3x^2 + 2xy + y^2 + 5x + 4y + 6\n    result = 3 * x**2 + 2 * x * y + y**2 + 5 * x + 4 * y + 6\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nx_value = 2\ny_value = 3\nresult = evaluate_polynomial(x_value, y_value)\nprint(f\"The result of the polynomial evaluation is: {result}\")\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `evaluate_polynomial` that takes `x` and `y` as inputs and calculates the value of the polynomial at those points. You can modify the polynomial equation inside the function to evaluate different polynomials."
