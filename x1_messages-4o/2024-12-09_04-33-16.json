For example, given a list of tuples like this:\n\n```python\n[(1, u'abc'), (2, u'def')]\n```\nI would like to create a list that only contains the first elements of each tuple, like so:\n\n```python\n[1,2]\n```\nThis list will be used in an `__in` operation, so it needs to be a list of integer values."
