        "content": "Certainly! Below is a Python script that demonstrates the use of an `if-else` statement for the described conditions, along with a nested `if` statement to check if the current month is June, July, or August.\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\n# Example temperature and humidity values\ntemperature = 85  # in degrees Fahrenheit\nhumidity = 75     # in percentage\n\n# Get the current month\ncurrent_month = datetime.datetime.now().month\n\n# Check the conditions\nif temperature > 80 and humidity > 70:\n    print(\"It's hot and humid!\")\n    \n    # Nested if to check if the current month is June, July, or August\n    if current_month in [6, 7, 8]:\n        print(\"It's summer time!\")\nelif temperature < 60 and humidity < 50:\n    print(\"It's cool and dry!\")\n    \n    # Nested if to check if the current month is June, July, or August\n    if current_month in [6, 7, 8]:\n        print(\"Unusually cool for summer!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Weather conditions are moderate.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The script first imports the `datetime` module to get the current month.\n- It then checks if the temperature is above 80\u00b0F and the humidity is above 70%. If true, it prints a message and checks if the current month is June, July, or August (months 6, 7, and 8) to print an additional message.\n- If the above condition is false, it checks if the temperature is below 60\u00b0F and the humidity is below 50%. If this condition is true, it prints another message and checks again for the summer months to print an additional message.\n- If neither of the conditions are met, it prints a message indicating moderate weather conditions."
