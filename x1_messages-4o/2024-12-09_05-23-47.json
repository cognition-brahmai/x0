I am currently using the unittest framework in Python and executing test cases like this:\n\n```python\nsuite = unittest.TestLoader().loadTestsFromTestCase(MyAwesomeTest)\nunittest.TextTestRunner(verbosity=2).run(suite)\n```\n\nI've noticed that the number 2 is frequently passed as the verbosity parameter. Can you explain what this number represents and what other values can I pass to this parameter?"

        "content": "In the context of Python's `unittest` framework, the `verbosity` parameter controls the level of detail provided in the test output when you run your test suite using `TextTestRunner`.\n\nHere's what the different verbosity levels typically mean:\n\n- **verbosity=0**: This is the minimal level of verbosity. The test runner will only output a single character for each test: a dot (.) for a passing test, an 'F' for a failing test, and an 'E' for an error. This is useful if you want a very concise output.\n\n- **verbosity=1**: This is the default level of verbosity if you do not specify any verbosity parameter. It provides a bit more detail than verbosity=0 by printing a single line per test, showing the test method name and its result (e.g., \"test_method_name ... ok\" or \"test_method_name ... FAIL\").\n\n- **verbosity=2**: This level provides a more detailed output, which includes the name of each test along with its output and result. It is more verbose and useful for understanding which specific tests are being run and their outcomes, especially in larger test suites.\n\nChoosing the verbosity level depends on how much information you want to see in the output when you run your tests. Higher verbosity levels can be particularly helpful when diagnosing test failures or when you want more insight into which tests are being executed."
