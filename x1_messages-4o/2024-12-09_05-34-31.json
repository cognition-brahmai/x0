Additionally, make sure there isn't a space between the variable name and the assignment operator. Here's how you can modify your script to correctly perform the addition at line 16:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nnum=0\nmetab=0\n\nfor ((i=1; i<=2; i++)); do\n    for j in `ls output-$i-*`; do\n        echo \"$j\"\n\n        metab=$(cat $j | grep EndBuffer | awk '{sum+=$2} END { print sum/120}')  # line 15\n        num=$((num + metab))  # line 16\n    done\n    echo \"$num\"\ndone\n```\n\nIn line 16, I replaced `num= $num + $metab` with `num=$((num + metab))`. This uses the arithmetic expansion syntax `(( ))` to perform the addition. Make sure there is no space between `num=` and `$((num + metab))`. This ensures that `num` is updated correctly with the result of the addition."
