        "content": "Writing a JavaScript program to print \"Hello World\" on the console is quite simple. You just need to use the `console.log()` function, which outputs messages to the web console. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on how you can do it:\n\n1. **Open a Text Editor**: Use any text editor like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, or even Notepad.\n\n2. **Write the JavaScript Code**: Enter the following code in your text editor:\n\n   ```javascript\n   console.log(\"Hello World\");\n   ```\n\n3. **Save the File**: Save the file with a `.js` extension, for example `helloWorld.js`.\n\n4. **Run the JavaScript Code**: \n   - If you have Node.js installed on your computer, you can run this script using the command line. Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your file is saved, and type:\n     ```\n     node helloWorld.js\n     ```\n   - If you want to run it in a browser, you can open the browser's developer tools (usually by pressing `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`), go to the \"Console\" tab, and paste your JavaScript code there. It will execute immediately.\n\nBy following these steps, you should see \"Hello World\" printed in the console. This is a basic way to output messages in JavaScript and is often the starting point for learning the language."
