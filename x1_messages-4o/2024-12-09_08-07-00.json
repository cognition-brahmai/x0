Based on this, I believe Python was installed correctly. However, when I am trying to type `conda list` and `conda --version` in command prompt, I receive this error message: `conda is not recognized as an internal or external command.` To resolve this, I have set the environment variable for Anaconda3 with `Variable Name: Path` and `Variable Value: C:\\Users\\dipanwita.neogy\\Anaconda3`. Despite this, I am still encountering the problem. How can I fix this issue?"

        "content": "It sounds like the issue is related to the system's PATH environment variable not being set correctly. Here\u2019s how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify the Anaconda Installation Path**:\n   Ensure that `C:\\Users\\dipanwita.neogy\\Anaconda3\\Scripts` is the correct path where Anaconda is installed. The `conda` command is located in the `Scripts` directory, so this path needs to be included in your PATH environment variable.\n\n2. **Update the PATH Environment Variable**:\n   You may need to add the `Scripts` directory to your PATH variable. Follow these steps:\n\n   - Right-click on 'Computer' or 'This PC' on the desktop or in File Explorer and select 'Properties'.\n   - Click on 'Advanced system settings'.\n   - Click on the 'Environment Variables' button.\n   - In the 'System variables' section, find the `Path` variable and select it, then click 'Edit'.\n   - Add the following paths to the end of the `Variable value` box, separated by semicolons:\n     ```\n     C:\\Users\\dipanwita.neogy\\Anaconda3\n     C:\\Users\\dipanwita.neogy\\Anaconda3\\Scripts\n     C:\\Users\\dipanwita.neogy\\Anaconda3\\Library\\bin\n     ```\n   - Click 'OK' to close all dialogs.\n\n3. **Restart Command Prompt**:\n   After making changes to the PATH variable, you must restart any open command prompt windows for the changes to take effect.\n\n4. **Verify Installation**:\n   Open a new command prompt window and type `conda --version` to check if the command is recognized now.\n\n5. **Check for Typos**:\n   Ensure there are no typos in the path and that the paths are correctly set as described.\n\n6. **Check for Other Issues**:\n   If the issue persists, ensure that there is no other software that might interfere with the PATH settings, such as another Python distribution or any software that modifies the PATH variable.\n\nAfter following these steps, the `conda` command should be recognized in the command prompt. If you still encounter problems, consider reinstalling Anaconda and ensuring that the option to add Anaconda to the PATH is selected during installation."
