Here's a function to achieve that:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef parse_datetime(date_string):\n    # Define the format with and without microseconds\n    format_with_microseconds = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f'\n    format_without_microseconds = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'\n    \n    try:\n        # Try parsing with microseconds\n        return datetime.strptime(date_string, format_with_microseconds)\n    except ValueError:\n        # If it fails, parse without microseconds and set them to 0\n        return datetime.strptime(date_string, format_without_microseconds)\n\n# Example usage\ndate_str_with_microseconds = '2023-10-31 14:23:45.123456'\ndate_str_without_microseconds = '2023-10-31 14:23:45'\n\n# Parsing\ndt_with_microseconds = parse_datetime(date_str_with_microseconds)\ndt_without_microseconds = parse_datetime(date_str_without_microseconds)\n\nprint(\"With microseconds:\", dt_with_microseconds)\nprint(\"Without microseconds:\", dt_without_microseconds)\n```\n\nThis code attempts to parse the datetime string with microseconds first. If a `ValueError` is raised (indicating the format didn't match), it attempts to parse without microseconds, setting them to zero by default. This approach handles both cases effectively."
