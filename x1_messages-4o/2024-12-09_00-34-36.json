        "content": "The error you're encountering, `IOError: [Errno 24] Too many open files`, indicates that you're attempting to open more files simultaneously than your operating system allows, despite adjusting the limits. Even though you've increased the limit, opening all files at once might still exceed the maximum number of file descriptors available to your process.\n\nHere are some strategies to mitigate this issue:\n\n1. **Open Files as Needed**:\n   Instead of opening all files at once, open them as needed, process the data, and close them immediately. This approach will ensure that you don't exceed the maximum file descriptor limit.\n\n2. **Use Context Managers**:\n   Utilize Python's `with` statement to manage file opening and closing, which ensures files are closed promptly after their use, thus freeing up file descriptors.\n\n3. **Batch Processing**:\n   You can split the file processing task into smaller batches. Open a subset of files, process them, and then close them before opening the next batch.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement these strategies:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Assuming `pureResponseNames` is your list of filenames\nbatch_size = 100  # Adjust the batch size based on your system's capabilities\n\n# Iterate over the filenames in batches\nfor i in range(0, len(pureResponseNames), batch_size):\n    # Get the current batch\n    batch = pureResponseNames[i:i + batch_size]\n    \n    # Process the current batch\n    for fname in batch:\n        file_path = os.path.join(outpathDirTest, fname) + \".txt\"\n        with open(file_path, \"w\") as f:\n            # Write to the file, e.g., f.write(data)\n            pass  # Replace with actual file writing logic\n\n    # At this point, all files in the current batch are closed\n\n# Continue with further processing if needed\n```\n\nThis code processes files in batches of 100 (you can adjust this number based on your system's file descriptor limits). It uses the `with` statement to ensure files are closed immediately after writing, which helps manage the number of open files at any given time."
