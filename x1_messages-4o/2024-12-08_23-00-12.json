        "content": "The earliest recorded methods of advanced mathematical calculations are often attributed to ancient civilizations such as the Babylonians, Egyptians, and Chinese. These civilizations developed mathematical systems that laid the groundwork for future advancements.\n\n1. **Babylonians**: The Babylonians, who lived in Mesopotamia around 1800 BCE, are known for their base-60 (sexagesimal) numeral system. They used this system for complex calculations in astronomy, geometry, and commerce. The Babylonians created clay tablets that contained tables for multiplication, division, and even quadratic equations, which they used to solve practical problems such as land measurement and trade.\n\n2. **Egyptians**: The ancient Egyptians, around 2000 BCE, developed a base-10 numeral system and utilized hieroglyphs for numbers. They performed calculations using a method called \"Egyptian multiplication,\" which involved doubling numbers and adding them together to achieve the desired result. They applied their mathematical knowledge primarily in architecture and engineering, particularly in constructing their monumental structures like pyramids and temples.\n\n3. **Chinese**: The ancient Chinese, around the 1st millennium BCE, used a decimal system and developed early forms of algebra and geometry. They recorded their calculations on bamboo strips and were known for solving systems of equations, which they applied in various fields, including astronomy and surveying.\n\nThese civilizations laid the foundation for modern mathematics by developing methods to solve practical problems, which later influenced Greek and Islamic mathematicians. Their contributions include the development of number systems, algebraic techniques, and geometric principles that are still in use today."
