        "content": "Certainly! Below is a simple C# program that takes two numbers as input from the user and then adds them together:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        // Prompt the user to enter the first number\n        Console.Write(\"Enter the first number: \");\n        double number1 = Convert.ToDouble(Console.ReadLine());\n\n        // Prompt the user to enter the second number\n        Console.Write(\"Enter the second number: \");\n        double number2 = Convert.ToDouble(Console.ReadLine());\n\n        // Add the two numbers\n        double sum = number1 + number2;\n\n        // Display the result\n        Console.WriteLine(\"The sum of {0} and {1} is {2}.\", number1, number2, sum);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### How it works:\n1. The program prompts the user to input the first number.\n2. The input is read from the console and converted to a double data type.\n3. The same process is repeated for the second number.\n4. The two numbers are then added together.\n5. Finally, the result is printed to the console.\n\nYou can run this program in any C# compatible environment, such as Visual Studio or an online C# compiler."
