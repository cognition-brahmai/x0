Here's a general example assuming you have a table named `users` and a column named `email`:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM users\nWHERE email LIKE '%example.com%';\n```\n\nThis query selects all columns from the `users` table where the `email` column contains the substring \"example.com\". The `%` symbols are wildcards that allow for any sequence of characters before and after \"example.com\"."
