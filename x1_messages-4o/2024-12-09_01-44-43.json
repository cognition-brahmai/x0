To illustrate, in order to highlight 'js', I use the following code: \n```js\nfunction () { return \"This code is highlighted as Javascript!\"}\n```\nSimilarly, to highlight HTML code, I use ```html. I am looking for a similar way to highlight Bash or shell commands. Could someone provide guidance on this?"

This tells the Markdown renderer to apply syntax highlighting appropriate for shell scripts. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# This is a comment in Bash\necho \"Hello, World!\"\n```\n\nOr you can use `sh`:\n\n```sh\n#!/bin/sh\n# This is a comment in a shell script\necho \"Hello, World!\"\n```\n\nBoth `bash` and `sh` will provide syntax highlighting for shell commands in Markdown files, depending on the Markdown processor you are using."
