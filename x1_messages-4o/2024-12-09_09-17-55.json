        "content": "Implementing a memory allocator using the Buddy System algorithm in Python is an interesting exercise. The Buddy System is a memory allocation algorithm that manages memory in powers of two, allowing for efficient splitting and coalescing of memory blocks. Here's a simple implementation to get you started:\n\n```python\nclass BuddyAllocator:\n    def __init__(self, size):\n        # Initialize the allocator with a total size of memory\n        self.total_size = size\n        self.free_lists = self._initialize_free_lists(size)\n\n    def _initialize_free_lists(self, size):\n        # Create free lists for each power of two up to the total size\n        free_lists = {}\n        current_size = 1\n        while current_size <= size:\n            free_lists[current_size] = []\n            current_size *= 2\n        # Add the entire memory as a single free block\n        free_lists[size].append(0)\n        return free_lists\n\n    def _find_suitable_block(self, size):\n        # Find the smallest block that can accommodate the requested size\n        current_size = size\n        while current_size <= self.total_size:\n            if self.free_lists[current_size]:\n                return current_size\n            current_size *= 2\n        return None\n\n    def allocate(self, size):\n        # Round up the requested size to the next power of two\n        rounded_size = 1\n        while rounded_size < size:\n            rounded_size *= 2\n\n        # Find a suitable block using the free lists\n        block_size = self._find_suitable_block(rounded_size)\n        if block_size is None:\n            raise MemoryError(\"Insufficient memory to allocate.\")\n\n        # Split bigger blocks if necessary\n        while block_size != rounded_size:\n            block_address = self.free_lists[block_size].pop(0)\n            block_size //= 2\n            self.free_lists[block_size].append(block_address + block_size)\n            self.free_lists[block_size].append(block_address)\n\n        # Allocate the block by removing it from the free list\n        block_address = self.free_lists[rounded_size].pop(0)\n        return block_address\n\n    def deallocate(self, address, size):\n        # Round up the size to the next power of two\n        rounded_size = 1\n        while rounded_size < size:\n            rounded_size *= 2\n\n        # Add the block back to the free list\n        self.free_lists[rounded_size].append(address)\n\n        # Attempt to coalesce the block with its buddy\n        self._coalesce(address, rounded_size)\n\n    def _coalesce(self, address, size):\n        buddy_address = address ^ size\n        if buddy_address in self.free_lists[size]:\n            self.free_lists[size].remove(buddy_address)\n            new_address = min(address, buddy_address)\n            new_size = size * 2\n            self.free_lists[new_size].append(new_address)\n            self._coalesce(new_address, new_size)\n\n\n# Example usage\nallocator = BuddyAllocator(64)  # Initialize with 64 units of memory\n\n# Allocate memory blocks\naddr1 = allocator.allocate(10)\nprint(f\"Allocated at address: {addr1}\")\n\naddr2 = allocator.allocate(20)\nprint(f\"Allocated at address: {addr2}\")\n\n# Deallocate a memory block\nallocator.deallocate(addr1, 10)\nprint(f\"Deallocated address: {addr1}\")\n\n# Allocate another block\naddr3 = allocator.allocate(15)\nprint(f\"Allocated at address: {addr3}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The `BuddyAllocator` class initializes with a given `size` and prepares free lists for each power of two up to the total size.\n\n2. **Allocation**: The `allocate` method rounds the requested size up to the next power of two and finds a suitable block. If a larger block is found, it splits it until it matches the requested size.\n\n3. **Deallocation**: The `deallocate` method adds the block back to the free list and attempts to coalesce it with its buddy block. The buddy is found using the XOR operation on the address and size.\n\n4. **Coalescing**: The `_coalesce` method checks if a block's buddy is free and, if so, merges them into a larger block.\n\nThis implementation is simplified for educational purposes and assumes memory sizes are powers of two. In a real-world scenario, you'd need additional features like boundary checks, handling non-power-of-two memory sizes, and more sophisticated error handling."
