For the square and rectangle, the user should input the length and width. For the circle, the user should input the radius. For the triangle, the user should input the length of each side. The program should then draw the selected shape using the Python turtle graphics module. Can you provide the code implementation for this program?"

        "content": "Certainly! Below is a Python program that uses the `turtle` module to draw basic shapes based on user input. The program allows the user to choose between a square, rectangle, circle, or triangle and prompts for the necessary dimensions to draw the selected shape.\n\n```python\nimport turtle\n\ndef draw_square(side_length):\n    for _ in range(4):\n        turtle.forward(side_length)\n        turtle.right(90)\n\ndef draw_rectangle(length, width):\n    for _ in range(2):\n        turtle.forward(length)\n        turtle.right(90)\n        turtle.forward(width)\n        turtle.right(90)\n\ndef draw_circle(radius):\n    turtle.circle(radius)\n\ndef draw_triangle(side1, side2, side3):\n    # Assume it's a simple triangle where all sides are given\n    # Using turtle to draw each side separately\n    # This implementation does not assume any specific type of triangle\n    for side in [side1, side2, side3]:\n        turtle.forward(side)\n        turtle.left(120)  # This is a simple approximation for an equilateral triangle\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Choose a shape to draw: \")\n    print(\"1. Square\")\n    print(\"2. Rectangle\")\n    print(\"3. Circle\")\n    print(\"4. Triangle\")\n\n    choice = input(\"Enter the number of your choice: \")\n\n    if choice == '1':\n        side_length = float(input(\"Enter the side length of the square: \"))\n        draw_square(side_length)\n    elif choice == '2':\n        length = float(input(\"Enter the length of the rectangle: \"))\n        width = float(input(\"Enter the width of the rectangle: \"))\n        draw_rectangle(length, width)\n    elif choice == '3':\n        radius = float(input(\"Enter the radius of the circle: \"))\n        draw_circle(radius)\n    elif choice == '4':\n        side1 = float(input(\"Enter the length of side 1 of the triangle: \"))\n        side2 = float(input(\"Enter the length of side 2 of the triangle: \"))\n        side3 = float(input(\"Enter the length of side 3 of the triangle: \"))\n        draw_triangle(side1, side2, side3)\n    else:\n        print(\"Invalid choice!\")\n\n    turtle.done()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Turtle Module**: This program uses Python's built-in `turtle` graphics library, which is great for drawing shapes.\n2. **Function Definitions**:\n   - `draw_square`: Draws a square given the side length.\n   - `draw_rectangle`: Draws a rectangle given the length and width.\n   - `draw_circle`: Draws a circle given the radius.\n   - `draw_triangle`: Draws a triangle given the lengths of its sides.\n3. **Main function**: Prompts the user for their choice of shape and collects the necessary dimensions to draw it.\n\n### Notes:\n- The triangle drawing function assumes a simple equilateral triangle; for more complex triangles, additional calculation for angles would be required.\n- To run this program, ensure you have a Python environment with the `turtle` module available. This should be available in standard Python installations."
