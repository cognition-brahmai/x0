        "content": "The error you're encountering typically arises when there's a mismatch between the device types of your model and your inputs. Your model's weights are on the GPU (`torch.cuda.FloatTensor`), but your inputs are still on the CPU (`torch.FloatTensor`). To resolve this issue, you need to move your inputs to the same device as your model. Here's a corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\ndevice = torch.device(\"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\nmodel.to(device)\n\nfor data in dataloader:\n    inputs, labels = data\n    inputs, labels = inputs.to(device), labels.to(device)  # Move inputs and labels to the device\n    outputs = model(inputs)\n```\n\nBy calling `inputs.to(device)` and `labels.to(device)`, you ensure that both the inputs and labels are transferred to the correct device (either GPU or CPU, depending on availability). This should resolve the `RuntimeError` you're encountering."
