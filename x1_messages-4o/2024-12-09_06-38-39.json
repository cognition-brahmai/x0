        "content": "To bulk indent a block of code in Emacs while working with Python, you can use the following steps. These steps should help you efficiently indent multiple lines at once, saving you time:\n\n1. **Select the Block of Code:**\n   - Place the cursor at the beginning of the block of code you want to indent.\n   - Press `C-SPC` (Control + Space) to set the mark.\n   - Move the cursor to the end of the block of code to select it.\n\n2. **Indent the Block:**\n   - Once you have the block selected, you can indent it by using the `indent-rigidly` command.\n   - Press `C-x` followed by `TAB` (or `C-x C-i`) to invoke the `indent-rigidly` command.\n   - You will be prompted to enter the number of columns to indent. You can enter a positive number to indent to the right or a negative number to indent to the left.\n\n3. **Alternatively, Use Python Mode Indentation:**\n   - If you're in Python mode, you can also use the `C-c >` command to increase the indentation of the selected block or `C-c <` to decrease it.\n   - These commands work by indenting or unindenting the region according to Python's indentation rules.\n\nBy using these techniques, you can quickly and efficiently adjust the indentation of a block of code in Emacs while working with Python."
