I'm trying to remove this extension from each entry, but my current method doesn't seem to work. Here is the code I've used so far:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv('fname.csv')\n\ndf.head()\n\nfilename    A    B    C\nfn1.txt   2    4    5\nfn2.txt   1    2    1\nfn3.txt   ....\n....\n\ndf['filename'] = df['filename'].map(lambda x: str(x)[:-4])\n```\n\nHowever, when I check the 'filename' column entries afterwards using `df.head()`, I see that the entries are unchanged. How can I successfully remove the '.txt' file extension from each entry in the 'filename' column?"

        "content": "Your approach using the `map` function with a lambda function is actually correct for removing the last four characters (i.e., the \".txt\" extension) from each entry in the 'filename' column. However, if the entries remain unchanged, it could be due to a couple of reasons:\n\n1. **Leading or trailing spaces**: If there are any leading or trailing spaces in the filename entries, these will affect the slicing. You should strip these spaces before attempting to remove the extension.\n\n2. **Data type issues**: Ensure that the 'filename' column is of string type.\n\nHere's an updated version of your code that addresses these potential issues:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read the CSV file\ndf = pd.read_csv('fname.csv')\n\n# Strip leading and trailing spaces, if any, and remove the '.txt' extension\ndf['filename'] = df['filename'].str.strip().str[:-4]\n\n# Display the first few entries to verify the changes\nprint(df.head())\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n\n- **`str.strip()`**: This method removes any leading or trailing whitespace characters from the strings in the 'filename' column.\n- **`str[:-4]`**: This slices off the last four characters from each string, which effectively removes the '.txt' extension.\n\nBy ensuring that any extraneous spaces are removed and that you are correctly slicing the strings, the '.txt' extension should be successfully removed from each entry."
