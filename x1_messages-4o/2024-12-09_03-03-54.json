As per my understanding, CRUD operations only invoke the four main methods in `viewsets.ModelViewSet`: `create()`, `retrieve()`, `update()`, and `destroy()`. Upon testing, I found that only the methods in `ModelViewSet` are invoked when I use HTTP verbs. However, I don't see any calls to the `create()` and `update()` methods in `ModelSerializer`. Can you clarify the function of these methods in `ModelSerializer`, as I see these methods are frequently overridden?"

        "content": "In Django REST framework, the `.create(self, validated_data)` and `.update(self, validated_data)` methods in a `ModelSerializer` are crucial for handling the creation and updating of instances from validated data. These methods are part of the serialization process and come into play within the flow of a `ModelViewSet`. Let me explain how they fit into the larger picture:\n\n1. **ModelViewSet and HTTP Verbs:**\n   - When you use HTTP verbs like POST or PUT with a `ModelViewSet`, the corresponding viewset methods (`create`, `update`) are called. These methods handle the request and prepare the data for serializer processing.\n\n2. **Serializer's Role:**\n   - Within these viewset methods, a serializer instance is created and populated with the incoming data. The data is then validated, and if everything is correct, the serializer's `.save()` method is called.\n\n3. **Create and Update Methods:**\n   - The `.save()` method in a `ModelSerializer` orchestrates the creation or updating of an instance. It determines whether `.create()` or `.update()` should be called based on whether the instance already exists.\n   - **`.create(self, validated_data)`**: This method is invoked when you are creating a new instance. It takes the `validated_data` and returns the newly created instance. You can override this method if you need custom logic during object creation, such as setting additional fields or handling related objects.\n   - **`.update(self, instance, validated_data)`**: This method is called when an existing instance is being updated. It takes both the existing `instance` and the `validated_data` and should return the updated instance. Overriding this method is useful when you need to apply custom update logic.\n\n4. **Why Override These Methods?**\n   - You might override `.create()` and `.update()` in scenarios where you need to perform actions that go beyond simple field assignments, such as handling nested relationships, setting default values, or triggering signals and hooks.\n\nIn summary, while the viewset methods handle the HTTP requests and responses, the serializer's `.create()` and `.update()` methods are responsible for the actual data manipulation and instance management. They provide a clear separation of concerns, allowing you to customize how data is turned into database records or how existing records are modified, without tangling these concerns with request handling logic."
