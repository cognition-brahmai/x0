Specifically, I want to display text describing items in a room, but only if the item object is in the room object's list of items. I am looking for a pythonic method for formatting strings based on the result of a Boolean conditional. I'm hoping to find something similar to a generator expression. For instance, I want to generate a string like this: \n\n```python\n\"At least, that's what %s told me.\" %(\"he\" if gender == \"male\", else: \"she\")\n```\nBut I am aware that the example above is not valid Python code. Is there any valid expression for boolean string formatting in Python?"

        "content": "In Python, you can achieve this kind of conditional string formatting using the ternary conditional operator, which is a concise way to perform an inline if-else condition. The syntax for the ternary operator is:\n\n```python\nvalue_if_true if condition else value_if_false\n```\n\nIn your case, you can use the ternary operator to select between \"he\" and \"she\" based on the value of the `gender` variable. Here's how you can format the string:\n\n```python\ngender = \"male\"  # or \"female\"\nformatted_string = \"At least, that's what %s told me.\" % (\"he\" if gender == \"male\" else \"she\")\nprint(formatted_string)\n```\n\nThis will correctly replace `%s` with \"he\" if `gender` is \"male\", or \"she\" if `gender` is not \"male\". The ternary operator provides a clean and Pythonic way to handle conditional logic in expressions."
