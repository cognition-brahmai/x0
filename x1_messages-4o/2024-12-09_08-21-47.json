Even though I have manually installed all of its dependencies, including VTK and its python wrapper, I am encountering an error that says \"ImportError: No module named vtk\". I have also tried using \"sudo pip install mayavi\" but it does not solve the problem. My PYTHONPATH is empty. Can anyone help me resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering often arises from Python not being able to locate the VTK module. Here are some steps you can follow to try to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify VTK Installation**:\n   - Ensure that VTK is properly installed and its Python bindings are available. You can do this by trying to import VTK directly in a Python shell:\n     ```python\n     import vtk\n     ```\n   - If this fails, you may need to reinstall VTK with Python bindings.\n\n2. **Set PYTHONPATH**:\n   - If VTK is installed but Python cannot find it, you may need to adjust your `PYTHONPATH`. Find where VTK is installed, and add its directory to your `PYTHONPATH`. You can do this by adding the following line to your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc` (depending on your shell):\n     ```bash\n     export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/vtk\n     ```\n   - Replace `/path/to/vtk` with the actual path to the VTK Python bindings.\n\n3. **Using Virtual Environments**:\n   - Consider using a virtual environment to manage your Python packages. This can help avoid conflicts between system-level packages and those needed for specific projects.\n   - You can create a virtual environment and install Mayavi and its dependencies within it:\n     ```bash\n     python -m venv myenv\n     source myenv/bin/activate\n     pip install mayavi\n     ```\n\n4. **Check Python Version Compatibility**:\n   - Ensure that the versions of Mayavi and VTK you are trying to install are compatible with Python 2.7.2. If possible, consider upgrading to a newer Python version, as Python 2.7 has reached end-of-life.\n\n5. **Reinstall VTK with Homebrew**:\n   - If you installed VTK manually, consider using Homebrew to manage its installation. Homebrew can simplify the installation process and ensure that dependencies are correctly set up:\n     ```bash\n     brew install vtk\n     ```\n\n6. **Install Mayavi from Source**:\n   - As a last resort, you could try installing Mayavi from source. This involves cloning the Mayavi repository and running the setup script.\n   - Follow the instructions on the [Mayavi GitHub page](https://github.com/enthought/mayavi) for installing from source.\n\nIf these steps do not resolve the issue, please provide additional details about the error messages or any other symptoms you encounter, as this may help in diagnosing the problem further."
