For instance, I want to be able to determine if the time '00:00' is in a reversed range such as ['23:00', '01:00']. I have previously written a PHP function to accomplish this, but I want to make a more elegant solution in Python."

        "content": "To check if the current time is within a certain range, even if the end time is less than the start time (such as \"23:00 - 06:00\"), you can use Python's `datetime` module. The key is to handle the \"reversed\" range by checking if the current time is either between the start and end of the same day or between the start and end spanning midnight. Here's a solution:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, time\n\ndef is_time_in_range(start_time_str, end_time_str, check_time=None):\n    # Convert string times to time objects\n    start_time = datetime.strptime(start_time_str, \"%H:%M\").time()\n    end_time = datetime.strptime(end_time_str, \"%H:%M\").time()\n    \n    # Use current time if check_time is not provided\n    if check_time is None:\n        check_time = datetime.now().time()\n    \n    # Check if the range crosses midnight\n    if start_time <= end_time:\n        # Normal case, start_time is before end_time\n        return start_time <= check_time <= end_time\n    else:\n        # Reversed range case, spans midnight\n        return check_time >= start_time or check_time <= end_time\n\n# Example usage\ncurrent_time = datetime.now().strftime(\"%H:%M\")\nprint(f\"Current time: {current_time}\")\n\n# Check if current time is in the reversed range '23:00' to '01:00'\nif is_time_in_range('23:00', '01:00'):\n    print(\"The current time is within the range.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The current time is outside the range.\")\n```\n\nThis function `is_time_in_range` allows you to specify a start and end time as strings. It checks if the current time (or a specified check time) falls within this range. It handles both normal and reversed time ranges effectively."
