Additionally, the width and height of the flyer should be consecutive Fibonacci numbers, and the sum of the digits of the dimensions should be a multiple of 3. Once you have determined the exact dimensions of the flyer, create a sample design that includes the event details, a compelling image, and a donation call-to-action. Ready to take on this rare challenge? Best of luck!"

        "content": "To tackle this challenge, let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Consecutive Fibonacci Numbers**: First, we need to identify consecutive Fibonacci numbers for the width and height of the flyer.\n\n2. **Prime Number Size**: The size of the flyer, which is the sum of the width and height, needs to be a prime number.\n\n3. **Perfect Square Area**: The area of the flyer (width \u00d7 height) must be a perfect square.\n\n4. **Sum of Digits is a Multiple of 3**: The sum of the digits of both the width and height should be a multiple of 3.\n\nLet's go through the Fibonacci sequence to find suitable numbers:\n\n- Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...\n\nLooking at consecutive Fibonacci numbers:\n\n- Width = 8, Height = 13\n  - Size = 8 + 13 = 21 (Not prime)\n  - Area = 8 \u00d7 13 = 104 (Not a perfect square)\n\n- Width = 13, Height = 21\n  - Size = 13 + 21 = 34 (Not prime)\n  - Area = 13 \u00d7 21 = 273 (Not a perfect square)\n\n- Width = 21, Height = 34\n  - Size = 21 + 34 = 55 (Not prime)\n  - Area = 21 \u00d7 34 = 714 (Not a perfect square)\n\n- Width = 34, Height = 55\n  - Size = 34 + 55 = 89 (Prime)\n  - Area = 34 \u00d7 55 = 1870 (Not a perfect square)\n\nAfter testing various combinations, let's try:\n\n- Width = 5, Height = 8\n  - Size = 5 + 8 = 13 (Prime)\n  - Area = 5 \u00d7 8 = 40 (Not a perfect square)\n\n- Width = 1, Height = 1\n  - Size = 1 + 1 = 2 (Prime)\n  - Area = 1 \u00d7 1 = 1 (Perfect square)\n\nThe only feasible solution is Width = 1 and Height = 1, which meets all conditions, but it seems impractical for a flyer size.\n\nSince no practical solution meets all criteria, let's focus on creating a sample design for an ideal flyer size:\n\n### Sample Flyer Design:\n\n**Charity Event: Helping Hands Gala**\n\n- **Date**: December 15, 2023\n- **Time**: 6:00 PM\n- **Venue**: Grand Auditorium, City Center\n- **Contact**: [Email/Phone Number]\n\n**Compelling Image**: [Include an image of people working together, symbolizing community and support.]\n\n**Donation Call-to-Action**: \n\n\"Join us in making a difference! Your contributions can change lives. Donate generously to support those in need. Every little bit helps!\"\n\n**Design Elements**:\n- Use a harmonious color scheme to evoke warmth and community spirit.\n- Highlight the event details in bold, easily readable fonts.\n- Ensure the call-to-action stands out with a contrasting color or design element.\n\nThis design approach will ensure the flyer communicates the essence of the charity event effectively, even if the mathematical challenge presented some limitations."
