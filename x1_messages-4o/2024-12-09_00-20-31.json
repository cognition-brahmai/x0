        "content": "I have two columns in a Pandas data frame that represent dates. I want to subtract one column from the other and get the result as the difference in number of days, represented as an integer. I have successfully created a new column with the difference, but I am unable to convert this result into a numeric format. How can I achieve this? \n\nBelow is a look at my data and the code I have used so far:\n\n```python\ndf_test.head(10)\nOut[20]: \n  First_Date Second Date\n0 2016-02-09  2015-11-19\n1 2016-01-06  2015-11-30\n2        NaT  2015-12-04\n3 2016-01-06  2015-12-08\n4        NaT  2015-12-09\n5 2016-01-07  2015-12-11\n6        NaT  2015-12-12\n7        NaT  2015-12-14\n8 2016-01-06  2015-12-14\n9        NaT  2015-12-15\n\ndf_test['Difference'] = df_test['First_Date'].sub(df_test['Second Date'], axis=0)\ndf_test.head()         \nOut[22]: \n  First_Date Second Date  Difference\n0 2016-02-09  2015-11-19     82 days\n1 2016-01-06  2015-11-30     37 days\n2        NaT  2015-12-04         NaT\n3 2016-01-06  2015-12-08     29 days\n4        NaT  2015-12-09         NaT\n\ndf_test['Difference'] = df_test[['Difference']].apply(pd.to_numeric)     \n\ndf_test.head()\nOut[25]: \n  First_Date Second Date    Difference\n0 2016-02-09  2015-11-19  7.084800e+15\n1 2016-01-06  2015-11-30  3.196800e+15\n2        NaT  2015-12-04           NaN\n3 2016-01-06  2015-12-08  2.505600e+15\n4        NaT  2015-12-09           NaN\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that the `Difference` column contains `Timedelta` objects, which you attempted to convert directly to numeric values. This resulted in large numbers that represent the differences in nanoseconds. To get the difference in days as integers, you can extract the number of days from the `Timedelta` objects.\n\nHere's how you can adjust your code to achieve the desired result:\n\n```python\n# Ensure that the date columns are in datetime format\ndf_test['First_Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df_test['First_Date'])\ndf_test['Second Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df_test['Second Date'])\n\n# Calculate the difference in days\ndf_test['Difference'] = (df_test['First_Date'] - df_test['Second Date']).dt.days\n\n# Display the resulting DataFrame\nprint(df_test.head())\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `pd.to_datetime()` is used to ensure that your date columns are in datetime format.\n- `df_test['First_Date'] - df_test['Second Date']` calculates the difference as a `Timedelta` object.\n- `.dt.days` extracts the number of days from the `Timedelta` object and gives you an integer representation.\n\nThis will give you a new `Difference` column with the differences in days as integers."
