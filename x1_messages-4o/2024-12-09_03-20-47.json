That is, it has to be either a semicolon or a comma followed by a space. Individual commas without trailing spaces should be left untouched. For instance, the string \"b-staged divinylsiloxane-bis-benzocyclobutene [124221-30-3], mesitylene [000108-67-8]; polymerized 1,2-dihydro-2,2,4- trimethyl quinoline [026780-96-1]\" should be split into a list containing the following: ('b-staged divinylsiloxane-bis-benzocyclobutene [124221-30-3]' , 'mesitylene [000108-67-8]', 'polymerized 1,2-dihydro-2,2,4- trimethyl quinoline [026780-96-1]'). I am not experienced with regular expressions, which I believe might be needed here."

        "content": "To split a string using multiple delimiters in Python, particularly when one of the delimiters is a specific sequence (like a comma followed by a space), regular expressions can be very useful. You can utilize the `re` module to achieve this. Here's how you can split your string using either a semicolon or a comma followed by a space:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Your input string\ninput_string = \"b-staged divinylsiloxane-bis-benzocyclobutene [124221-30-3], mesitylene [000108-67-8]; polymerized 1,2-dihydro-2,2,4- trimethyl quinoline [026780-96-1]\"\n\n# Define the regular expression pattern for splitting\n# This pattern looks for either \"; \" or \", \" as delimiters\npattern = r';\\s*|,\\s+'\n\n# Use re.split to split the string based on the pattern\nresult = re.split(pattern, input_string)\n\n# Print the resulting list\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Regular Expression Pattern**: `r';\\s*|,\\s+'`\n  - `;\\s*`: Matches a semicolon followed by any amount of whitespace (including none).\n  - `,\\s+`: Matches a comma followed by at least one whitespace character (this ensures that individual commas without trailing spaces are not considered as delimiters).\n  - `|`: Acts as an OR operator, so the pattern will match either of the given delimiters.\n\n- **`re.split()` Function**: This function splits the string at each point where the regular expression matches, resulting in a list.\n\nBy using this approach, the string is split correctly based on the specified delimiters, and you get the desired list of elements."
