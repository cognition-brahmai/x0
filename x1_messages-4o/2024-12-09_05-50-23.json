The idea is to iterate over each element in the list and use it as a key to access the corresponding value from the dictionary. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndct = {'a': 3, 'b': 3, 'c': 5, 'd': 3}\nlst = ['c', 'd', 'a', 'b', 'd']\n\n# Create a new list with the corresponding values from the dictionary\nlstval = [dct[element] for element in lst]\n\nprint(lstval)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n[5, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n```\n\nThe list comprehension `[dct[element] for element in lst]` iterates over each element in `lst`, looks up the value in `dct` using that element as the key, and collects the result into a new list `lstval`."
