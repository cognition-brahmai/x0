I have a fresh install of Snow Leopard with the developer tools installed during the Snow Leopard installation. I installed Python 2.6.2, replacing the Snow Leopard's default Python 2.6.1. I've tried installing PIL using `easy_install`, `pip`, and by downloading the source and running `python setup.py build` manually, but I keep getting the same error (link to `pip` log: http://drop.io/gi2bgw6). I've noticed others have had success installing PIL using the Snow Leopard default Python 2.6.1, so why am I having difficulty getting it to work with 2.6.2?"

        "content": "Installing the Python Imaging Library (PIL) on Snow Leopard with an updated Python 2.6.2 can be a bit tricky due to compatibility and dependency issues. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get it installed:\n\n1. **Verify Python Installation**: Ensure that your Python 2.6.2 installation is correctly set up and that it's the version being used by default. You can check this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   ```\n\n   This should return Python 2.6.2.\n\n2. **Install Required Dependencies**: PIL depends on several libraries, so make sure you have the necessary development libraries installed. You can use `brew` to install these dependencies if you have Homebrew installed:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew install libjpeg libtiff little-cms\n   ```\n\n3. **Set Environment Variables**: Ensure the environment variables are set correctly, as PIL needs to know where to find the libraries. You might need to set `CFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` like this:\n\n   ```bash\n   export CFLAGS=\"-I/usr/local/include\"\n   export LDFLAGS=\"-L/usr/local/lib\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Install PIL Using pip**: It's often easier to use `pip` for installation since it handles dependencies better. Run the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pillow\n   ```\n\n   Note that Pillow is a modern fork of PIL and is fully compatible with it. It also has better support for modern environments.\n\n5. **Build from Source**: If you prefer building from source, ensure you have all dependencies and try the installation again:\n\n   ```bash\n   wget http://effbot.org/downloads/Imaging-1.1.7.tar.gz\n   tar -xzf Imaging-1.1.7.tar.gz\n   cd Imaging-1.1.7\n   python setup.py build\n   python setup.py install\n   ```\n\n6. **Check Installation**: After installation, test if it works by importing it in Python:\n\n   ```python\n   import PIL\n   print(PIL.__version__)\n   ```\n\n   If no errors occur, your installation is successful.\n\nIf the above steps don't resolve your issue, consider checking the specific error messages in the pip log you linked for any additional clues. It might also be helpful to ensure that your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable includes the correct paths to your Python libraries."
