Interestingly, when I launch ipython and import the same module using the interpreter, it works without any issues. I've tried to understand how Python uses PYTHONPATH but I'm finding it confusing. Can anyone help me understand what's happening and how I can fix the ImportError?"

        "content": "Certainly! The \"ImportError: No module named ...\" typically occurs when Python cannot find the module you're trying to import. The fact that it works in IPython but not when running your script suggests that there might be a difference in the environment or paths used by IPython and your script.\n\nHere are a few steps to help diagnose and fix the problem:\n\n1. **Check PYTHONPATH**: \n   - `PYTHONPATH` is an environment variable which you can set to add additional directories where Python will look for modules and packages.\n   - You can check the current `PYTHONPATH` in your script by printing it:\n\n     ```python\n     import sys\n     print(sys.path)\n     ```\n\n   - Compare this output with the output of `sys.path` when you run it in IPython. They should match or at least include the directories where your modules are located.\n\n2. **Virtual Environments**: \n   - If you are using a virtual environment, ensure that it is activated when you run your script. The virtual environment might have its own set of installed packages separate from the global Python installation.\n\n3. **Script Location**:\n   - Ensure that your script is running in the same directory as your modules or that the directory is included in the `PYTHONPATH`.\n\n4. **Module Installation**:\n   - Make sure the module is installed in the Python environment you're using to run the script. You can check installed packages with `pip list` in the terminal where the script is executed.\n\n5. **Relative Imports**:\n   - If you are using relative imports in your scripts, make sure they are set up correctly. Sometimes converting relative imports to absolute ones can resolve issues.\n\n6. **Check for Name Conflicts**:\n   - Ensure there's no conflict with module names. For example, if you have a file with the same name as a standard library module, it can cause conflicts.\n\n7. **Different Python Versions**:\n   - Make sure you are using the same version of Python for both IPython and your script. Different versions might have different modules installed.\n\n8. **Running the Script**:\n   - Try running the script with the Python interpreter directly to see if there's a difference:\n\n     ```bash\n     python your_script.py\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify the cause of the ImportError and correct it. If you have more specific details about the error or your setup, feel free to share them for further assistance."
