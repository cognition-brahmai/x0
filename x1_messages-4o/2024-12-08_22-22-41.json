I've included some basic styling for visual appeal and an image to illustrate the concept of work-life balance.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Advantages of a 4-Day Work Week</title>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n            line-height: 1.6;\n            margin: 20px;\n            background-color: #f4f4f9;\n            color: #333;\n        }\n        h1 {\n            color: #2c3e50;\n            text-align: center;\n        }\n        ul {\n            list-style-type: disc;\n            margin: 20px auto;\n            padding: 0;\n            max-width: 600px;\n        }\n        li {\n            background: #e8e8e8;\n            margin: 10px 0;\n            padding: 10px;\n            border-radius: 5px;\n        }\n        .image-container {\n            text-align: center;\n            margin: 20px 0;\n        }\n        img {\n            max-width: 100%;\n            height: auto;\n            border-radius: 10px;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Advantages of a 4-Day Work Week</h1>\n    <div class=\"image-container\">\n        <img src=\"https://example.com/work-life-balance.jpg\" alt=\"Work-Life Balance\">\n    </div>\n    <ul>\n        <li>Increased productivity: Employees often accomplish more in less time due to improved focus and motivation.</li>\n        <li>Improved work-life balance: More personal time allows employees to recharge, reducing burnout and stress.</li>\n        <li>Enhanced employee satisfaction: A shorter work week can lead to higher job satisfaction and better retention rates.</li>\n        <li>Environmental benefits: Fewer commuting days reduce carbon emissions and lower energy consumption.</li>\n        <li>Cost savings: Reduced office utility costs and potential savings on salaries for hourly employees.</li>\n    </ul>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nPlease note that you'll need to replace the image source URL (`https://example.com/work-life-balance.jpg`) with a valid image URL that you have access to or use a local image path.
