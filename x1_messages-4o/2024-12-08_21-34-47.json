Here's how you can format the sentence in Markdown and include it in a paragraph about recent outdoor activities:\n\n```markdown\n# Recent Outdoor Activities\n\nIn the past few weeks, I've been focusing on spending more time outdoors, enjoying the fresh air and the beauty of nature. One of my favorite activities has been taking walks around my neighborhood. **I went for the walk near my home**, which allowed me to explore the familiar yet ever-changing landscape. Each walk offers a new perspective, whether it's the vibrant color of the leaves in autumn or the peaceful stillness of an early morning. These walks have not only been refreshing but also a great way to clear my mind and stay active.\n```\n\nThis format uses headings and bold text to make the paragraph more engaging and easier to read."
