In my view, I have set up a formset factory for a VehicleForm with an extra form. The formset is initially generating only one form, which is what I want, but I want that one form to be required. However, when I dynamically add blank forms with JavaScript and 'vehicles_formset.empty_form', all those extra forms are required, which is not what I want. According to the Django documentation, the formset should be smart enough to ignore extra forms that were not changed, but this is not the behavior I am experiencing. Is there an attribute that I can change to at least make one form required? Here is my code:\n\n```python\ndef post(request):\n    VehicleFormSetFactory = formset_factory(VehicleForm, extra=1)\n    if request.POST:\n        vehicles_formset = VehicleFormSetFactory(request.POST)\n    else:\n        vehicles_formset = VehicleFormSetFactory()\n```\n\nAnd my template looks like this:\n\n```html\n    <div id=\"vehicle_forms\">\n        {{ vehicles_formset.management_form }}\n        {% for form in vehicles_formset.forms %}\n            <h4>Vehicle {{forloop.counter}}</h4>\n            <table>\n                {% include \"form.html\" %}\n            </table>\n        {% endfor %}\n    </div>\n```"

        "content": "To ensure that at least one form in your formset is required, and to handle the behavior of dynamically added forms via JavaScript, you can implement a few strategies in your Django view and JavaScript logic. Here's a step-by-step approach to help you achieve the desired behavior:\n\n### 1. Understanding `formset_factory` and Required Forms\n\nThe `formset_factory` creates a formset with a specified number of forms. By default, it considers empty forms as not required. You need to ensure that your formset validation logic checks for at least one valid form submission.\n\n### 2. Adjusting the View Logic\n\nModify your view to handle validation properly. You can check if at least one form contains valid data before saving:\n\n```python\nfrom django.forms import formset_factory\nfrom django.shortcuts import render\n\ndef post(request):\n    VehicleFormSetFactory = formset_factory(VehicleForm, extra=1)\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        vehicles_formset = VehicleFormSetFactory(request.POST)\n        if vehicles_formset.is_valid():\n            # Check if at least one form has been filled\n            has_valid_form = any(form.cleaned_data for form in vehicles_formset)\n            if has_valid_form:\n                # Process the valid forms\n                for form in vehicles_formset:\n                    if form.cleaned_data:\n                        # Save or process the form data\n                        form.save()\n            else:\n                # Add an error to the formset non-field errors\n                vehicles_formset.non_form_errors().append(\"At least one vehicle must be provided.\")\n    else:\n        vehicles_formset = VehicleFormSetFactory()\n\n    return render(request, 'your_template.html', {'vehicles_formset': vehicles_formset})\n```\n\n### 3. Adjusting JavaScript Logic\n\nWhen adding forms dynamically using JavaScript, ensure that the added forms follow the same logic as the initial formset. The `empty_form` is just a prototype; ensure your JavaScript logic appends forms correctly and updates management form input values like `TOTAL_FORMS`.\n\n### 4. Template Modifications\n\nEnsure your template includes proper management form fields and handles dynamic form addition correctly:\n\n```html\n<div id=\"vehicle_forms\">\n    {{ vehicles_formset.management_form }}\n    {% for form in vehicles_formset.forms %}\n        <h4>Vehicle {{ forloop.counter }}</h4>\n        <table>\n            {% include \"form.html\" %}\n        </table>\n    {% endfor %}\n</div>\n\n<button type=\"button\" id=\"add-vehicle-form\">Add Vehicle</button>\n\n<script>\ndocument.getElementById('add-vehicle-form').addEventListener('click', function() {\n    var formsetDiv = document.getElementById('vehicle_forms');\n    var totalForms = formsetDiv.querySelector('input[name$=TOTAL_FORMS]');\n    var formCount = parseInt(totalForms.value);\n    \n    // Clone the empty form\n    var newForm = formsetDiv.querySelector('table:last-of-type').cloneNode(true);\n    newForm.innerHTML = newForm.innerHTML.replace(/__prefix__/g, formCount);\n    \n    // Append the new form\n    formsetDiv.appendChild(newForm);\n    \n    // Update the management form's TOTAL_FORMS\n    totalForms.value = formCount + 1;\n});\n</script>\n```\n\n### 5. Ensure Form Template Includes\n\nMake sure your `form.html` includes proper input fields with correct `name` attributes to support dynamic addition.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you should be able to ensure that at least one form in your formset is required, while allowing dynamically added forms to be optional unless filled."
