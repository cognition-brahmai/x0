My models.py is shown below:\n\n```python\nfrom profiles.choices import SAMPLE_CHOICES\n\nclass Profile(models.Model):\n    user = models.ForeignKey(User, unique=True, verbose_name_('user'))\n    choice_field = models.CharField(_('Some choices...'), choices=SAMPLE_CHOICES, max_length=50)\n```\nI have also created a form class as shown:\n\n```python\nclass ProfileForm(forms.ModelForm):\n    choice_field = forms.MultipleChoiceField(choices=SAMPLE_CHOICES, widget=forms.CheckboxSelectMultiple)\n\n    class Meta:\n        model = Profile\n```\nIn my views.py, I have:\n\n```python\nif request.method == \"POST\":\n    profile_form = form_class(request.POST, instance=profile)\n    if profile_form.is_valid():\n        ...\n        profile.save()\nreturn render_to_response(template_name, {\"profile_form\": profile_form,}, context_instance=RequestContext(request))\n```\nWhen I submit a POST, I can see that only one value is being sent:\n\n```python\nchoice_field u'choice_three' \n```\nAnd the local vars params is sending a list:\n\n```python\n[u'choice_one', u'choice_two', u'choice_three']\n```\nHowever, I get an error saying \"Error binding parameter 7 - probably unsupported type.\" Do I need to process the multiple choice field further in the view? Is my model field type correct? I would appreciate any help or reference."

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that the `CharField` model type is not suitable for storing multiple choices directly. When you use a `MultipleChoiceField` in a form, it returns a list of selected values, but `CharField` expects a single string value.\n\nTo handle multiple selections, you have a few options:\n\n### Option 1: Use `TextField` with a custom method to store multiple choices\n\nYou can convert the list to a string (e.g., using a delimiter like a comma) before saving it to the database, and then convert it back to a list when retrieving it.\n\n**Update your `models.py`:**\n\n```python\nclass Profile(models.Model):\n    user = models.ForeignKey(User, unique=True, verbose_name=_('user'))\n    choice_field = models.TextField(_('Some choices...'))  # Use TextField to store a serialized list\n\n    def get_choice_field_list(self):\n        return self.choice_field.split(',') if self.choice_field else []\n\n    def set_choice_field_list(self, choices):\n        self.choice_field = ','.join(choices)\n```\n\n**Update your `views.py`:**\n\n```python\nif request.method == \"POST\":\n    profile_form = ProfileForm(request.POST, instance=profile)\n    if profile_form.is_valid():\n        profile = profile_form.save(commit=False)\n        profile.set_choice_field_list(profile_form.cleaned_data['choice_field'])\n        profile.save()\n```\n\n### Option 2: Use a Many-to-Many relationship\n\nIf the choices are dynamic or related to another model, you might consider using a Many-to-Many relationship.\n\n**Update your `models.py`:**\n\n```python\nclass Choice(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n\nclass Profile(models.Model):\n    user = models.ForeignKey(User, unique=True, verbose_name=_('user'))\n    choices = models.ManyToManyField(Choice, verbose_name=_('Some choices...'))\n```\n\n**Update your `forms.py`:**\n\n```python\nclass ProfileForm(forms.ModelForm):\n    choices = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(queryset=Choice.objects.all(), widget=forms.CheckboxSelectMultiple)\n\n    class Meta:\n        model = Profile\n        fields = ['choices']\n```\n\n**Update your `views.py`:**\n\n```python\nif request.method == \"POST\":\n    profile_form = ProfileForm(request.POST, instance=profile)\n    if profile_form.is_valid():\n        profile_form.save()\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe first option is suitable if you want to keep your current choice system and the choices are not related to any other model. The second option is better if your choices are dynamic or represent entities that have their own data.\n\nMake sure to migrate your database to reflect the changes in your models by using Django's migration commands:\n\n```bash\npython manage.py makemigrations\npython manage.py migrate\n```\n\nChoose the approach that best fits your application's requirements."
