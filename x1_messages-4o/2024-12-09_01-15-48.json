The main reason for this is to take advantage of the new \"Sync objects\" feature. While Nvidia has supported such an extension since the Geforce 256 days (gl_nv_fences), there does not seem to be any equivalent functionality on ATI hardware before OpenGL 3.0+. My code extensively uses glut/freeglut, glu functions, OpenGL 2 extensions and CUDA (on supported hardware). I am facing a problem due to the mutual incompatibility of \"gl3.h\" and \"gl.h\" as stated in gl3.h. Is there a GL3 glut equivalent? Furthermore, upon examining the CUDA-toolkit header files, it appears that GL-CUDA interoperability is only available when using older versions of OpenGL, as cuda_gl_interop.h includes gl.h. Is there something I am overlooking?"

        "content": "Porting your application to OpenGL 3.0+ while maintaining compatibility with CUDA and GLUT can be challenging due to the mutual incompatibility issues you mentioned. Here's a breakdown of potential solutions and considerations:\n\n1. **GL3 and GLUT/FreeGLUT**: \n   - GLUT and FreeGLUT are designed with compatibility for older OpenGL versions in mind. For OpenGL 3.0+ and beyond, you might want to consider using a more modern context creation and management library, such as GLFW or SDL. These libraries are designed to work well with newer OpenGL versions and provide better support for core profiles and modern OpenGL features.\n\n2. **GL3 and GL Compatibility**:\n   - Since `gl3.h` and `gl.h` are mutually exclusive, you need to ensure that your application is set up to use the core profile if you want to leverage OpenGL 3.0+ features. This involves creating an OpenGL context that specifically requests a core profile. GLFW and SDL can help you set this up properly.\n\n3. **OpenGL and CUDA Interoperability**:\n   - CUDA's OpenGL interoperability is indeed tied to certain versions of OpenGL. If `cuda_gl_interop.h` includes `gl.h`, it suggests that it might not directly support newer OpenGL contexts. However, you can still use OpenGL 3.0+ features and maintain CUDA interoperability by ensuring that the OpenGL context is compatible with the version expected by CUDA. This might involve careful management of which features you use and potentially using compatibility profiles where necessary.\n\n4. **Managing Extensions and Compatibility**:\n   - If you're using OpenGL extensions heavily, consider using a library like GLEW or GLAD to manage them. These libraries can help you load and use OpenGL extensions more easily and can be configured to work with both core and compatibility profiles.\n\n5. **Refactoring for Compatibility**:\n   - Carefully refactor your application to separate the parts of the code that are dependent on older OpenGL functions. You might need to create abstraction layers that can switch between different OpenGL versions or profiles depending on the capabilities of the hardware and drivers.\n\n6. **Testing Across Platforms**:\n   - As you're targeting multiple platforms, ensure thorough testing on all of them. OpenGL support might vary slightly between Windows, Linux, and MacOS, and it's crucial to account for these differences, especially when dealing with OpenGL and CUDA interoperability.\n\nBy taking these steps, you should be able to port your application to OpenGL 3.0+ while maintaining the necessary compatibility with CUDA and considering potential replacements for GLUT."
