Here are the typical return values for major operating systems:\n\n1. **Windows**: \n   - `'win32'`: This is returned for all versions of Windows, irrespective of whether it's a 32-bit or 64-bit version.\n\n2. **Linux**: \n   - `'linux'`: This is the return value for Linux-based systems.\n\n3. **Mac OS**:\n   - `'darwin'`: This is returned for macOS systems.\n\nThese values help in writing platform-specific code in Python by allowing you to check which operating system the code is running on."
