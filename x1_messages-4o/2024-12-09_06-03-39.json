        "content": "To sort the output of `cProfile` by 'percall', you need to use the `-s` option followed by a valid sort key. The key 'percall' is not directly available, but you can achieve this by using the 'tottime' or 'cumtime' sort keys and then manually calculating the per-call time if needed. However, to sort by time per call directly, you would typically use 'tottime' or 'cumtime' and then examine the 'percall' column in the output.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Use the `-s` option with either 'tottime' or 'cumtime':\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m cProfile -s tottime myscript.py\n   ```\n\n   or\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m cProfile -s cumtime myscript.py\n   ```\n\n2. Analyze the output, which should include a 'percall' column representing the time per call. The 'tottime' column represents the total time spent in the given function (excluding time made in calls to sub-functions), and 'cumtime' is the cumulative time spent in this and all sub-functions.\n\nFor a more detailed analysis and additional sort keys, you might consider using the `pstats` module to create a more customized profiling report. Here's a basic example of how to do this programmatically:\n\n```python\nimport pstats\n\n# Load the profile data from a file\np = pstats.Stats('profile_output_file')\n\n# Sort the data by 'tottime' or 'cumtime'\np.sort_stats('tottime')\n\n# Print the profiling result\np.print_stats()\n```\n\nTo generate the profile output file, you would run:\n\n```bash\npython -m cProfile -o profile_output_file myscript.py\n```\n\nThis approach gives you more control over the sorting and analysis of the profiling data."
