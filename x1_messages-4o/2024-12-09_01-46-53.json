        "content": "To achieve the opposite of `np.repeat(x, 2)`, where you have a repeated array and want to revert it back to the original array, you can use slicing to select every second element. \n\nFor example, if you have an array that was created by repeating elements, you can use slicing like this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original repeated array\nrepeated_x = np.array([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4])\n\n# Recover the original array\noriginal_x = repeated_x[::2]\nprint(original_x)\n```\n\nFor the problem with array `y`, where you want to delete every other element, you can use slicing to select every other element starting from the second element (index 1):\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ny = np.array([1, 7, 9, 2, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4])\n\n# Select every other element starting from index 1\nresult_y = y[1::2]\nprint(result_y)\n```\n\nThis will give you the desired output:\n\n```python\narray([7, 2, 8, 3])\n```\n\nIn both cases, slicing is a powerful and efficient way to manipulate arrays in Python using NumPy."
