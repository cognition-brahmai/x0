        "content": "Certainly! To create an Excel table using Ruby that highlights the differences between \"property\" and \"attribute\" in object-oriented programming, you can use the `write_xlsx` gem to generate Excel files. Below, I'll provide an example of how you can achieve this.\n\nFirst, you'll need to install the `write_xlsx` gem if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\ngem install write_xlsx\n```\n\nThen, you can use the following Ruby script to create an Excel file with a table that explains the differences and provides examples:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'write_xlsx'\n\n# Create a new Excel workbook\nworkbook  = WriteXLSX.new('OOP_Concepts.xlsx')\n\n# Add a worksheet\nworksheet = workbook.add_worksheet\n\n# Define the headers\nheaders = ['Concept', 'Definition', 'Real-World Example']\n\n# Write the headers in the first row\nheaders.each_with_index do |header, index|\n  worksheet.write(0, index, header)\nend\n\n# Define the data for properties and attributes\ndata = [\n  ['Property', \n   'A property is a characteristic of an object, usually represented by data fields. Properties are accessed using getter and setter methods.', \n   'Example: In a Car class, properties can be color, make, and model.'],\n  \n  ['Attribute', \n   'An attribute is similar to a property but often refers to data stored in a database or an entity. In some contexts, attributes are used interchangeably with properties.', \n   'Example: In a database record for a Car, attributes might include registration number, owner name, etc.']\n]\n\n# Write the data to the worksheet\ndata.each_with_index do |row, row_index|\n  row.each_with_index do |item, col_index|\n    worksheet.write(row_index + 1, col_index, item)\n  end\nend\n\n# Format the header row\nheader_format = workbook.add_format\nheader_format.set_bold\nheader_format.set_bg_color('yellow')\nheader_format.set_align('center')\n\n# Apply the format to the headers\nworksheet.set_row(0, nil, header_format)\n\n# Format the rest of the rows\nworksheet.set_column(0, 2, 50) # Set the column width for readability\n\n# Close the workbook to save the changes\nworkbook.close\n\nputs \"Excel file created successfully as 'OOP_Concepts.xlsx'.\"\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Headers**: The headers for the table are defined and written to the first row of the worksheet.\n- **Data**: This consists of rows that describe the concept, its definition, and a real-world example.\n- **Writing to Excel**: Each piece of data is written to the worksheet, row by row.\n- **Formatting**: The headers are bolded and highlighted with a yellow background for clarity.\n- **File Creation**: The Excel file is saved as 'OOP_Concepts.xlsx'.\n\nWhen you run this script, it will generate an Excel file with a table that visually distinguishes between \"property\" and \"attribute\" in object-oriented programming, along with definitions and examples for each."
