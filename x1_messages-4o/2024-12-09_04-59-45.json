I found python-dateutil which seems perfect for my needs but I'm having trouble installing it. I managed to unpack the .tar.gz2 distribution using 7-zip but don't know what to do next. When I try to run setup.py, it gives me an error saying \"No module named setuptools\". How do I proceed?"

        "content": "To install `python-dateutil` on a Windows system for Python 2.6, you'll need to first ensure that you have `setuptools` installed, as it is required for the installation of many Python packages. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you through the process:\n\n1. **Install Setuptools:**\n\n   - Download the `ez_setup.py` script from the Setuptools website: https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py\n   - Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded `ez_setup.py`.\n   - Run the following command to install `setuptools`:\n     ```\n     python ez_setup.py\n     ```\n\n2. **Install python-dateutil:**\n\n   - If you haven't already, download the `python-dateutil` package from the Python Package Index (PyPI) or use the version you have already unpacked.\n   - Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where `setup.py` is located in your unpacked `python-dateutil` directory.\n   - Run the following command to install `python-dateutil`:\n     ```\n     python setup.py install\n     ```\n\n3. **Alternative Method Using pip:**\n\n   If you can upgrade to a slightly newer version of Python or if you already have `pip` installed, you can use it to simplify the installation process:\n   \n   - Open a command prompt and run the following command to install `python-dateutil` using `pip`:\n     ```\n     pip install python-dateutil\n     ```\n\nIf you encounter any issues with `pip`, you might need to install it first. Here's how you can do that:\n\n- Download `get-pip.py` from https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py.\n- Run the `get-pip.py` script using Python:\n  ```\n  python get-pip.py\n  ```\n\nOnce `setuptools` and `pip` are installed, installing packages like `python-dateutil` becomes much easier. Also, consider upgrading to a more recent version of Python if possible, as Python 2.6 is quite outdated and might have compatibility issues with newer packages."
