I'm trying to work with psycopg2, and I notice that although there are .commit() and .rollback() methods, there doesn't seem to be a .begin() method or something similar to start a transaction. Ideally, I would like to accomplish the following:\n\n```python\ndb.begin() # possibly even set the isolation level here\ncurs = db.cursor()\ncursor.execute('select etc... for update')\n...\ncursor.execute('update ... etc.')\ndb.commit();\n```\n\nAdditionally, how could I set or change the isolation level?"

        "content": "In psycopg2 and the Python DB-API, transactions are handled automatically when you establish a connection to the database. Here's how you can perform database transactions using psycopg2:\n\n### Starting a Transaction\n\nIn psycopg2, transactions are automatically started when you perform any operation that requires one. There is no explicit `begin()` method. The transaction begins when you execute your first SQL command after connecting to the database, and it will remain open until you either commit or roll back.\n\n### Performing Operations\n\nHere's a typical example of how you would perform operations within a transaction:\n\n```python\nimport psycopg2\n\n# Establish a connection to the database\nconn = psycopg2.connect(\n    dbname=\"your_dbname\", \n    user=\"your_user\", \n    password=\"your_password\", \n    host=\"your_host\"\n)\n\n# Create a cursor object\ncur = conn.cursor()\n\ntry:\n    # Execute a query that starts a transaction\n    cur.execute('SELECT ... FOR UPDATE')\n\n    # Perform other operations\n    cur.execute('UPDATE ...')\n\n    # Commit the transaction\n    conn.commit()\nexcept Exception as e:\n    # If something goes wrong, rollback the transaction\n    conn.rollback()\n    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\nfinally:\n    # Close the cursor and connection\n    cur.close()\n    conn.close()\n```\n\n### Setting the Isolation Level\n\nYou can set the isolation level of a transaction using the `set_isolation_level()` method of the connection object. psycopg2 provides different isolation levels such as `ISOLATION_LEVEL_AUTOCOMMIT`, `ISOLATION_LEVEL_READ_COMMITTED`, `ISOLATION_LEVEL_REPEATABLE_READ`, `ISOLATION_LEVEL_SERIALIZABLE`, and `ISOLATION_LEVEL_DEFAULT`.\n\nHere's how to set the isolation level:\n\n```python\nfrom psycopg2 import extensions\n\n# Assuming 'conn' is your connection object\nconn.set_isolation_level(extensions.ISOLATION_LEVEL_SERIALIZABLE)\n\n# You can also use other levels like:\n# conn.set_isolation_level(extensions.ISOLATION_LEVEL_READ_COMMITTED)\n# conn.set_isolation_level(extensions.ISOLATION_LEVEL_REPEATABLE_READ)\n```\n\n### Autocommit Mode\n\nIf you want to execute commands without explicitly managing transactions, you can set the connection to autocommit mode:\n\n```python\nconn.autocommit = True\n```\n\nWhen in autocommit mode, every command is executed in its own transaction, which is immediately committed.\n\n### Summary\n\n- Transactions start automatically with the first SQL command.\n- Use `conn.commit()` to save changes and `conn.rollback()` to revert in case of errors.\n- Set the isolation level using `conn.set_isolation_level()`.\n- Use autocommit mode for executing commands without explicit transaction control. \n\nBy following these guidelines, you can effectively manage transactions in psycopg2."
