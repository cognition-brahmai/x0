Then I'm sending the keystroke Alt+Tab to switch over to it from the DOS console. Is there a more reliable way to do this, as my current method is not foolproof?"

        "content": "To programmatically activate a window in Windows using Python, you can use the `pygetwindow` library in combination with `pyautogui` or `pywinauto`. These libraries provide more control and reliability compared to sending keystrokes manually. Here's a more reliable approach:\n\n1. **Using `pygetwindow` and `pyautogui`:**\n\n   First, install the required libraries if you haven't already:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pygetwindow pyautogui\n   ```\n\n   Then, use the following code to activate a window by its title:\n\n   ```python\n   import pygetwindow as gw\n   import pyautogui\n   import time\n\n   # Replace 'Your Window Title' with the actual title of the window you want to activate\n   window_title = 'Your Window Title'\n\n   # Get a list of all open windows\n   windows = gw.getAllTitles()\n\n   # Find the target window\n   if window_title in windows:\n       window = gw.getWindowsWithTitle(window_title)[0]\n       window.activate()\n       time.sleep(0.5)  # Allow some time for the window to activate\n   else:\n       print(f\"Window '{window_title}' not found.\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Using `pywinauto`:**\n\n   You can also use `pywinauto` for more complex interactions. First, install the library:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pywinauto\n   ```\n\n   Here's how you can use it to activate a window:\n\n   ```python\n   from pywinauto import Application\n\n   # Replace 'Your Window Title' with the title of the window you want to activate\n   window_title = 'Your Window Title'\n\n   # Connect to the window\n   try:\n       app = Application().connect(title=window_title)\n       window = app.window(title=window_title)\n       window.set_focus()\n   except Exception as e:\n       print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n   ```\n\nThese methods should offer more reliability and precision compared to using `Alt+Tab` with keystrokes. Make sure to replace `'Your Window Title'` with the exact title of the window you are trying to activate."
