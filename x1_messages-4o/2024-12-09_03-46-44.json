        "content": "To determine the current working directory in Python, you can use the `os` module, which provides a portable way of using operating system-dependent functionality. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Determine the Current Directory:**\n\n   You can find out what the current working directory is by using the `os.getcwd()` function. Here\u2019s a small snippet of code you can use:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n\n   current_directory = os.getcwd()\n   print(\"Current Directory:\", current_directory)\n   ```\n\n   This will print the current working directory to the console.\n\n2. **Change the Current Directory:**\n\n   To change the current working directory, you can use the `os.chdir()` function. You need to provide the path to the directory you want to switch to. Here's how you can do it:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n\n   new_directory = r'C:\\path\\to\\your\\modules'\n   os.chdir(new_directory)\n\n   # Verify the change\n   current_directory = os.getcwd()\n   print(\"New Current Directory:\", current_directory)\n   ```\n\n   Make sure to replace `C:\\path\\to\\your\\modules` with the actual path to the directory where your modules are located. The `r` before the string denotes a raw string, which is useful in Windows file paths to avoid issues with backslashes.\n\nBy using these functions, you can easily check and change the current working directory in your Python environment."
