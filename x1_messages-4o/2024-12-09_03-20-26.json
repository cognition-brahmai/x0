This is because single curly braces are used for marking placeholders in the format string.\n\nHere's how you can format a string to include curly braces:\n\n```python\nformatted_string = \"{{{}}}\".format(3)\nprint(formatted_string)\n```\n\nThis will correctly output:\n\n```\n{3}\n```\n\nIn the format string `{{{}}}`, the double curly braces `{{` and `}}` are interpreted as literal `{` and `}` characters in the output, while `{}` is used as a placeholder for the value `3`."
