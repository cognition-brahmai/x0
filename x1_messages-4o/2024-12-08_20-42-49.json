Here is a Python code snippet that does this:\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(word):\n    # A word is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards\n    return word == word[::-1]\n\ndef find_palindromes(text):\n    # Remove punctuation and split the text into words\n    import re\n    words = re.findall(r'\\b\\w+\\b', text)\n    \n    # Find and print palindromes\n    palindromes = [word for word in words if is_palindrome(word)]\n    return palindromes\n\n# Given string\ntext = \"dog, racecar, radar, madam\"\n\n# Find palindromes\npalindromes = find_palindromes(text)\n\n# Print the palindromes\nprint(\"Palindromes found:\", palindromes)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- The `is_palindrome` function checks if a word is the same when reversed.\n- The `find_palindromes` function uses a regular expression to extract words from the input string, and then filters these words to find palindromes.\n- Finally, the code prints out the list of palindromes found in the input string. \n\nWhen you run this code with the given string, it will output:\n\n```\nPalindromes found: ['racecar', 'radar', 'madam']\n```"
