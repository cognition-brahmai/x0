One CSV file, 'Mapping', has four columns: 'Device_Name', 'GDN', 'Device_Type', and 'Device_OS', all of which are populated. The other CSV file, 'Data', has the same columns, but only the 'Device_Name' column is populated, the other three are blank. I want my Python code to open both files and for each 'Device_Name' in the 'Data' file, map its 'GDN', 'Device_Type', and 'Device_OS' value from the 'Mapping' file. I have some code that I tried to use to accomplish this, but it's returning an 'Attribute Error'. How can I correctly create a nested dictionary for this purpose?"

        "content": "To achieve this task, you can use Python's CSV module to read the CSV files and create a nested dictionary to map the data correctly. The key to solving this problem is to iterate through the 'Mapping' CSV file first to create a dictionary with 'Device_Name' as the key and the other columns as values. Then, you can iterate through the 'Data' CSV file and populate the missing columns based on the dictionary you created from the 'Mapping' file.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to implement this:\n\n1. Read the 'Mapping' CSV file and build a dictionary with 'Device_Name' as the key.\n2. Read the 'Data' CSV file and use the dictionary to fill in the missing columns.\n\nHere's the code to accomplish this:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\n# Initialize an empty dictionary to store mapping data\nmapping_dict = {}\n\n# Open the 'Mapping' CSV file and read its contents\nwith open('Mapping.csv', mode='r', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as mapping_file:\n    reader = csv.DictReader(mapping_file)\n    for row in reader:\n        # Use 'Device_Name' as the key and store the other values in a dictionary\n        device_name = row['Device_Name']\n        mapping_dict[device_name] = {\n            'GDN': row['GDN'],\n            'Device_Type': row['Device_Type'],\n            'Device_OS': row['Device_OS']\n        }\n\n# Prepare to update the 'Data' CSV file\nupdated_data = []\n\n# Open the 'Data' CSV file and read its contents\nwith open('Data.csv', mode='r', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as data_file:\n    reader = csv.DictReader(data_file)\n    for row in reader:\n        device_name = row['Device_Name']\n        # Check if the 'Device_Name' exists in the mapping dictionary\n        if device_name in mapping_dict:\n            # Update the row with the mapped values\n            row.update(mapping_dict[device_name])\n        # Add the updated row to the list of updated data\n        updated_data.append(row)\n\n# Write the updated data back to a new CSV file\nwith open('Updated_Data.csv', mode='w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as output_file:\n    fieldnames = ['Device_Name', 'GDN', 'Device_Type', 'Device_OS']\n    writer = csv.DictWriter(output_file, fieldnames=fieldnames)\n    \n    # Write the header\n    writer.writeheader()\n    \n    # Write the updated data\n    writer.writerows(updated_data)\n\nprint(\"Data has been successfully updated and written to 'Updated_Data.csv'.\")\n```\n\nThis script does the following:\n\n- Reads the 'Mapping.csv' file and constructs a dictionary (`mapping_dict`) that maps each `Device_Name` to its corresponding details (`GDN`, `Device_Type`, `Device_OS`).\n- Reads the 'Data.csv' file, and for each `Device_Name`, it fills in the missing details using the `mapping_dict`.\n- Writes the updated data to a new CSV file called 'Updated_Data.csv'.\n\nMake sure that the CSV files are in the same directory as the script or provide the full path to the files if they are located elsewhere. This code assumes that both CSV files have headers that match the column names used in the script."
