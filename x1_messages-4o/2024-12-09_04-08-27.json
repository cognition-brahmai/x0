In Python 3.1 documentation, it's straightforward, but the facilities for doing this in 2.6 don't seem to be there. If the methods described in 3.1 aren't available, can I close stdin and reopen in binary mode? I am using 'type' in a MS-DOS shell to pipe the contents of a binary file to my python code, equivalent of a Unix 'cat' command. However, whenever I test this, I always get one byte less than the expected file size. Why is this happening? I am using Java/JAR/Jython because one of my main external libraries is only available as a Java JAR. Is there a way to fix this in Python 2.6?"

        "content": "Reading binary data from `stdin` in Python 2.6 on Windows can be tricky due to the differences in how input streams are handled between Unix-like systems and Windows. By default, the standard input (`sys.stdin`) is opened in text mode, which can cause issues with binary data, such as unwanted conversions or truncation.\n\nTo read binary data from `stdin` in Python 2.6 on Windows, you can use the `msvcrt` module to set the mode of `stdin` to binary. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport msvcrt\n\n# Set stdin to binary mode\nmsvcrt.setmode(sys.stdin.fileno(), os.O_BINARY)\n\n# Read binary data from stdin\nbinary_data = sys.stdin.read()\n\n# Process the binary data as needed\nprint(\"Read {} bytes\".format(len(binary_data)))\n```\n\nMake sure to import `os` as well for the `os.O_BINARY` constant. This will ensure that `stdin` is read in binary mode, preventing any unwanted data conversion or truncation.\n\nRegarding the issue of getting one byte less than the expected file size, it could be due to several factors:\n\n1. **File Reading**: Double-check that the entire file is being piped into your script. Ensure that the command you're using in the MS-DOS shell is correctly reading the full file.\n\n2. **Buffering or EOF Character**: In some cases, especially on Windows, an EOF (End-of-File) character might be interpreted or misinterpreted, leading to truncation. By setting the mode to binary, you should be able to avoid this issue.\n\n3. **Encoding Issues**: Ensure that no encoding or decoding is mistakenly applied to the binary stream.\n\nIf you're using Jython, the way Java handles streams might also come into play, but the approach above should be applicable since Jython aims to be compatible with CPython's behavior.\n\nLastly, ensure that any tools or commands used in the pipeline (like `type`) are correctly handling binary data and not inadvertently altering it."
