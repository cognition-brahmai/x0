In Scala, you can express the idea of \"His linguistic repertoire consists of four distinct languages\" without using a verb for speaking ability by focusing on the collection aspect. Here's an alternative phrasing:\n\n```scala\nval hisLinguisticRepertoire = Set(\"Language1\", \"Language2\", \"Language3\", \"Language4\")\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, `hisLinguisticRepertoire` is a set containing four distinct languages. This representation highlights the possession or inclusion of languages in his repertoire without directly referencing his ability to speak them."
