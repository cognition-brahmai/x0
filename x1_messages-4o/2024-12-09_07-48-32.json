        "content": "Certainly! Here are some machine learning programming exercises that fit your criteria:\n\n1. **Spam Email Classifier:**\n   - **Problem:** Build a model to classify emails as spam or not spam.\n   - **Dataset:** Use the Enron email dataset or the SpamAssassin public dataset.\n   - **Evaluation:** Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a test set.\n\n2. **Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews:**\n   - **Problem:** Predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of movie reviews.\n   - **Dataset:** IMDB movie reviews dataset.\n   - **Evaluation:** Accuracy and F1-score on the test data.\n\n3. **House Price Prediction:**\n   - **Problem:** Predict the selling price of a house based on features like size, location, and number of bedrooms.\n   - **Dataset:** California housing dataset or the Ames housing dataset.\n   - **Evaluation:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).\n\n4. **Customer Churn Prediction:**\n   - **Problem:** Predict whether a customer will leave a service based on their usage patterns and demographic information.\n   - **Dataset:** Telco customer churn dataset.\n   - **Evaluation:** ROC AUC score and confusion matrix analysis.\n\n5. **Traffic Flow Prediction:**\n   - **Problem:** Predict the traffic flow in a city based on historical data.\n   - **Dataset:** UCI Machine Learning Repository contains relevant datasets.\n   - **Evaluation:** RMSE and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).\n\n6. **Handwritten Digit Recognition:**\n   - **Problem:** Classify handwritten digits from images.\n   - **Dataset:** MNIST dataset.\n   - **Evaluation:** Accuracy on the test set.\n\n7. **Credit Card Fraud Detection:**\n   - **Problem:** Detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data.\n   - **Dataset:** Kaggle's credit card fraud detection dataset.\n   - **Evaluation:** Precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.\n\n8. **Recommendation System:**\n   - **Problem:** Build a recommendation system for movies or products.\n   - **Dataset:** MovieLens dataset for movies or Amazon product review datasets.\n   - **Evaluation:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Hit ratio at top-K recommendations.\n\nThese exercises reflect real-world problems and can be done within a short time frame. You can find these datasets on platforms like Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or directly from the sources mentioned. Each task includes evaluation criteria to help you measure the effectiveness of your models."
