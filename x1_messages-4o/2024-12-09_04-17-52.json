I have my C library but I am unsure about the following steps: What files do I need to put and where? How do I import the library? Is there a way to auto wrap it to Python? I tried the ctypes tutorial on python.net but it doesn't seem to work, with the following error displaying when I try to run their code: \n```\nFile \"importtest.py\", line 1\n   >>> from ctypes import *\n   SyntaxError: invalid syntax\n```\nI would appreciate a detailed, step-by-step guidance on this."

        "content": "Wrapping a C library in Python using `ctypes` can be a bit daunting at first, but I'll guide you through the process step-by-step. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Prepare Your C Library\n\n1. **Compile Your C Library**: Make sure your C code is compiled into a shared library (a `.so` file on Linux, a `.dll` on Windows, or a `.dylib` on macOS). For example, on Linux, you might compile with:\n   ```bash\n   gcc -shared -o myclibrary.so -fPIC myclibrary.c\n   ```\n\n2. **Place the Shared Library**: Place the compiled shared library file in a directory that Python can access. This can be in the same directory as your Python script for simplicity.\n\n### Step 2: Create a Python Wrapper\n\n1. **Import Ctypes**: You need to import `ctypes` in your Python script, without the `>>>` symbols which are used in the interactive shell. Your import line should look like:\n   ```python\n   from ctypes import *\n   ```\n\n2. **Load the Shared Library**:\n   ```python\n   myclib = CDLL('./myclibrary.so')  # Use the correct file extension for your OS\n   ```\n\n3. **Define Function Prototypes**: You need to specify the argument and return types of the C functions you want to call. For example, if you have a C function `int add(int a, int b)`, you would do:\n   ```python\n   myclib.add.argtypes = (c_int, c_int)\n   myclib.add.restype = c_int\n   ```\n\n4. **Call the C Functions**: You can now call the C functions as if they were normal Python functions:\n   ```python\n   result = myclib.add(5, 3)\n   print(\"Result:\", result)\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Automate the Process (Optional)\n\nThere is no fully automated tool to wrap C libraries with `ctypes`, but you can use tools like `cffi` or `SWIG` for more complex libraries. These tools provide more features and can generate Python bindings automatically from C header files.\n\n### Troubleshooting the Error\n\nYour error indicates that you're trying to run code with `>>>` symbols, which are used in Python's interactive shell and not in scripts. Ensure your script only contains plain code, like this:\n\n```python\nfrom ctypes import *\n\n# Load the shared library\nmyclib = CDLL('./myclibrary.so')\n\n# Define function prototypes\nmyclib.add.argtypes = (c_int, c_int)\nmyclib.add.restype = c_int\n\n# Call the function\nresult = myclib.add(5, 3)\nprint(\"Result:\", result)\n```\n\n### Summary\n\n- Compile your C code to a shared library.\n- Place the shared library in a known location.\n- Use `ctypes` to load the library and define function prototypes.\n- Call the functions as needed.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to wrap your C library in Python using `ctypes`. If you encounter specific issues, feel free to ask for further clarification."
