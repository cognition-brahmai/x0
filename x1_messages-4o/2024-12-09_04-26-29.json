        "content": "To share a single global variable between two threads in Python, you need to use a synchronization mechanism to ensure that the threads access the variable in a thread-safe manner. The `threading` module provides a `Lock` class that you can use for this purpose.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to safely share and modify the global variable `a` between `thread1` and `thread2`:\n\n```python\nfrom threading import Thread, Lock\nimport time\n\na = 0  # global variable\nlock = Lock()  # create a lock object\n\ndef thread1(threadname):\n    global a  # declare 'a' as global to access the global variable\n    while True:\n        with lock:  # acquire the lock\n            print(f\"{threadname} reads a = {a}\")\n        time.sleep(1)\n\ndef thread2(threadname):\n    global a  # declare 'a' as global to access the global variable\n    while True:\n        with lock:  # acquire the lock\n            a += 1\n            print(f\"{threadname} modifies a to {a}\")\n        time.sleep(1)\n\nthread1 = Thread(target=thread1, args=(\"Thread-1\",))\nthread2 = Thread(target=thread2, args=(\"Thread-2\",))\n\nthread1.start()\nthread2.start()\n\nthread1.join()\nthread2.join()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Global Variable Access**: Use the `global` keyword inside each thread function to modify the global variable `a`.\n\n2. **Lock Usage**: Use a `Lock` to ensure that only one thread can access or modify the global variable `a` at a time. This prevents race conditions.\n\n3. **Acquiring the Lock**: Use a `with lock:` statement to automatically acquire and release the lock, which ensures that the critical section of the code is protected.\n\n4. **Infinite Loops**: Both threads are set to run in infinite loops, so ensure to provide a way to break these loops or terminate the program if needed.\n\nThis setup will allow `thread1` to read the value of `a` safely, while `thread2` modifies it, ensuring thread-safe operations."
