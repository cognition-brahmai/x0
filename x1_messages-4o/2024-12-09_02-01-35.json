Why is this happening?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to the scope of variables and the way `exec` handles them in Python. When you use `exec` within a function, it executes the code in the local scope of that function, not the global scope. This means that any imports or variable definitions made within the `exec` are local to that function and are not accessible outside of it.\n\nIn your example, when you define `code` and use `exec code` inside the `test` function, the `import random` statement is executed within the local scope of `test`. As a result, the `random` module is imported locally and not available in the global scope or to any other functions.\n\nTo solve this issue, you can explicitly pass the global and local dictionaries to the `exec` function so that the code is executed in the global scope. Here's how you can do that:\n\n```python\ncode = \"\"\"\nimport random\ndef f():\n    print(random.randint(0,9))\n\"\"\"\n\ndef test():\n    exec(code, globals())\n    f()\n\ntest()\n```\n\nBy passing `globals()` as the second argument to `exec`, you ensure that the execution environment includes the global scope, making the imported modules and defined functions available outside the `exec` block."
