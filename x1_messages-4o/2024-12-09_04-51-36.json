        "content": "In Python, the `range()` function only accepts integer arguments, which means you can't directly use it to iterate with a decimal step. However, you can achieve the same result using the `numpy` library or by employing a simple workaround using a while loop or a list comprehension with `arange()` from `numpy`. Here are a few ways to achieve this:\n\n### Using `numpy.arange()`:\nIf you're open to using external libraries, `numpy` is a great option.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nfor i in np.arange(0, 1.1, 0.1):\n    print(i)\n```\n\n### Using a `while` loop:\nYou can manually control the loop using a `while` loop.\n\n```python\ni = 0.0\nwhile i <= 1:\n    print(i)\n    i += 0.1\n```\n\n### Using list comprehension with `range()` and arithmetic:\nThis method doesn't require any external libraries and uses list comprehension.\n\n```python\nfor i in [x * 0.1 for x in range(11)]:\n    print(i)\n```\n\nAll of these methods will give you the desired iteration from 0 to 1 with a step of 0.1. Choose the method that best fits your needs and coding style!"
