Can you create a function to accomplish this task?"

        "content": "Certainly! To create a Valentine's Day themed poem generator, we'll use the JSON data to randomly select words and phrases to form a poem. Below is a Python function that accomplishes this task:\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport random\n\n# Sample JSON data\nvalentines_data = {\n    \"nouns\": [\n        \"love\",\n        \"heart\",\n        \"roses\",\n        \"cupid\"\n    ],\n    \"adjectives\": [\n        \"sweet\",\n        \"romantic\",\n        \"passionate\",\n        \"adorable\"\n    ],\n    \"verbs\": [\n        \"cherish\",\n        \"adore\",\n        \"embrace\",\n        \"caress\"\n    ],\n    \"phrases\": [\n        \"you are the love of my life\",\n        \"you complete me\",\n        \"you make my heart skip a beat\",\n        \"I am forever yours\"\n    ]\n}\n\ndef generate_poem(data):\n    poem_lines = []\n    \n    # Randomly select phrases to form the poem\n    for _ in range(4):  # Let's make it a 4-line poem\n        # Choose a random adjective, noun, and verb\n        adjective = random.choice(data['adjectives'])\n        noun = random.choice(data['nouns'])\n        verb = random.choice(data['verbs'])\n        \n        # Construct a line with the chosen words\n        line = f\"My {adjective} {noun}, I {verb} you.\"\n        poem_lines.append(line)\n    \n    # Add a random phrase at the end\n    poem_lines.append(random.choice(data['phrases']))\n    \n    # Join the lines to form the complete poem\n    return \"\\n\".join(poem_lines)\n\n# Generate and print the poem\nvalentines_poem = generate_poem(valentines_data)\nprint(valentines_poem)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Data Structure**: The JSON data is loaded into a dictionary, `valentines_data`, which holds lists of nouns, adjectives, verbs, and phrases.\n\n2. **Function `generate_poem`**:\n   - Randomly selects an adjective, noun, and verb from the JSON data to create a line of the poem.\n   - Constructs each line in the format \"My [adjective] [noun], I [verb] you.\"\n   - Appends a randomly selected phrase as the final line of the poem.\n   - Joins all lines to form the complete poem and returns it.\n\n3. **Example Output**: Each run will generate a different poem due to the randomness:\n   ```\n   My romantic heart, I embrace you.\n   My adorable cupid, I cherish you.\n   My sweet roses, I adore you.\n   My passionate love, I caress you.\n   You make my heart skip a beat\n   ```\n\nYou can adjust the number of lines or customize the structure as needed. Enjoy creating and sharing your Valentine's Day poems!"
