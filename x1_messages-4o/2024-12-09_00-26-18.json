        "content": "The error you are encountering is due to the fact that you are trying to access `parameters()` directly from the class `Network` rather than an instance of it. In Python, calling a method from a class requires an instance of that class to be passed as the first argument, usually referenced by `self`.\n\nHere's how you can resolve the error:\n\n1. You need to create an instance of the `Network` class.\n2. Then, call the `parameters()` method on that instance.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\n# Create an instance of the Network class\nnetwork = Network()\n\n# Pass the parameters of the instance to the optimizer\noptimizer = optim.SGD(network.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)\n```\n\nMake sure that everywhere you need to refer to the `Network`, you are using the instance `network`, not the class `Network` itself. This should resolve the `TypeError` you are encountering."
