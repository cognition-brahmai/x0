The article must be written in English and have a length of at least 1000 words. \n2. The article must have at least two tables, one with data on ocean temperatures and another with data on coral bleaching events. \n3. The article must include code snippets in both Python and R, demonstrating how the data was analyzed and visualized. \n4. The article must also be translated into Spanish and have a separate section discussing the cultural significance of coral reefs in Latin American countries. \nThe article in question discusses a study conducted over a period of three years, examining the effects of climate change on coral reefs in the Caribbean. The study utilized both in situ observations and satellite data to track changes in ocean temperatures and coral bleaching events. The results indicate a significant increase in both temperature and bleaching events over the three-year period, highlighting the urgent need for action to protect these vital ecosystems. The Python and R code used to analyze the data and create visualizations are included in the article, along with detailed explanations of the methodology used. Additionally, the article includes a section on the cultural significance of coral reefs in Latin America, exploring their role in local economies and traditions."

        "content": "Based on the provided criteria and content, the article in question can be classified as a science-based article. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Language and Length**: The article is written in English and meets the specified length requirement of at least 1000 words.\n\n2. **Tables**: The article includes at least two tables, one with data on ocean temperatures and another with data on coral bleaching events, which are essential for the scientific analysis of the topic.\n\n3. **Code Snippets**: The inclusion of code snippets in both Python and R for data analysis and visualization indicates a scientific approach to handling and interpreting data.\n\n4. **Translation and Cultural Discussion**: The translation into Spanish and the discussion on the cultural significance of coral reefs in Latin America add depth to the article, acknowledging the socio-cultural dimensions of the scientific issue.\n\n5. **Content Focus**: The article discusses a study on the effects of climate change on coral reefs, using scientific methods like in situ observations and satellite data, and presents results with significant implications for environmental science.\n\nAll these factors combined suggest that the article is primarily focused on scientific investigation and analysis, despite having a section on cultural significance, which enriches the scientific discourse by contextualizing the findings within Latin American culture."
