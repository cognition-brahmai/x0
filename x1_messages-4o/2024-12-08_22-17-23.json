Assume that the text is stored in a column named \"text\" in a table named \"documents\" in a SQL database. Please provide the necessary SQL database code to connect to the database and retrieve the text, as well as the Python code to modify the function to analyze the text from the database."

        "content": "To modify the `most_frequent_word` function to analyze text stored in a SQL database, you'll need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Connect to the SQL database and retrieve the text data.\n2. Implement the logic to find the most frequent word in the text.\n3. Return the result.\n\nHere's an example of how you could achieve this using Python with the `sqlite3` library, which is commonly used for working with SQLite databases. If you're using a different type of SQL database (such as MySQL or PostgreSQL), you'll need to adjust the connection code accordingly.\n\n### Sample Code\n\nFirst, make sure you have the necessary libraries:\n\n```bash\npip install sqlite3\n```\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport re\n\ndef get_text_from_db(db_path: str) -> str:\n    # Connect to the SQLite database\n    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)\n    cursor = conn.cursor()\n    \n    # Query to retrieve text from the \"documents\" table\n    cursor.execute(\"SELECT text FROM documents\")\n    \n    # Fetch all rows and concatenate text from each row\n    rows = cursor.fetchall()\n    text = \" \".join(row[0] for row in rows)\n    \n    # Close the database connection\n    conn.close()\n    \n    return text\n\ndef most_frequent_word(text: str) -> str:\n    # Use regex to find words and convert them to lower case\n    words = re.findall(r'\\w+', text.lower())\n    \n    # Count the frequency of each word\n    word_counts = Counter(words)\n    \n    # Find the most common word\n    most_common_word, _ = word_counts.most_common(1)[0]\n    \n    return most_common_word\n\n# Example usage\ndb_path = 'path_to_your_database.db'  # Replace with your database path\ntext = get_text_from_db(db_path)\nmost_frequent = most_frequent_word(text)\nprint(f\"The most frequent word is: {most_frequent}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Database Connection and Retrieval**:\n    - Establish a connection to the SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect`.\n    - Execute a SQL query to retrieve all text from the `documents` table.\n    - Concatenate all text entries into a single string.\n\n2. **Text Analysis**:\n    - Use regular expressions to split the text into words and convert them to lowercase for uniformity.\n    - Use `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each word.\n    - Retrieve the most common word using the `most_common` method.\n\n3. **Usage**:\n    - Replace `'path_to_your_database.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database.\n    - Call `get_text_from_db` to fetch text data, and then pass it to `most_frequent_word` to get the result.\n\nThis example assumes that you're working with an SQLite database. If you're using another type of SQL database, you'll need to use the appropriate library (e.g., `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL or `mysql-connector-python` for MySQL) and adjust the connection code accordingly."
