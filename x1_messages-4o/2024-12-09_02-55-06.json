I have a code snippet that achieves this using one for loop to compute the Euclidean distance for every row vector in matrix 'a' against all row vectors in matrix 'b'. How can I modify this code to perform the same task without using for loops?\n\nHere is the current code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\na = np.array([[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2]])\nb = np.array([[1,2,3,4],[1,1,1,1],[1,2,1,9]])\ndists = np.zeros((2, 3))\nfor i in range(2):\n      dists[i] = np.sqrt(np.sum(np.square(a[i] - b), axis=1))\n```"

        "content": "To eliminate the for loop and efficiently calculate the Euclidean distance between each pair of row vectors from matrices `a` and `b`, you can utilize NumPy's broadcasting and vectorization features. Here\u2019s how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([[1, 1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2, 2]])\nb = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 2, 1, 9]])\n\n# Calculate the squared differences, sum along the last axis and take the square root\ndists = np.sqrt(np.sum((a[:, np.newaxis, :] - b) ** 2, axis=2))\n\nprint(dists)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Broadcasting**: \n   - `a[:, np.newaxis, :]` reshapes `a` to a shape of `(2, 1, 4)` to enable broadcasting.\n   - This allows `a` to be broadcasted against `b`, which has a shape of `(3, 4)`. The result of `a[:, np.newaxis, :] - b` is a `(2, 3, 4)` array where each `(i, j)` entry is the difference between the `i-th` row of `a` and the `j-th` row of `b`.\n\n2. **Element-wise Squaring**: \n   - The differences are squared element-wise.\n\n3. **Summation**:\n   - Use `np.sum(..., axis=2)` to sum the squared differences across the last axis (which corresponds to the dimensions of the row vectors), resulting in a `(2, 3)` array where each element is the sum of squared differences between a row in `a` and a row in `b`.\n\n4. **Square Root**:\n   - Finally, take the square root of each element to obtain the Euclidean distances.\n\nThis method utilizes NumPy's efficient array operations, which are generally faster than explicit Python loops, especially for large arrays."
