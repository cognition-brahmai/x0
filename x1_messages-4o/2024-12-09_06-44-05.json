I've tried the following approach but I'm looking for a more Pythonic method. \n\n```\nmySet = set()\nmySet.add(myString)\n```\n\nThis approach works, however, when I try to create a set directly from the string, it creates a set of the letters in the string, not the string itself:\n\n```\nmySet = set(myString)\n```"

A set literal is defined using curly braces `{}` with the elements inside. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nmyString = \"yourString\"\nmySet = {myString}\n```\n\nThis will create a set containing just the one string `\"yourString\"` without splitting it into individual characters. This method is concise and clear, making it a preferred approach when you want to initialize a set with specific elements."
