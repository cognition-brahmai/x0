        "content": "In PHP, the `phpinfo()` function is a great way to get information about your PHP environment, including installed modules and extensions. If you're looking for a way to see what packages or modules are installed that you can import in PHP, you have a few options:\n\n1. **Composer**: If you're using Composer, the dependency manager for PHP, you can check your `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files. These files list all the packages you have installed through Composer. You can find information about these packages on Packagist, the default package repository for Composer.\n\n   - Run `composer show` in your project directory to list all installed Composer packages along with their versions and descriptions.\n\n2. **PHP Extensions**: For PHP extensions that are installed and enabled on your server, you can use functions like `get_loaded_extensions()` which returns an array of all the compiled and loaded extensions.\n\n   ```php\n   $extensions = get_loaded_extensions();\n   print_r($extensions);\n   ```\n\n   This will give you a list of extensions that are currently available in your PHP environment.\n\n3. **PHP Configuration Files**: You can also check the `php.ini` configuration file for extensions that are loaded. Look for lines starting with `extension=` to see which extensions are enabled.\n\n4. **Using CLI Tools**: If you have command-line access, you can also use `php -m` to list all compiled and loaded PHP modules.\n\nBy using these methods, you can get a comprehensive view of the PHP environment and the modules and packages available for you to use in your projects."
