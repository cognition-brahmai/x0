I have attempted several methods such as `model.optimizer.learning_rate.set_value(0.1)`, `model.optimizer.lr = 0.1`, `model.optimizer.learning_rate = 0.1`, `K.set_value(model.optimizer.learning_rate, 0.1)`, `K.set_value(model.optimizer.lr, 0.1)`, `model.optimizer.lr.assign(0.1)` but none of them seem to work. Here is the code I am working with: \n\n```python\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense\nimport keras\nimport numpy as np\n\nmodel = Sequential()\n\nmodel.add(Dense(1, input_shape=(10,)))\n\noptimizer = keras.optimizers.Adam(lr=0.01)\nmodel.compile(loss='mse',\n              optimizer=optimizer)\n\nmodel.fit(np.random.randn(50,10), np.random.randn(50), epochs=50)\n\n# Change learning rate to 0.001 and train for 50 more epochs\n\nmodel.fit(np.random.randn(50,10), np.random.randn(50), initial_epoch=50, epochs=50)\n```"

        "content": "To change the learning rate of your Keras model after it has been compiled, you need to adjust the learning rate of the optimizer directly. The issue you're facing might be related to how the learning rate is being set. Let's address it step-by-step.\n\nGiven the code snippet you've provided, you can modify the learning rate of the optimizer after the initial training by using TensorFlow's backend functions or directly modifying the optimizer's learning rate attribute. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Using TensorFlow's Backend Function\n\nIf you're using TensorFlow as the backend, you can use the `tf.keras.backend` to set the new learning rate:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Change learning rate to 0.001\ntf.keras.backend.set_value(model.optimizer.learning_rate, 0.001)\n\n# Train for 50 more epochs\nmodel.fit(np.random.randn(50,10), np.random.randn(50), initial_epoch=50, epochs=100)\n```\n\n### Direct Modification\n\nIn recent versions of TensorFlow/Keras, you can directly modify the optimizer's learning rate attribute:\n\n```python\n# Change learning rate to 0.001\nmodel.optimizer.learning_rate.assign(0.001)\n\n# Train for 50 more epochs\nmodel.fit(np.random.randn(50,10), np.random.randn(50), initial_epoch=50, epochs=100)\n```\n\n### Note\n\n- Ensure you are using a compatible version of TensorFlow/Keras where these methods are supported.\n- `initial_epoch=50` and `epochs=100` ensures continuity from the previous training session.\n\nWith these methods, you'll be able to effectively change the learning rate of your model after initial training."
