In Python, I'm creating a date and converting it to a timestamp as follows:\n\n```python\nd = date(2004, 01, 01)\nprint(d)  # Output: datetime.date(2004, 1, 1)\nprint(time.mktime(d.timetuple()))  # Output: 1072944000.0\n```\n\nHowever, when I use this timestamp to create a new date in JavaScript (data sent over Ajax), I'm getting a different date:\n\n```javascript\nnew Date(1072944000.0)  // Output: Tue Jan 13 1970 02:02:24 GMT-0800 (PST) {}\n```\n\nShouldn't the Javascript date be the same as the one that I entered in Python? What am I doing wrong?"

        "content": "The discrepancy you're experiencing is due to the difference in how Python and JavaScript handle timestamps. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Python Timestamps**:\n   - In Python, the `time.mktime()` function returns the timestamp in seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC), but it assumes the date is in the local timezone.\n\n2. **JavaScript Timestamps**:\n   - In JavaScript, the `Date` object constructor that takes a single number interprets that number as milliseconds since the Unix epoch, not seconds.\n\nIn your case, the Python timestamp `1072944000.0` represents seconds, but when you pass that directly to JavaScript's `Date` constructor, JavaScript interprets it as milliseconds. This results in a date that's drastically different from what you expect.\n\nTo fix this, you need to convert the Python timestamp from seconds to milliseconds before using it in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\n// Convert seconds to milliseconds by multiplying by 1000\nvar timestampInMilliseconds = 1072944000.0 * 1000;\nvar jsDate = new Date(timestampInMilliseconds);\n\nconsole.log(jsDate);  // Output: Thu Jan 01 2004 00:00:00 GMT-0800 (PST) {}\n```\n\nBy converting the seconds to milliseconds, the JavaScript `Date` object should now correctly reflect the original date you intended (January 1, 2004)."
