        "content": "To classify proteins as fibrous or globular based on their secondary structure using the given MATLAB code, you should first ensure that the criteria for classification are accurately defined according to the known characteristics of fibrous and globular proteins.\n\n1. **Fibrous Proteins**: These typically have long, extended structures and are primarily composed of repetitive sequences. They often have a high content of either alpha helices or beta sheets but not both. Examples include collagen and myosin.\n\n2. **Globular Proteins**: These are typically more compact, with a mix of alpha helices and beta sheets. Hemoglobin is a common example.\n\nBased on general protein knowledge:\n- **Hemoglobin**: This is a globular protein. It contains a mix of alpha helices and is compact, which fits the globular criteria.\n- **Collagen**: This is a fibrous protein, characterized by its triple helix structure and repetitive sequence.\n- **Myosin**: This is primarily considered a fibrous protein due to its structural role in muscle fibers, despite having globular heads (myosin heads).\n\nIn your MATLAB code:\n- Ensure that `secondaryStructure` correctly reflects the secondary structure elements for each protein.\n- Check that `fibrousCriteria` and `globularCriteria` are logically implemented based on actual structural data.\n- Inspect the classification output for each protein to confirm their categorization.\n\n### Possible Adjustments:\nThe criteria you set (`fibrousCriteria` and `globularCriteria`) might need adjustment based on specific structural thresholds relevant to your dataset. Additionally, verify that `alphaHelixCount` and `betaSheetCount` are being calculated correctly from `secondaryStructure`.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter running your code, you should see:\n- **Hemoglobin** should appear in `globularProteins`.\n- **Collagen and Myosin** should appear in `fibrousProteins`.\n\nIf the output does not match these expectations, review the criteria and ensure the data in `proteinStructureData` is accurate for the proteins in question."
