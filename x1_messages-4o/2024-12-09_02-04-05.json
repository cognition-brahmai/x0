Even though both functions seem to perform the same task, Python recognizes them as different entities. For instance, in the following code:\n\n```python\ndef a():\n    return 1\n\nb = lambda: 1\nprint(a)\nprint(b)\n```\n\nPython acknowledges that 'b' is a lambda function and 'a' is a regular function. Why does Python distinguish between them and what is the difference from Python's perspective?"

        "content": "In Python, both lambda functions and regular functions (defined with `def`) are used to define callable entities, but they have some differences in syntax, use cases, and capabilities:\n\n1. **Syntax**:\n   - **Lambda Function**: A lambda function is defined using the `lambda` keyword. It is a single-expression function that is typically used for short, throwaway functions. The syntax is `lambda arguments: expression`.\n   - **Regular Function**: A regular function is defined using the `def` keyword and can contain multiple expressions and statements within its body. The syntax is `def function_name(arguments):`.\n\n2. **Function Name**:\n   - **Lambda Function**: A lambda function is anonymous, meaning it does not have a name unless it is assigned to a variable. In the example, `b` is the variable that holds the lambda function.\n   - **Regular Function**: A regular function has a name, which is specified after the `def` keyword. In the example, `a` is the name of the regular function.\n\n3. **Use Cases**:\n   - **Lambda Function**: Best suited for simple operations that can be expressed in a single line and are used temporarily in the code, such as within functions like `map()`, `filter()`, or `sorted()`.\n   - **Regular Function**: Used for more complex operations that require multiple lines of code, including loops, multiple expressions, and detailed logic.\n\n4. **Readability and Documentation**:\n   - **Lambda Function**: Typically less readable, especially for complex operations, because they do not have a name or a docstring.\n   - **Regular Function**: More readable and maintainable, as they can have descriptive names and docstrings that explain their purpose and behavior.\n\n5. **Scope and Limitations**:\n   - **Lambda Function**: Cannot contain statements like `return`, `pass`, `assert`, or `raise`. It can only compute and return a single expression's value.\n   - **Regular Function**: Can contain multiple statements, including control flow statements, and can return values using the `return` keyword.\n\nIn your example code, when you print `a` and `b`, Python distinguishes between them because:\n- `a` is a name-bound regular function with a defined structure and potentially more complex capabilities.\n- `b` is a variable-bound lambda function with a simpler, single-purpose use case.\n\nDespite these differences, both lambda functions and regular functions are first-class objects in Python, meaning they can be passed around as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables."
