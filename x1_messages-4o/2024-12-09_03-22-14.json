One dataframe should contain all rows from `df` where the year equals a specified year (`some_year`), and the other dataframe should contain all rows where the year does not equal `some_year`. I understand that I can use `df.ix['2000-1-1' : '2001-1-1']` to get the rows for a specific year but this method seems to require creating two additional dataframes and then concatenating/joining them to get the rows not in the year 2000. Is there a more efficient way to achieve this? I tried the following code but it doesn't work. Is there any similar approach that will work?\n\n```python\ninclude = df[df.Date.year == year]\nexclude = df[df['Date'].year != year]\n```"

The `.year` attribute should be accessed using the `.dt` accessor when dealing with a pandas `Datetime` series. Here's how you can achieve your goal:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assume 'df' is your dataframe and 'some_year' is the year you're interested in\nsome_year = 2000\n\n# Ensure the 'Date' column is of datetime type\ndf['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])\n\n# Filter rows where the year equals some_year\ninclude = df[df['Date'].dt.year == some_year]\n\n# Filter rows where the year does not equal some_year\nexclude = df[df['Date'].dt.year != some_year]\n```\n\nThis code ensures that the 'Date' column is treated as a datetime object, allowing you to access the `.year` attribute appropriately using `.dt.year`. This should work efficiently without the need for additional dataframes or concatenation."
