        "content": "To implement your custom loss function in Keras, you'll need to use TensorFlow operations since Keras operates on tensors rather than simple scalar values or Python lists. The key is to use TensorFlow math operations to handle the logic you want to implement. Here's how you can complete your custom metric function:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras import backend as K\n\ndef custom_metric(y_true, y_pred):\n    # Calculate the absolute error percentage\n    aux = K.abs((y_true - y_pred) / y_pred)\n\n    # Initialize the errors tensor\n    errors = tf.zeros_like(aux)\n\n    # Apply the conditions using TensorFlow operations\n    condition1 = tf.less_equal(aux, 0.1)\n    condition2 = tf.logical_and(tf.greater(aux, 0.1), tf.less_equal(aux, 0.15))\n    condition3 = tf.logical_and(tf.greater(aux, 0.15), tf.less_equal(aux, 0.2))\n\n    # Use tf.where to apply the conditions\n    errors = tf.where(condition1, errors, errors + 0)\n    errors = tf.where(condition2, errors, errors + 5/3)\n    errors = tf.where(condition3, errors, errors + 5)\n    errors = tf.where(tf.logical_not(tf.logical_or(condition1, tf.logical_or(condition2, condition3))), errors, errors + 2000)\n\n    # Return the sum of errors\n    return K.sum(errors)\n\n# Example usage in model compilation\n# model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=custom_metric)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`aux` Calculation**: We calculate `aux` as the absolute difference between `y_true` and `y_pred` divided by `y_pred`.\n\n2. **Tensor Operations**: Instead of appending to a list, we use `tensorflow` operations to manipulate tensors directly. This is necessary because you want your function to work with tensors during the model training process.\n\n3. **Conditions**: We use `tf.less_equal`, `tf.greater`, and `tf.logical_and` to create boolean masks that correspond to each condition.\n\n4. **`tf.where`**: This function is used to apply the conditions and assign values to the `errors` tensor based on the conditions.\n\n5. **Return**: Finally, we sum up the `errors` tensor and return it, which will be used by Keras as a custom metric during model training.\n\nBy following this structure, your custom metric can be directly used in a Keras model compilation and training loop."
