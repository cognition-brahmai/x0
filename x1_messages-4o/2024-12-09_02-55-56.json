        "content": "Yes, the order of elements in the list is guaranteed in Python. Lists in Python are ordered collections, meaning that elements are stored in the order they are added. When you perform operations like `x = x + [1]`, `x = x + [2]`, and `x = x + [3]`, you are explicitly appending elements to the end of the list, maintaining the sequence in which you added them.\n\nTherefore, when you print `x`, the output will always be `[1, 2, 3]`, and the elements will not rearrange themselves unless you explicitly perform operations to change their order, such as sorting or reassigning elements in different positions."
