        "content": "Certainly! Let's break down the differences between Python decorators and the decorator design pattern, and explore when to use each with examples.\n\n### Python Decorators\n\nPython decorators are a feature within the language that allows you to modify or extend the behavior of functions or methods. They are applied using the `@decorator_name` syntax above a function definition. Python decorators are primarily used for cross-cutting concerns like logging, authentication, and timing without modifying the actual function code.\n\n**When to use Python decorators:**\n- To add functionality to a function or method without modifying its code.\n- When you need to apply the same logic to multiple functions (e.g., logging, access control).\n\n**Example of Python Decorator:**\n\n```python\ndef my_decorator(func):\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        print(\"Something is happening before the function is called.\")\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        print(\"Something is happening after the function is called.\")\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@my_decorator\ndef say_hello(name):\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n\nsay_hello(\"Alice\")\n```\n\n### Decorator Pattern\n\nThe decorator pattern is a structural design pattern used in object-oriented programming. It allows behavior to be added to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. It involves creating a set of decorator classes that are used to wrap concrete components.\n\n**When to use the decorator pattern:**\n- When you need to add responsibilities to objects dynamically and transparently.\n- When you want to extend the behavior of objects at runtime without modifying their code.\n\n**Example of Decorator Pattern:**\n\n```python\nclass Coffee:\n    def cost(self):\n        return 5\n\nclass MilkDecorator:\n    def __init__(self, coffee):\n        self._coffee = coffee\n\n    def cost(self):\n        return self._coffee.cost() + 1\n\nclass SugarDecorator:\n    def __init__(self, coffee):\n        self._coffee = coffee\n\n    def cost(self):\n        return self._coffee.cost() + 0.5\n\n# Usage\ncoffee = Coffee()\nprint(\"Plain Coffee:\", coffee.cost())\n\nmilk_coffee = MilkDecorator(coffee)\nprint(\"Milk Coffee:\", milk_coffee.cost())\n\nsugar_milk_coffee = SugarDecorator(milk_coffee)\nprint(\"Sugar Milk Coffee:\", sugar_milk_coffee.cost())\n```\n\n### Comparison\n\n- **Scope**: Python decorators are used at the function level, whereas the decorator pattern is used at the object level.\n- **Use case**: Python decorators are ideal for function-level concerns like logging, while the decorator pattern is suitable for adding features or responsibilities to objects dynamically.\n- **Implementation**: Python decorators use closures and the `@` syntax, while the decorator pattern uses class composition and inheritance.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUse Python decorators when you need to extend the functionality of functions or methods in a clean and reusable way. Use the decorator pattern when you need the flexibility to add or change the responsibilities of objects dynamically at runtime."
