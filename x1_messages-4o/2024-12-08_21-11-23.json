        "content": "Certainly! To find the country with the sixth-largest land area, you can create a Java program that reads the data, sorts it, and then retrieves the sixth-largest entry. Here's a simple way to accomplish this task:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class CountryLandArea {\n    static class Country {\n        String name;\n        int landArea;\n\n        Country(String name, int landArea) {\n            this.name = name;\n            this.landArea = landArea;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        List<Country> countries = new ArrayList<>();\n        \n        // Add countries and their land areas\n        countries.add(new Country(\"Russia\", 17098242));\n        countries.add(new Country(\"Canada\", 9984670));\n        countries.add(new Country(\"China\", 9596961));\n        countries.add(new Country(\"United States\", 9147593));\n        countries.add(new Country(\"Brazil\", 8515767));\n        countries.add(new Country(\"Australia\", 7692024));\n        countries.add(new Country(\"India\", 2973190));\n        countries.add(new Country(\"Argentina\", 2780400));\n        countries.add(new Country(\"Kazakhstan\", 2724900));\n        countries.add(new Country(\"Algeria\", 2381741));\n        countries.add(new Country(\"Democratic Congo\", 2344858));\n        countries.add(new Country(\"Greenland\", 2166086));\n        countries.add(new Country(\"Saudi Arabia\", 2149690));\n        countries.add(new Country(\"Mexico\", 1943945));\n        countries.add(new Country(\"Indonesia\", 1811570));\n\n        // Sort the list by land area in descending order\n        countries.sort((c1, c2) -> Integer.compare(c2.landArea, c1.landArea));\n\n        // Retrieve the country with the sixth-largest land area\n        if (countries.size() >= 6) {\n            Country sixthLargest = countries.get(5); // Index 5 is the sixth element\n            System.out.println(\"The country with the sixth-largest land area is: \" +\n                               sixthLargest.name + \" with \" + sixthLargest.landArea + \" sq km.\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"There are less than 6 countries in the list.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Country Class**: A simple class to hold the name and land area of each country.\n2. **List Initialization**: A list of `Country` objects is created and initialized with the given countries and their respective land areas.\n3. **Sorting**: The list is sorted in descending order based on the land area using a lambda expression.\n4. **Retrieval**: The country at index 5 is retrieved, as list indices are zero-based, and this corresponds to the sixth-largest land area.\n\nThis program will output the country with the sixth-largest land area when run."
