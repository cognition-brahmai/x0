I am seeking for the best algorithm to solve this problem, and if possible, could the solution be provided in Python?"

        "content": "To find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in a given sequence, you can use dynamic programming with binary search to achieve an efficient solution. This approach runs in \\(O(n \\log n)\\) time complexity, which is suitable for larger input sizes.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide and the corresponding Python implementation:\n\n### Approach:\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming with Binary Search:** \n   - Use a list `dp` to store the smallest ending value of an increasing subsequence of each possible length.\n   - Iterate over each element in the input sequence and use binary search to determine the position in `dp` where the current element should be placed.\n   - If the element is larger than all elements in `dp`, append it to extend the largest subsequence found.\n   - If it can replace an element in `dp`, replace the first element in `dp` that is greater than or equal to it, maintaining the smallest possible values for the subsequences.\n\n2. **Binary Search:** \n   - Use the `bisect` module in Python to perform binary search operations efficiently.\n\nHere's how you can implement this solution in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom bisect import bisect_left\n\ndef longest_increasing_subsequence(sequence):\n    if not sequence:\n        return 0\n\n    # `dp` will store the smallest ending value of an increasing subsequence of each possible length\n    dp = []\n\n    for num in sequence:\n        # Find the index of the smallest number in `dp` that is greater than or equal to `num`\n        pos = bisect_left(dp, num)\n\n        # If `num` is greater than all elements in `dp`, append it\n        if pos == len(dp):\n            dp.append(num)\n        else:\n            # Otherwise, replace the first element in `dp` that is greater than or equal to `num`\n            dp[pos] = num\n\n    # The length of `dp` is the length of the longest increasing subsequence\n    return len(dp)\n\n# Example usage\nsequence = [0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15]\nlength_of_lis = longest_increasing_subsequence(sequence)\nprint(\"Length of Longest Increasing Subsequence:\", length_of_lis)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`dp` List:** Each element in `dp` represents the smallest possible ending value of an increasing subsequence of length equal to the index + 1.\n  \n- **`bisect_left`:** This function finds the position where the current number can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order of the `dp`.\n\n- **Updating `dp`:** If `pos` is equal to the length of `dp`, the current number is greater than all elements in `dp`, so it's appended. Otherwise, it replaces the current element at `pos` to maintain the smallest possible ending values.\n\nThis solution effectively constructs the longest increasing subsequence by ensuring that potential subsequences are kept minimal, allowing room for longer subsequences as the algorithm proceeds."
