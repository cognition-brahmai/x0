I have a datetime object as shown below:\n\n```python\n>>> a = str(datetime.now())\n>>> a\n'2012-03-22 11:16:11.343000'\n```\n\nI would like to get a string in the format '16:11.34'. Is there a compact way to achieve this? Or should I use the time() function? How could I implement this?"

        "content": "To extract the minutes, seconds, and milliseconds from a `datetime` object and format them as a string in the format `'MM:SS.ms'`, you can use the `strftime` method along with string slicing for the milliseconds. Here's how you can achieve this in a compact way:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Get the current datetime\na = datetime.now()\n\n# Format the datetime to 'MM:SS.ms'\nformatted_time = a.strftime('%M:%S.') + str(a.microsecond)[:2]\n\nprint(formatted_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `strftime('%M:%S.')` is used to format the minutes and seconds.\n- `str(a.microsecond)[:2]` extracts the first two digits of the microseconds to represent the milliseconds. We use slicing to get only the first two digits to match your desired format of milliseconds.\n\nThis method captures the required format in a compact and efficient manner without needing to convert the `datetime` object into a string and manipulating it manually."
