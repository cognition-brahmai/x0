I need a Python library that can generate public and private PGP keys and also decrypt files encrypted with the public key. I have looked into pyCrypto and GNUPG but their documentation is unclear. Also, I found that GNUPG does stuff to the registry and throws dll's everywhere in Windows, leading to potential issues with user's existing installations. I've also considered pyME, but it appears incompatible with Python 2.4 which I'm using. Can you suggest a Python library or a standalone command-line tool that can solve my problem?"

        "content": "For your requirements, you might consider using the `PGPy` library, which is a Python library for working with PGP keys and messages. It is designed to be simple to use and does not have the same system-level dependencies or side effects as GNUPG, making it a good choice for a clean and portable solution.\n\nUnfortunately, `PGPy` does not support Python 2.4 directly since it's quite an old version, and most modern libraries have dropped support for it. However, if you can upgrade to a more recent version of Python, `PGPy` can handle key generation, encryption, and decryption. Here's a simple example to get you started:\n\n1. **Installation**: You can install `PGPy` using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install PGPy\n   ```\n\n2. **Key Generation**:\n   ```python\n   from PGPy import PGPKey, PGPUID\n   from PGPy.constants import PubKeyAlgorithm, KeyFlags, HashAlgorithm, SymmetricKeyAlgorithm, CompressionAlgorithm\n\n   # Generate a new RSA key pair\n   key = PGPKey.new(PubKeyAlgorithm.RSAEncryptOrSign, 2048)\n   uid = PGPUID.new('User Name', email='user@example.com')\n\n   # Add the new user id to the key and set usage preferences\n   key.add_uid(uid, usage={KeyFlags.Sign, KeyFlags.EncryptCommunications, KeyFlags.EncryptStorage},\n               hashes=[HashAlgorithm.SHA256],\n               ciphers=[SymmetricKeyAlgorithm.AES256],\n               compression=[CompressionAlgorithm.ZLIB])\n\n   # Export the keys\n   private_key = key.export()  # Export the private key\n   public_key = key.pubkey.export()  # Export the public key\n   ```\n\n3. **Encrypting a File**:\n   ```python\n   from PGPy import PGPMessage\n\n   # Load the public key\n   pubkey, _ = PGPKey.from_blob(public_key)\n\n   # Encrypt a message\n   message = PGPMessage.new('This is a secret message')\n   encrypted_message = pubkey.encrypt(message)\n\n   # Save the encrypted message to a file\n   with open('encrypted_file.pgp', 'w') as f:\n       f.write(str(encrypted_message))\n   ```\n\n4. **Decrypting a File**:\n   ```python\n   # Load the private key\n   privkey, _ = PGPKey.from_blob(private_key)\n\n   # Load the encrypted message\n   with open('encrypted_file.pgp', 'r') as f:\n       encrypted_message = PGPMessage.from_blob(f.read())\n\n   # Decrypt the message\n   with privkey.unlock('your_passphrase'):  # Use the passphrase you set for the key\n       decrypted_message = privkey.decrypt(encrypted_message)\n\n   print(decrypted_message.message)\n   ```\n\nIf upgrading Python is not an option, you might need to consider using a standalone tool like Gpg4win or a similar command-line tool that can be invoked from Python using subprocess calls. This way, you can handle encryption and decryption externally without worrying about Python version compatibility.\n\nRemember to always keep your private key secure and never expose it in your code or repositories."
