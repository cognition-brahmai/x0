        "content": "Yes, Python has several ways to achieve similar functionality to PHP's `var_dump()`. While Python does not have a direct equivalent, you can use the following functions to inspect variables and their contents:\n\n1. **`print()`**: For basic debugging, you can simply use the `print()` function to display the value of a variable.\n\n   ```python\n   my_variable = {'key': 'value', 'another_key': [1, 2, 3]}\n   print(my_variable)\n   ```\n\n2. **`type()`**: To check the type of a variable, you can use `type()`.\n\n   ```python\n   my_variable = 42\n   print(type(my_variable))  # Output: <class 'int'>\n   ```\n\n3. **`repr()`**: For a more detailed string representation of an object, especially useful for strings and objects.\n\n   ```python\n   my_string = \"Hello, World!\"\n   print(repr(my_string))  # Output: 'Hello, World!'\n   ```\n\n4. **`pprint` module**: The `pprint` (pretty-print) module can be used for more complex data structures, making them easier to read.\n\n   ```python\n   import pprint\n\n   my_variable = {'key': 'value', 'another_key': [1, 2, 3]}\n   pprint.pprint(my_variable)\n   ```\n\n5. **`dir()`**: To list the attributes and methods of an object.\n\n   ```python\n   my_variable = [1, 2, 3]\n   print(dir(my_variable))\n   ```\n\n6. **`vars()`**: If you want to return the `__dict__` attribute of an object, which contains its writable attributes.\n\n   ```python\n   class MyClass:\n       def __init__(self):\n           self.attribute = \"value\"\n\n   obj = MyClass()\n   print(vars(obj))  # Output: {'attribute': 'value'}\n   ```\n\nThese tools collectively provide robust options for inspecting variables and debugging in Python, similar to what `var_dump()` does in PHP."
