        "content": "I have a CSV file without a header, which contains a DateTime index. I am trying to rename the index and column name in my pandas DataFrame using `df.rename()`. However, it seems like only the column name is getting renamed and the index remains the same. Is this a bug? I am currently using version 0.12.0 of pandas. Here is my current code and output:\n\n```python\ndf = pd.read_csv(r'D:\\Data\\DataTimeSeries_csv//seriesSM.csv', header=None, parse_dates=[[0]], index_col=[0] )\n\ndf.head()\n# Output: \n#                    1\n# 0                   \n# 2002-06-18  0.112000\n# 2002-06-22  0.190333\n# 2002-06-26  0.134000\n# 2002-06-30  0.093000\n# 2002-07-04  0.098667\n\ndf.rename(index={0:'Date'}, columns={1:'SM'}, inplace=True)\n\ndf.head()\n# Output: \n#                   SM\n# 0                   \n# 2002-06-18  0.112000\n# 2002-06-22  0.190333\n# 2002-06-26  0.134000\n# 2002-06-30  0.093000\n# 2002-07-04  0.098667\n```"

        "content": "It looks like you're trying to rename the index of your DataFrame, but the approach you're using is not effective because `df.rename()` with the `index` parameter is used for renaming specific index values rather than the index name itself. In your case, since the index is a DateTime index, you might want to set a name for it directly.\n\nHere's how you can rename the index and the column properly:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming the CSV reading part is correct\ndf = pd.read_csv(r'D:\\Data\\DataTimeSeries_csv//seriesSM.csv', header=None, parse_dates=[[0]], index_col=[0])\n\n# Rename the column\ndf.columns = ['SM']\n\n# Set the index name\ndf.index.name = 'Date'\n\n# Display the DataFrame\nprint(df.head())\n```\n\nThis code will set the column name to 'SM' and the index name to 'Date', which should give you the desired output. The `df.columns` attribute is used to set the column names, and `df.index.name` is used to set the name of the index."
