It enables developers to style HTML elements, including colors, fonts, and spacing, to create visually appealing content.\n\n3. **JavaScript:** JavaScript is a scripting language used to create interactive and dynamic elements on web pages. It allows for the implementation of features such as animations, form validation, and content updates without reloading the page.\n\nTogether, these technologies enable the creation of modern, interactive websites and applications."
