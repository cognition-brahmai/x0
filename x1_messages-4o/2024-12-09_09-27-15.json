        "content": "To find the most frequent number in an array of integers using Python, you can make use of the `collections` module, specifically the `Counter` class, which makes this task straightforward. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef find_most_frequent_number(arr):\n    # Create a Counter object from the array\n    count = Counter(arr)\n    \n    # Find the number with the highest frequency\n    most_frequent = count.most_common(1)[0][0]\n    \n    return most_frequent\n\n# Example usage:\narray = [1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1]\nmost_frequent_number = find_most_frequent_number(array)\nprint(f\"The most frequent number is: {most_frequent_number}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Import `Counter`:** The `Counter` class from the `collections` module will help count the occurrences of each element in the array.\n\n2. **Create a Counter object:** This object will store elements of the array as keys and their counts as values.\n\n3. **Use `most_common()`:** This method returns a list of the n most common elements and their counts from the most common to the least. `most_common(1)` will return the most frequent element.\n\n4. **Extract the element:** Access the first element of the tuple to get the most frequent number.\n\nThis approach is efficient and concise, making it suitable for handling large arrays."
