I am not looking for testing frameworks like Selenium or Windmill as they launch instances of browsers. Instead, I need a script that I can schedule to run daily to retrieve the page I want, log into a 3rd party website programmatically, then download and parse a file for insertion into our database. Is there a way to do this?"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this using a combination of Python libraries that allow you to interact with web pages programmatically without launching a browser. One popular library for such tasks is `Requests` for sending HTTP requests, and `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML. However, for interacting with forms and simulating button clicks, you can use `requests-html` or `mechanize`. Here's a general approach using `requests-html`:\n\n1. **Install Required Libraries**:\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests-html\n   ```\n\n2. **Script to Submit Form and Download File**:\n   Here's a basic example of how you can fill out a form and submit it using `requests-html`:\n\n   ```python\n   from requests_html import HTMLSession\n\n   # Start a session\n   session = HTMLSession()\n\n   # Load the webpage\n   url = 'https://example.com/login'  # Replace with the target URL\n   response = session.get(url)\n\n   # Parse the form fields\n   response.html.render()  # Render JavaScript if necessary\n   form = response.html.find('form', first=True)  # Find the form\n\n   # Prepare form data (adjust the field names based on the form)\n   form_data = {\n       'username': 'your_username',\n       'password': 'your_password',\n       # Add other form fields as necessary\n   }\n\n   # Submit the form\n   submit_url = form.attrs['action']\n   submit_response = session.post(submit_url, data=form_data)\n\n   # Check if login was successful\n   if \"Welcome\" in submit_response.text:  # Adjust the condition based on the success message\n       print(\"Login successful!\")\n\n       # If needed, navigate to the page with the file\n       file_page_url = 'https://example.com/file-page'  # Replace with the actual file page URL\n       file_page_response = session.get(file_page_url)\n\n       # Find the file link and download it\n       file_link = file_page_response.html.find('a#download-link', first=True).attrs['href']\n       file_response = session.get(file_link)\n\n       # Save the file\n       with open('downloaded_file.ext', 'wb') as file:\n           file.write(file_response.content)\n       print(\"File downloaded successfully!\")\n   else:\n       print(\"Login failed.\")\n\n   session.close()\n   ```\n\n3. **Considerations**:\n   - **JavaScript-Heavy Websites**: If the website relies heavily on JavaScript for rendering content or forms, `requests-html` includes the ability to render JavaScript with its `render()` method, but it may not be as robust as a full browser engine.\n   - **Cookies and Sessions**: Ensure that you handle cookies and session management properly, especially if the website uses session-based authentication.\n   - **CSRF Tokens**: Many forms include CSRF tokens. You may need to extract and include these in your form submission.\n   - **Legal and Ethical**: Make sure you have permission to access and interact with the website programmatically, and comply with its terms of service.\n\nThis approach should allow you to automate the form submission and file download without launching a browser, and you can schedule the script to run daily using a task scheduler like `cron` on Unix or `Task Scheduler` on Windows."
