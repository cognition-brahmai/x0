The image displays correctly, but when saved, it has white space around it. I've tried using the 'tight' option with the savefig method, but it doesn't seem to work. Here is the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.image as mpimg\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nfig = plt.figure(1)\nimg = mpimg.imread(\"image.jpg\")\nplt.imshow(img)\nax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1)\n\nextent = ax.get_window_extent().transformed(fig.dpi_scale_trans.inverted())\nplt.savefig('1.png', bbox_inches=extent)\n\nplt.axis('off') \nplt.show()\n```\n\nI'm also trying to draw a basic graph using NetworkX on this image and save it. I've noticed that without the graph, it works fine, but when I add a graph, I get white space around the saved image:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.image as mpimg\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport networkx as nx\n\nG = nx.Graph()\nG.add_node(1)\nG.add_node(2)\nG.add_node(3)\nG.add_edge(1, 3)\nG.add_edge(1, 2)\npos = {1:[100, 120], 2:[200, 300], 3:[50, 75]}\n\nfig = plt.figure(1)\nimg = mpimg.imread(\"image.jpg\")\nplt.imshow(img)\nax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1)\n\nnx.draw(G, pos=pos)\n\nextent = ax.get_window_extent().transformed(fig.dpi_scale_trans.inverted())\nplt.savefig('1.png', bbox_inches=extent)\n\nplt.axis('off') \nplt.show()\n```"

        "content": "To remove the white space around a saved image when using Matplotlib, especially when overlaying plots or drawings like a NetworkX graph, you should use the `bbox_inches='tight'` option correctly and ensure that all elements are managed properly. Additionally, you might want to adjust the figure's layout to remove any additional padding or margins.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can address the white space issue in your code:\n\n1. Make sure that `plt.axis('off')` is called before saving the figure to ensure that the axes are not included in the saved output.\n2. Ensure that the figure size and DPI are set appropriately to match the dimensions of the image and the resolution you desire.\n3. Use `bbox_inches='tight'` directly in the `savefig` call.\n\nBelow is an updated version of your code that includes these suggestions:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.image as mpimg\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport networkx as nx\n\n# Load the image\nimg = mpimg.imread(\"image.jpg\")\n\n# Create the figure and axis\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# Display the image\nax.imshow(img)\n\n# Turn off the axis\nplt.axis('off')\n\n# Create the graph\nG = nx.Graph()\nG.add_node(1)\nG.add_node(2)\nG.add_node(3)\nG.add_edge(1, 3)\nG.add_edge(1, 2)\npos = {1: [100, 120], 2: [200, 300], 3: [50, 75]}\n\n# Draw the graph on top of the image\nnx.draw(G, pos=pos, ax=ax)\n\n# Save the figure with tight bounding box\nplt.savefig('1.png', bbox_inches='tight', pad_inches=0)\n\n# Display the image with the graph\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **`plt.axis('off')`**: This ensures that axis ticks, labels, and the frame are not included in the output.\n- **`bbox_inches='tight'`**: This option tells Matplotlib to only include the actual content in the saved file, minimizing any white space.\n- **`pad_inches=0`**: Reduces padding around the saved image to zero.\n\nMake sure the `pos` dictionary has coordinates that fit well within the dimensions of the image to ensure that the nodes and edges are drawn where you expect them. Adjust the `pos` values if necessary to fit your specific image size and resolution."
