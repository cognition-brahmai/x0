I have two functions, one using `typing.Dict` and the other using `dict` for the same purpose. Both functions seem to work fine without any noticeable difference. Which one should I use in my program?\n\nCode:\n\n```python\nimport typing\n\ndef change_bandwidths(new_bandwidths: typing.Dict,\n                      user_id: int,\n                      user_name: str) -> bool:\n    print(new_bandwidths, user_id, user_name)\n    return False\n\ndef my_change_bandwidths(new_bandwidths: dict,\n                         user_id: int,\n                         user_name: str) ->bool:\n    print(new_bandwidths, user_id, user_name)\n    return True\n\ndef main():\n    my_id, my_name = 23, \"Tiras\"\n    simple_dict = {\"Hello\": \"Moon\"}\n    change_bandwidths(simple_dict, my_id, my_name)\n    new_dict = {\"new\": \"energy source\"}\n    my_change_bandwidths(new_dict, my_id, my_name)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"

        "content": "In Python 3.5, `typing.Dict` and `dict` serve similar purposes when it comes to type hinting, but they have some differences in terms of how they are used and what they convey.\n\n1. **`typing.Dict`**:\n   - `typing.Dict` is used to specify the types of keys and values in a dictionary. For example, `typing.Dict[str, int]` indicates a dictionary with string keys and integer values.\n   - It is part of the `typing` module, which is specifically designed to provide support for type hints and generic types.\n   - It provides better readability and explicitness when you want to communicate the expected types of keys and values.\n\n2. **`dict`**:\n   - Using `dict` for type hinting in function signatures is more concise but less specific. It indicates that the parameter should be a dictionary, but it doesn't specify the types of keys and values.\n   - It is more minimalistic and may be preferred for simple cases where the specific types of keys and values are not crucial.\n\nIn the context of your code, if you want to specify that `new_bandwidths` is expected to be a dictionary with specific types of keys and values, you should use `typing.Dict` and specify these types. For example:\n\n```python\ndef change_bandwidths(new_bandwidths: typing.Dict[str, int],\n                      user_id: int,\n                      user_name: str) -> bool:\n    ...\n```\n\nIf the specific types of keys and values are not important for your use case, using `dict` is fine. It is also more concise:\n\n```python\ndef my_change_bandwidths(new_bandwidths: dict,\n                         user_id: int,\n                         user_name: str) -> bool:\n    ...\n```\n\nIn short, if you want to provide more detailed information about the expected dictionary content, use `typing.Dict` with specified key-value types. If you prefer simplicity and the specific types are not a concern, `dict` is sufficient."
