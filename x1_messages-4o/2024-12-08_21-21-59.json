        "content": "Certainly! Let's break down the tasks one by one.\n\n### Ruby Code for Negative Form in Present Perfect Tense\n\nHere's a simple Ruby code snippet that converts a given sentence in the present perfect tense to its negative form for the third-person singular:\n\n```ruby\ndef negate_present_perfect_third_person(sentence)\n  # Split the sentence into words\n  words = sentence.split\n  \n  # Identify the present perfect structure\n  if words[0].downcase == 'he' || words[0].downcase == 'she' || words[0].downcase == 'it'\n    if words[1].downcase == 'has'\n      # Convert to negative form\n      words[1] = \"hasn't\"\n    end\n  end\n  \n  # Join the words back into a sentence\n  negative_sentence = words.join(\" \")\n  return negative_sentence\nend\n\n# Example usage\nsentence = \"He has eaten breakfast.\"\nnegative_sentence = negate_present_perfect_third_person(sentence)\nputs negative_sentence  # Output: \"He hasn't eaten breakfast.\"\n```\n\n### Explanation of Present Perfect Tense\n\nThe present perfect tense is used to describe an action that occurred at an unspecified time in the past and is relevant to the present. It is formed using the auxiliary verb \"has\" or \"have\" followed by the past participle of the main verb.\n\n#### Example:\n- **Affirmative:** \"He has eaten breakfast.\" (The action of eating breakfast happened at some point before now.)\n- **Negative:** \"He hasn't eaten breakfast.\" (The action of eating breakfast has not happened up to now.)\n\n### Multi-step Logical Puzzle\n\nLet's construct a puzzle where the answer is a European city known for its cultural heritage, located on a river flowing through three countries, and is the capital of a country with a bicameral legislature.\n\n#### Puzzle:\n\n1. I am thinking of a city in Europe known for its rich cultural and historical significance.\n2. This city is situated on the banks of a river that flows through three countries: Germany, Austria, and Slovakia.\n3. This city is the capital of a country that has a bicameral legislature, consisting of two houses.\n4. The river mentioned is famously called \"the Danube.\"\n\n#### Answer:\n\nThe city you are looking for is **Vienna**. \n\n- Vienna is the capital of Austria, a country with a bicameral legislature (consisting of the National Council and the Federal Council).\n- The Danube River flows through Germany, Austria, and Slovakia.\n- Vienna is renowned for its rich cultural heritage, including music, art, and architecture."
