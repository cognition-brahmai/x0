My assumption was that if I pass an array to the argmin function like np.argmin([5, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1]), it would return all the indices of the minimum value, which in this case should be [3, 4, 5, 7]. However, it only returns 3. Could anyone explain why this is happening and how can I modify it to get the expected result?"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is because the `np.argmin` function is designed to return the index of the first occurrence of the minimum value in the array, not all occurrences. That's why it returns 3 in your example, which is the index of the first minimum value (1).\n\nTo get all the indices of the minimum value, you can use the `np.where` function in combination with `np.min`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\narray = np.array([5, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1])\nmin_value = np.min(array)\nmin_indices = np.where(array == min_value)[0]\n\nprint(min_indices)\n```\n\nThis code snippet will output:\n\n```\n[3 4 5 7]\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's happening:\n- `np.min(array)` finds the minimum value in the array.\n- `np.where(array == min_value)` returns a tuple of arrays, where each array contains indices of elements that satisfy the condition (`array == min_value`). We use `[0]` to get the first array from the tuple, which contains the indices of the minimum value."
