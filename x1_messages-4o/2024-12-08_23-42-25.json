        "content": "Certainly! To modify the function so that it only calculates the sum of even numbers in the array, you can include a conditional check within the loop to determine if a number is even before adding it to the sum. Here's the modified function:\n\n```swift\nfunc sumEvenNumbers(arr: [Int]) -> Int {\n    var sum = 0\n    for num in arr {\n        if num % 2 == 0 {\n            sum += num\n        }\n    }\n    return sum\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We introduce an `if` statement inside the `for` loop to check if `num` is even.\n- The condition `num % 2 == 0` checks if the number is divisible by 2 with no remainder, indicating that it's even.\n- Only if the condition is true, the number is added to `sum`.\n\n### How to Use This Function in a Swift Program:\n\nYou can incorporate this function into a Swift program by calling it with an array of integers. For example:\n\n```swift\nlet numbers = [3, 5, 2, 7, 8, 10, 9, 4]\nlet evenSum = sumEvenNumbers(arr: numbers)\nprint(\"The sum of even numbers in the array is \\(evenSum).\")\n```\n\n### Explanation of Usage:\n- We define an array `numbers` containing integers.\n- We call `sumEvenNumbers` with this array to compute the sum of all even numbers.\n- Finally, we print the result. In this case, the output would be \"The sum of even numbers in the array is 24,\" since the even numbers are 2, 8, 10, and 4, and their sum is 24."
