I have noticed that OpenCV 2.4.x documentation is based on Sphinx, which offers a hierarchical structure of modules, the ability to add images and mathematical formulas, and a good embedded search engine. However, I've also discovered that the C++ version of OpenCV 3.0 is documented based on Doxygen. I am aware that Doxygen can compile code and extract comments, and that libraries like 'breathe' can act as a bridge between Doxygen and Sphinx. My questions are: \n1) Are Sphinx and Doxygen alternatives to each other or can they be used alongside each other? \n2) Does Doxygen possess the mentioned features of Sphinx? \n3) Which documentation engine (Sphinx, Doxygen, or others) would you recommend for my situation?"

        "content": "When documenting a collection of projects, modules, and libraries in the field of computer vision, it's important to choose the right documentation tools that suit your requirements and workflow. Let's address your questions:\n\n1. **Are Sphinx and Doxygen alternatives to each other or can they be used alongside each other?**\n\n   Sphinx and Doxygen are not strictly alternatives; they can indeed be used together, as they serve slightly different purposes. Doxygen is primarily focused on generating documentation from annotated code comments, which is particularly useful for API documentation. On the other hand, Sphinx is a documentation generator that is highly flexible and widely used for creating rich, narrative-style documentation, such as manuals and guides. With tools like 'breathe', you can integrate Doxygen-generated XML output into Sphinx, allowing you to leverage the strengths of both tools.\n\n2. **Does Doxygen possess the mentioned features of Sphinx?**\n\n   Doxygen does provide some features similar to Sphinx, such as the ability to include images and formulas (using LaTeX for mathematical expressions). However, Sphinx excels in its ability to create complex, structured documents with rich formatting, cross-references, and an advanced search engine. It is particularly well-suited for writing comprehensive guides and manuals, whereas Doxygen is more focused on extracting and formatting code documentation.\n\n3. **Which documentation engine (Sphinx, Doxygen, or others) would you recommend for my situation?**\n\n   Given your scenario, where you are documenting projects, modules, and libraries primarily in C++, and considering the structured and narrative nature of the documentation you desire, a combination of Doxygen and Sphinx might be ideal. This approach allows you to:\n\n   - Use Doxygen for generating API documentation directly from your C++ code comments.\n   - Use Sphinx to create more extensive narrative documentation, tutorials, and guides.\n   - Utilize 'breathe' to integrate Doxygen-generated content into Sphinx, providing a cohesive documentation experience.\n\n   This setup offers the best of both worlds: automated extraction of code comments and the ability to craft detailed documentation with Sphinx's powerful features. Additionally, if you are looking for alternatives, you might consider tools like MkDocs for markdown-based documentation or Javadoc for Java projects, but for C++ and the requirements you've outlined, the combination of Doxygen and Sphinx is highly recommended."
