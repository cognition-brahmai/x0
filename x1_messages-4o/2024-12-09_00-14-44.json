This is usually located at `path_to_your_virtualenv/bin/python` on Ubuntu.\n   - Select the Python executable and apply the changes.\n\n3. **Configure Django Support**:\n   - Go to `File` > `Settings` or press `Ctrl + Alt + S`.\n   - In the settings window, navigate to `Languages & Frameworks` > `Django`.\n   - Check the box `Enable Django Support`.\n   - Specify the `Django project root` if not automatically detected.\n   - Set the `Settings` file by browsing to your Django project's settings file, typically `your_project/settings.py`.\n   - Apply the changes.\n\n4. **Synchronize Libraries**:\n   - IntelliJ IDEA should automatically index and recognize the libraries from your virtual environment.\n   - If necessary, you can manually refresh the project by clicking on the `Refresh` button in the Project tool window.\n\n5. **Verify Configuration**:\n   - Ensure that IntelliJ IDEA recognizes the libraries by trying to import a library from your virtual environment in a Python file.\n   - If the imports are recognized without any errors, your configuration is successful.\n\nBy completing these steps, IntelliJ IDEA should be set up to use the libraries from your virtual environment effectively. This setup allows you to leverage the full features of IntelliJ IDEA while working seamlessly within your virtual environment."
