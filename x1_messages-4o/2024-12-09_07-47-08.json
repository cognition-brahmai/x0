Could you explain why this is suggested? I understand that the Pipfile.lock file will store the specific versions and hashes of the dependencies I install, but don't I want to be able to see the specific versions of what is installed in the Pipfile, similar to the way I do when I use a requirements.txt?"

        "content": "The recommendation to avoid pinning version numbers in a Pipfile is rooted in the desire to maintain flexibility and ensure smoother dependency management. Here\u2019s why this approach is suggested:\n\n1. **Flexibility and Compatibility**: By not pinning specific versions in the Pipfile, you allow pipenv to resolve and install the most recent compatible versions of packages. This helps in getting the latest features, improvements, or security patches without manual intervention.\n\n2. **Separation of Concerns**: The Pipfile is meant to declare the dependencies your project needs, while the Pipfile.lock is designed to lock down the specific versions that were installed at a given time. This separation ensures that while your Pipfile specifies the general requirements (e.g., major or minor versions), the Pipfile.lock captures the exact versions used to ensure reproducibility.\n\n3. **Ease of Updates**: When you don\u2019t pin exact versions, you can more easily update your dependencies. Running `pipenv update` will automatically fetch the latest compatible versions of your dependencies and update your Pipfile.lock, simplifying the process of keeping your project up-to-date.\n\n4. **Avoiding Dependency Conflicts**: Pinning specific versions in the Pipfile could lead to conflicts if other dependencies have overlapping requirements. Allowing pipenv to manage versions helps in finding a compatible set of dependencies that work together without conflicts.\n\n5. **Reproducibility**: The Pipfile.lock ensures that the exact versions used in your development environment are recorded. This file is what you should commit to version control to ensure that others working on the project, or deployment environments, use the exact same versions.\n\nIn summary, by not pinning versions in the Pipfile, you maintain a more flexible and adaptable dependency management setup. The Pipfile allows you to specify broad compatibility, while the Pipfile.lock ensures reproducibility by capturing exact versions. This dual approach is intended to balance flexibility in development with stability in deployment."
