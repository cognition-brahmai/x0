However, the response is not streaming as expected. I suspect there's a middleware interfering with it, possibly the ETAG calculator. How do I disable it? The code I have so far is:\n\n```python\ndef stream_response(request):\n    resp = HttpResponse( stream_response_generator())\n    return resp\n\ndef stream_response_generator():\n    for x in range(1,11):\n        yield \"%s\\n\" % x  # Returns a chunk of the response to the browser\n        time.sleep(1)\n```"

        "content": "Streaming an `HttpResponse` in Django can be a bit tricky due to middleware or settings that might buffer the response. Since you are using Django 1.2, there may be middleware such as `CommonMiddleware` that could be interfering with streaming by calculating ETags or other operations that assume the response is fully prepared before being sent.\n\nTo stream the response properly, you can try the following steps and code adjustments:\n\n1. **Disable Middleware**: Start by disabling any middleware that might interfere with streaming. Specifically, look at `CommonMiddleware` and any custom middleware that might alter the response.\n\n2. **Adjust the View Code**: Use `StreamingHttpResponse` instead of `HttpResponse` to explicitly indicate that this response will be streamed. Note that `StreamingHttpResponse` was introduced in Django 1.5, so this solution would not apply directly to Django 1.2. For Django 1.2, you might need to handle streaming differently or upgrade to a version that supports `StreamingHttpResponse`.\n\n3. **Disable ETag Calculation**: If you suspect ETag calculation is the issue, you need to disable it. You can do this by setting the `USE_ETAGS` setting to `False` in your settings file.\n\nHere's an example of how you might adjust your streaming response code for a newer Django version that supports `StreamingHttpResponse`:\n\n```python\nfrom django.http import StreamingHttpResponse\nimport time\n\ndef stream_response(request):\n    response = StreamingHttpResponse(stream_response_generator(), content_type='text/plain')\n    response['Cache-Control'] = 'no-cache'  # Ensure the response isn't cached\n    return response\n\ndef stream_response_generator():\n    for x in range(1, 11):\n        yield f\"{x}\\n\"\n        time.sleep(1)\n```\n\nIf you are working with Django 1.2 and cannot upgrade, consider the following alternative approach:\n\n- **Flushing the Response**: You can try manually flushing the response. However, Django 1.2 does not provide built-in support for this, so you might need to interact more directly with the underlying WSGI server or client connection.\n\n- **Upgrade Django**: If possible, upgrade to a more recent version of Django that natively supports streaming responses with `StreamingHttpResponse`.\n\nFinally, ensure that your server configuration (such as Apache or Nginx) is set up to handle streaming responses appropriately, as server settings can also affect response behavior."
