Can you provide a Ruby code that randomly selects three activities from a list?\nHere's an example code:\nactivities = [\"Read a book\", \"Take a walk outside\", \"Cook a new recipe\", \"Listen to music\", \"Watch a movie\", \"Call a friend\", \"Try a new hobby\"]\nrandom_activities = activities.sample(3)\nputs \"Here are three activities to do when you're feeling bored:\"\nrandom_activities.each do |activity|\n  puts \"- #{activity}\"\nend"

        "content": "Certainly! The Ruby code you've provided is a great example of how to randomly select activities from a list. Here's a slightly expanded version of your code, with additional activities added to the list for more variety:\n\n```ruby\nactivities = [\n  \"Read a book\",\n  \"Take a walk outside\",\n  \"Cook a new recipe\",\n  \"Listen to music\",\n  \"Watch a movie\",\n  \"Call a friend\",\n  \"Try a new hobby\",\n  \"Do a puzzle\",\n  \"Write in a journal\",\n  \"Meditate\",\n  \"Learn a new language\",\n  \"Do a workout\",\n  \"Paint or draw\",\n  \"Organize a room\",\n  \"Explore a podcast\"\n]\n\nrandom_activities = activities.sample(3)\n\nputs \"Here are three activities to do when you're feeling bored:\"\nrandom_activities.each do |activity|\n  puts \"- #{activity}\"\nend\n```\n\nThis code will randomly select three activities from a larger list each time you run it, giving you a variety of options to alleviate boredom. Just copy and paste this code into your Ruby environment, and it will suggest three activities for you to try!"
