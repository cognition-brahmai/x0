Your goal is to end up with two containers holding equal amounts of water. The catch is that you can only use the containers to transfer water, and you cannot measure the amount of water in each container. How can you achieve this?\nHint: Try filling up one container and use it to transfer water to the other containers. Think about the different combinations of containers that you can use."

Start with:\n   - Container A: 10 liters\n   - Container B: 6 liters\n   - Container C: 0 liters\n\n2. Transfer water from Container A to Container C until Container C is full:\n   - Container A: 4 liters\n   - Container B: 6 liters\n   - Container C: 6 liters\n\n3. Transfer water from Container C to Container B until Container B is full:\n   - Container A: 4 liters\n   - Container B: 6 liters (full)\n   - Container C: 0 liters\n\n4. Transfer water from Container A to Container C:\n   - Container A: 0 liters\n   - Container B: 6 liters\n   - Container C: 4 liters\n\n5. Transfer water from Container B to Container A until Container A is full:\n   - Container A: 4 liters\n   - Container B: 2 liters\n   - Container C: 4 liters\n\n6. Transfer water from Container A to Container C:\n   - Container A: 0 liters\n   - Container B: 2 liters\n   - Container C: 8 liters\n\n7. Transfer water from Container C to Container B until Container B is full:\n   - Container A: 0 liters\n   - Container B: 6 liters (full)\n   - Container C: 4 liters\n\n8. Transfer water from Container B to Container A:\n   - Container A: 4 liters\n   - Container B: 2 liters\n   - Container C: 4 liters\n\nNow you have two containers (Container A and Container C) each holding 4 liters of water."
