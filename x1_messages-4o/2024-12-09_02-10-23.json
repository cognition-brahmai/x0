For example, when I use the following code block:\n\n```python\nclass MyType(type):\n    def __init__(cls, name, bases, attrs):\n        print 'created', cls\nclass MyMixin:\n    __metaclass__ = MyType\nclass MyList(list, MyMixin): pass\n```\n\nIt works as expected and prints:\n\n```python\ncreated <class '__main__.MyMixin'>\ncreated <class '__main__.MyList'>\n```\n\nHowever, if I change the code to:\n\n```python\nclass MyType(type):\n    def __init__(cls, name, bases, attrs):\n        print 'created', cls\nclass MyMixin:\n    __metaclass__ = MyType\nclass MyObject(object, MyMixin): pass\n```\n\nIt throws a TypeError:\n\n```python\ncreated <class '__main__.MyMixin'>\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/tmp/junk.py\", line 11, in <module>\n    class MyObject(object, MyMixin): pass\nTypeError: Error when calling the metaclass bases\n    Cannot create a consistent method resolution\norder (MRO) for bases object, MyMixin\n```\n\nWhy does this happen?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering arises from how Python handles the Method Resolution Order (MRO) when using multiple inheritance, particularly when metaclasses are involved.\n\n1. **Understanding MRO:** \n   - In Python, the MRO is the order in which base classes are looked up when searching for a method. This order is crucial in multiple inheritance scenarios to ensure a consistent and predictable way to find methods.\n   - Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to determine the MRO, which is a way of combining the MROs of the parent classes in a consistent and predictable order.\n\n2. **The Code Explanation:**\n   - In the first example (`MyList` inherits from `list` and `MyMixin`), the MRO can be resolved because `list` and `MyMixin` do not conflict in terms of inheritance hierarchy. The `list` class is a built-in type, and it doesn't interfere with the custom metaclass (`MyType`) of `MyMixin`.\n\n   - In the second example (`MyObject` inherits from `object` and `MyMixin`), the conflict arises because both `object` and `MyMixin` have different metaclasses: `object` uses the default metaclass (`type`), while `MyMixin` uses `MyType`. Python expects a single, consistent metaclass for all base classes, and this discrepancy causes a conflict when determining the MRO.\n\n3. **Why the Error?**\n   - When Python tries to create the `MyObject` class, it attempts to linearize the MRO for the class. However, because `object` (with metaclass `type`) and `MyMixin` (with metaclass `MyType`) provide conflicting MROs, Python cannot create a consistent MRO. The error is essentially saying that Python can't merge these class hierarchies because of the metaclass conflict.\n\n4. **Resolution:**\n   - To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that all the base classes in the inheritance chain use the same metaclass. This can be done by explicitly setting the metaclass for the class being defined if necessary.\n\nHere's a modified version of your second example that avoids the conflict:\n\n```python\nclass MyType(type):\n    def __init__(cls, name, bases, attrs):\n        print('created', cls)\n\nclass MyMixin(metaclass=MyType):\n    pass\n\nclass MyObject(MyMixin, object, metaclass=MyType):  # Note the order and explicit metaclass\n    pass\n```\n\nBy setting the metaclass explicitly and ensuring a consistent order of inheritance, you can avoid the MRO inconsistency."
