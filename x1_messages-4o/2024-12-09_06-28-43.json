Can someone explain why I'm getting this error and how to fix it?\n\nHere is the error I received:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n  File \"test.py\", line 9, in do_something\n    do_something = classmethod(do_something)\nTypeError: unbound method do_something() must be called with B instance as first argument (got nothing instead)\n>>>\n```\n\nThe resource I'm referring to stated that \"If we're using a class method, we don't have an instance to call super with. Fortunately for us, super works even with a type as the second argument.\" This is exactly what Python is saying is not possible as it is expecting `do_something()` to be called with an instance of B. Can someone help me understand what's going wrong?"

        "content": "It looks like you're trying to use `super()` within a class method in Python, and you're encountering an issue with how it's being called. The error message suggests that the method is expecting an instance of the class as the first argument, which is common when dealing with instance methods. However, class methods work a bit differently.\n\nIn Python, class methods are defined using the `@classmethod` decorator, and they receive the class itself as the first argument (commonly named `cls`), rather than an instance of the class. When using `super()` within a class method, you need to ensure that it's being called with the correct context.\n\nHere's a basic example of how to properly use `super()` in a class method:\n\n```python\nclass A:\n    def do_something(cls):\n        print(\"A's do_something\")\n    do_something = classmethod(do_something)\n\nclass B(A):\n    def do_something(cls):\n        print(\"B's do_something\")\n        # Correct usage of super() in a class method\n        super(B, cls).do_something()\n    do_something = classmethod(do_something)\n\n# Calling the class method\nB.do_something()\n```\n\nIn this example, `B` is a subclass of `A`. The `do_something` method in `B` first prints a message, and then it uses `super()` to call the `do_something` method from its superclass `A`. Note how `super(B, cls)` is used to specify that you're calling the superclass method with the class `cls` rather than an instance.\n\nIf you're still encountering errors, double-check that you're using the `@classmethod` decorator properly and that your method definitions and `super()` calls are correctly set up as shown above. This should resolve the `TypeError` you're experiencing."
