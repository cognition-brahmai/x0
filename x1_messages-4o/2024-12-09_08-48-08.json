        "content": "To write a TypeScript program that finds the maximum value between two given arguments, you can define a function that takes two parameters and returns the greater of the two using a simple conditional check. Here\u2019s an example:\n\n```typescript\nfunction findMaxValue(a: number, b: number): number {\n  return a > b ? a : b;\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst num1 = 42;\nconst num2 = 58;\nconst maxValue = findMaxValue(num1, num2);\nconsole.log(`The maximum value between ${num1} and ${num2} is ${maxValue}.`);\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: \n   - The `findMaxValue` function is defined with two parameters `a` and `b`, both of type `number`.\n   - It uses a conditional (ternary) operator to compare the two numbers and return the greater one.\n\n2. **Example Usage**:\n   - Two numbers, `num1` and `num2`, are defined.\n   - `findMaxValue` is called with these numbers as arguments.\n   - The result is stored in `maxValue` and logged to the console.\n\nYou can test this function by changing the values of `num1` and `num2` to verify that it correctly identifies the maximum value."
