I had installed virtualenv and successfully created a virtual environment last month, but now when I try to create a new environment using `$virtualenv my_env`, I receive a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'virtualenv.seed.embed.via_app_data'`. I've confirmed that I have virtualenv version 20.0.17 installed in `/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/virtualenv/__init__.py` using `$virtualenv --version`, and it also shows up when I list my installed packages with `$pip3 list`. The problem seems to have begun after I installed Anaconda. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "It seems like the installation of Anaconda might have affected the Python environment settings on your system, potentially causing conflicts with the virtualenv package. Here are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Python Environment**:\n   - Ensure that you are using the correct Python interpreter. Anaconda might have set its Python as the default. You can check your current Python interpreter by running:\n     ```bash\n     which python\n     which python3\n     ```\n   - If needed, specify the system Python interpreter when creating a virtual environment. For example:\n     ```bash\n     /usr/bin/python3 -m venv my_env\n     ```\n\n2. **Reinstall virtualenv**:\n   - Since Anaconda may have modified the environment, it might help to reinstall virtualenv. You can do this by first uninstalling and then reinstalling:\n     ```bash\n     pip3 uninstall virtualenv\n     pip3 install virtualenv\n     ```\n\n3. **Use Python's built-in venv module**:\n   - Instead of using virtualenv, you can try using the built-in `venv` module, which is part of the Python standard library:\n     ```bash\n     python3 -m venv my_env\n     ```\n\n4. **Check Environment Variables**:\n   - Verify if any environment variables related to Python or Anaconda have changed. You can print the relevant environment variables:\n     ```bash\n     echo $PATH\n     echo $PYTHONPATH\n     ```\n   - If Anaconda paths are overriding system paths, adjust them accordingly to prioritize the system Python.\n\n5. **Activate Conda Environment if Needed**:\n   - If you prefer to use Anaconda, make sure to activate the correct conda environment before running your commands:\n     ```bash\n     conda activate base  # or your desired environment\n     ```\n\n6. **Check for Conflicts**:\n   - Ensure there are no conflicting Python versions or packages installed. You can use:\n     ```bash\n     conda list\n     ```\n\nIf the issue persists, creating a new conda environment and installing virtualenv within that environment might help isolate the problem. You can do this by:\n\n```bash\nconda create --name new_env python=3.x\nconda activate new_env\nconda install -c conda-forge virtualenv\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the conflict and create new virtual environments successfully."
