However, when I run the code, I get an AttributeError stating that the 'module' object has no attribute 'imsave'. This is the code I am using:\n```python\nimport scipy.misc\nscipy.misc.imsave\n```\nThe error message I get is:\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nAttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'imsave'\n```\nThis works fine in Python 2 but I want to avoid migrating backwards. I have installed all modules from the default repositories, including Scipy. When I run 'print(scipy.misc.__doc__)', it shows that 'imsave' should be there. Also, scipy.__version__ gives 0.11.0. When I try to directly import imsave using `from scipy.misc import imsave`, I get an ImportError stating that it cannot import name imsave. How can I resolve this?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is likely due to changes in the `scipy` library or its dependencies between different versions. The `imsave` function, traditionally part of `scipy.misc`, is known to sometimes be unavailable in certain configurations, particularly in older versions or when certain dependencies are missing.\n\nHere are some steps you can follow to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check for Dependencies**: The `imsave` function relies on the `PIL` (Python Imaging Library) or its fork, `Pillow`. Ensure that you have `Pillow` installed by running:\n   ```bash\n   pip install Pillow\n   ```\n\n2. **Update `scipy` and `numpy`**: It's possible that you're using an outdated version of `scipy`. You should consider upgrading both `scipy` and `numpy` to a more recent version that supports your use case. You can do this using:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade scipy numpy\n   ```\n\n3. **Use `imageio` as an Alternative**: If `imsave` is still unavailable, you can use the `imageio` library, which is a modern alternative for image I/O operations. Install it using:\n   ```bash\n   pip install imageio\n   ```\n   Then, replace your code with:\n   ```python\n   import imageio\n   imageio.imwrite('filename.png', image_array)\n   ```\n\n4. **Check Python Environment**: Make sure that your Python environment is properly set up and doesn't have conflicting installations. Sometimes, using a virtual environment can help manage dependencies effectively.\n\n5. **Check for Deprecation**: As libraries evolve, functions can be deprecated. It's a good practice to check the latest documentation or release notes for the library to see if there have been any changes to the function availability.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and continue with your image saving operations in your Python 3.3.1 environment on Lubuntu 13.04."
