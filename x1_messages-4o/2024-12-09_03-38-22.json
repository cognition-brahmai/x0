        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"zlib.error: Error -3 while decompressing: incorrect header check\", typically indicates a mismatch between the expected format of the data and the actual format. This usually happens when trying to decompress a gzip file using `zlib` directly instead of using the `gzip` module specifically designed for handling gzip-compressed files in Python.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use the `gzip` module, which should solve the issue:\n\n```python\nimport gzip\n\n# Open the gzip file\nwith gzip.open('abc.gz', 'rb') as fh:\n    # Read the decompressed data\n    data = fh.read()\n\n# Now `data` contains the decompressed data\nprint(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **gzip.open()**: This function is specifically designed to handle gzip-compressed files. It takes care of the gzip headers automatically, unlike `zlib`.\n- **'rb' mode**: Ensures that the file is opened in binary read mode, which is necessary for reading compressed files.\n\nBy switching to the `gzip` module, you let Python handle the specifics of the gzip format, which should resolve the header check error you are experiencing."
