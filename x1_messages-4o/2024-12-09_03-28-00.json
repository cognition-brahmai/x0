When I load the file, my memory usage increases by 2GB, which is understandable because the file contains millions of rows. My issue arises when I try to release this memory. I attempted to do this by deleting the dataframe using the command 'del df' but my memory usage didn't decrease. Am I taking the wrong approach to release memory used by a pandas data frame? If so, what is the right method? \n\nHere is the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nimport pandas\ndf = pandas.read_csv('large_txt_file.txt')\n```\n\nAnd here is how I'm trying to delete the dataframe:\n\n```python\ndel df\n```"

        "content": "When working with large datasets in pandas, memory management can be a bit tricky. Simply deleting the dataframe using `del df` does not immediately free up the memory, because Python uses a garbage collection system that doesn't release memory back to the operating system right away.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to help release memory more effectively:\n\n1. **Use `gc.collect()`**: After deleting the dataframe, you can manually invoke the garbage collector to free up memory.\n\n    ```python\n    import gc\n    \n    del df\n    gc.collect()\n    ```\n\n2. **Close Other References**: Ensure there are no other references to the dataframe, as this will prevent the memory from being freed.\n\n3. **Use `df.drop()`**: If you want to free up memory for specific columns or rows, you can use `drop()`.\n\n4. **Downcast Data Types**: Before deleting, ensure that your dataframe is using the most memory-efficient data types. For example, you can downcast numerical columns to smaller types if precision allows.\n\n5. **Use `inplace=True`**: When performing operations such as dropping columns or rows, use `inplace=True` to avoid creating copies of the dataframe.\n\n6. **Check for Memory Leaks**: Sometimes memory issues are caused by memory leaks in other parts of the code or libraries being used.\n\n7. **Restart the Kernel/Process**: If memory is not being released and you have the option, restarting the kernel or the Python process can often free up memory.\n\nIf these steps still do not free up the desired amount of memory, it might be worth checking if there are any other processes or memory-intensive operations running simultaneously that could be affecting memory usage."
