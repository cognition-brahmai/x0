However, when I try to import a Python module with the code `import os` and `cwd = os.getcw <Ctrl-space>`, two problems occur: I get a squiggly underline underneath 'os' with an \"Unresolved reference 'os'\" message and I get no suggestions when hitting Ctrl-space, when I'm expecting to see \"getcwd\". I assume that this may be due to improper configuration of IntelliJ to handle Python modules. Can anyone guide me on how to fix this issue?"

        "content": "It sounds like IntelliJ IDEA is not correctly configured to use the Python interpreter for your project, which is why it's unable to resolve Python modules like `os`. Here's how you can fix this issue:\n\n1. **Configure Python SDK:**\n   - Open your project in IntelliJ IDEA.\n   - Go to `File` -> `Project Structure` or press `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+;` on macOS.\n   - In the Project Structure dialog, click on `Project` from the left pane.\n   - In the right pane, under `Project SDK`, ensure that you have a Python SDK selected. If not, click `New...` and choose the appropriate Python interpreter installed on your system.\n\n2. **Install Python Plugin:**\n   - Go to `File` -> `Settings` (or `IntelliJ IDEA` -> `Preferences` on macOS).\n   - In the Settings/Preferences dialog, select `Plugins`.\n   - Search for \"Python\" in the Marketplace tab and ensure the Python plugin is installed and enabled.\n\n3. **Invalidate Caches and Restart:**\n   - Go to `File` -> `Invalidate Caches / Restart`.\n   - Click `Invalidate and Restart`.\n   - This can sometimes resolve issues with IntelliJ not recognizing certain modules or changes.\n\n4. **Configure the Project Interpreter:**\n   - Go to `File` -> `Settings` (or `IntelliJ IDEA` -> `Preferences` on macOS).\n   - Navigate to `Languages & Frameworks` -> `Python Interpreter`.\n   - Make sure the correct interpreter is selected. You can also add a new interpreter if needed.\n\n5. **Check Virtual Environment:**\n   - If you're using a virtual environment, make sure it is activated and configured as the interpreter in IntelliJ.\n   - You can create or add a virtual environment by going to `File` -> `Project Structure` -> `Modules`, then select your module and configure the SDK to point to your virtual environment.\n\n6. **Reimport the Project:**\n   - Sometimes, reimporting the project can help. Close the project and open it again.\n\nBy following these steps, IntelliJ IDEA should be able to resolve the Python modules correctly, and you should be able to use code completion features like `Ctrl-space` effectively."
