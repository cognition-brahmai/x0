        "content": "Yes, Python 3's `http.server` module does support IPv6. However, to explicitly bind the server to an IPv6 address, you might need to specify the IPv6 address when starting your server. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```bash\npython -m http.server [port] --bind ::1\n```\n\nIn this command, `::1` is the loopback address for IPv6, similar to `127.0.0.1` in IPv4. You can replace `::1` with any other IPv6 address you wish to bind to.\n\nIf you want to bind to all available interfaces using IPv6, you can use:\n\n```bash\npython -m http.server [port] --bind ::\n```\n\nKeep in mind that your network configuration and firewall settings need to allow IPv6 traffic for the server to be accessible."
