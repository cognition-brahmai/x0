However, I'm encountering an issue where the file size changes after the PUT command is executed. The size of the file is different from that of the file on the server. When I download the file again from the FTP server, the only difference I notice is the CR/LF mark. This creates a problem as the same script is comparing the size of the files to update. The script works perfectly in PHP via ftp_put. Can anyone suggest what might be causing this issue and how to resolve it?\n\nHere is the Python code that I'm using:\n\n```python\nfrom ftplib import FTP\n\nftpserver = \"myserver\"\nftpuser = \"myuser\"\nftppass = \"mypwd\"\n\nlocfile =  \"g:/test/style.css\"\nftpfile =  \"/temp/style.css\"\n\ntry:\n    ftp = FTP(ftpserver, ftpuser, ftppass)\nexcept:\n    exit (\"Cannot connect\")\n\nf = open (locfile, \"r\")\ntry:\n    ftp.delete (ftpfile)\nexcept:\n    pass\n\n# ftp.sendcmd (\"TYPE I\")\n# ftp.storlines(\"STOR %s\" % ftpfile, f)\nftp.storbinary(\"STOR %s\" % ftpfile, f)\nf.close()\n\nftp.dir (ftpfile)\nftp.quit()\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to the difference in line endings between the files on your local system and the FTP server. In some cases, especially when transferring text files, the difference between CR (Carriage Return) and LF (Line Feed) can cause discrepancies in file sizes.\n\nHere's what you can do to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Use the Correct Mode for Text Files**: Since you're dealing with a text file (`style.css`), you should use `storlines` for ASCII mode transfers, which handles line endings automatically. However, you commented out the `storlines` call. Uncomment it and try again:\n\n   ```python\n   ftp.storlines(\"STOR %s\" % ftpfile, f)\n   ```\n\n2. **Open the File in Binary Mode**: If you prefer to use `storbinary`, ensure you open the file in binary mode:\n\n   ```python\n   f = open(locfile, \"rb\")\n   ftp.storbinary(\"STOR %s\" % ftpfile, f)\n   ```\n\n3. **Normalize Line Endings**: If you must use `storbinary` and line endings are causing issues, you can normalize line endings in your local file before uploading:\n\n   ```python\n   with open(locfile, 'r') as file:\n       content = file.read().replace('\\r\\n', '\\n')  # Normalize line endings\n\n   with open(locfile, 'wb') as file:\n       file.write(content.encode('utf-8'))\n\n   with open(locfile, 'rb') as f:\n       ftp.storbinary(\"STOR %s\" % ftpfile, f)\n   ```\n\n4. **Compare Using Hashes Instead of Sizes**: If file size is not a reliable method for comparison due to line ending differences, consider using hashes (like MD5) to compare files. This will ensure that you're comparing the actual content rather than file size.\n\nHere's an example of how you might implement this:\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\n\ndef calculate_md5(file_path):\n    hash_md5 = hashlib.md5()\n    with open(file_path, \"rb\") as f:\n        for chunk in iter(lambda: f.read(4096), b\"\"):\n            hash_md5.update(chunk)\n    return hash_md5.hexdigest()\n\nlocal_md5 = calculate_md5(locfile)\n\n# After uploading, download the file back and calculate its MD5\n# Then compare `local_md5` with the MD5 of the downloaded file.\n\n# Example: Download the file from the server for comparison\nwith open('downloaded_style.css', 'wb') as f:\n    ftp.retrbinary(\"RETR %s\" % ftpfile, f.write)\n\nserver_md5 = calculate_md5('downloaded_style.css')\n\nif local_md5 == server_md5:\n    print(\"Files are identical\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Files differ\")\n```\n\nBy using one or a combination of these strategies, you should be able to mitigate the issues caused by line ending differences between systems."
