I have a section of the form to enter event information for a performance or rehearsal, using the following Event model:\n\n```python\nclass Event(models.Model):\n    event_id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)\n    date = models.DateField()\n    event_type = models.ForeignKey(EventType)\n    description = models.TextField()\n```\n\nI also have an inline FormSet that links the band members to the event and records whether they were present, absent, or excused, using the following Attendance model:\n\n```python\nclass Attendance(models.Model):\n    attendance_id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)\n    event_id = models.ForeignKey(Event)\n    member_id = models.ForeignKey(Member)\n    attendance_type = models.ForeignKey(AttendanceType)\n    comment = models.TextField(blank=True)\n```\n\nWhat I want to do is pre-populate this inline FormSet with entries for all the current members and default them to being present (around 60 members). However, Django doesn't seem to allow initial values in this case. I need some suggestions on how to accomplish this."

        "content": "To pre-populate an inline FormSet in Django with entries for all current members and default them to being present, you'll need to customize the formset setup process. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Create a Custom FormSet**: Subclass the `BaseInlineFormSet` to customize the formset behavior. This will allow you to set initial data for each form in the formset.\n\n2. **Initialize the FormSet with Initial Data**: In the custom formset class, override the `__init__` method to provide initial data for each form. This data will include the member information and default the attendance to \"present.\"\n\n3. **Use the Custom FormSet in the Admin**: If you're using Django admin, override the `get_formset` method in the `EventAdmin` class to use your custom formset.\n\nHere's how you can implement these steps:\n\n```python\nfrom django import forms\nfrom django.forms.models import BaseInlineFormSet, inlineformset_factory\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom .models import Event, Attendance, Member, AttendanceType\n\n# Step 1: Create a Custom Form and FormSet\n\nclass AttendanceForm(forms.ModelForm):\n    class Meta:\n        model = Attendance\n        fields = ['member_id', 'attendance_type', 'comment']\n\nclass CustomAttendanceFormSet(BaseInlineFormSet):\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n        members = Member.objects.all()  # Retrieve all current members\n        # Assuming 'present' is a valid AttendanceType, adjust it accordingly\n        present_type = AttendanceType.objects.get(name='Present')\n        \n        initial_data = [{'member_id': member.id, 'attendance_type': present_type.id} for member in members]\n        \n        # Set the initial data for each form in the formset\n        for form, initial in zip(self.forms, initial_data):\n            form.initial.update(initial)\n\n# Step 2: Create an Inline FormSet Factory\n\nAttendanceInlineFormSet = inlineformset_factory(\n    Event,\n    Attendance,\n    form=AttendanceForm,\n    formset=CustomAttendanceFormSet,\n    extra=0,  # This ensures no extra empty forms are added\n    can_delete=False\n)\n\n# Step 3: Use the Custom FormSet in the Admin\n\nclass AttendanceInline(admin.TabularInline):\n    model = Attendance\n    formset = AttendanceInlineFormSet\n    extra = 0  # No extra forms\n\nclass EventAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    inlines = [AttendanceInline]\n\nadmin.site.register(Event, EventAdmin)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **CustomAttendanceFormSet:** This class inherits from `BaseInlineFormSet` and initializes each form with data for a member, defaulting the attendance type to \"present.\"\n\n- **inlineformset_factory:** This function creates a formset class with your custom form and formset.\n\n- **AttendanceInline:** This inline class is used in the Django admin to display the formset as part of the `Event` admin view.\n\n- **EventAdmin:** Integrates the inline formset into the admin interface, allowing you to manage attendance records directly from the event admin page.\n\nBy following this approach, you'll have a pre-populated inline formset with all members marked as present by default, ready for further customization as needed."
