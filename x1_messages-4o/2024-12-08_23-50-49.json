For example, if I have a paragraph of text, what script can I use to find the most frequent combinations of non-silent vowels and consonants (such as \"th\" or \"ea\")?

        "content": "To write a script that identifies the most common non-silent vowel and consonant combinations in a given text, you can use Python. This script will process the text, count the frequency of each vowel-consonant combination, and display the most common ones. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef find_most_common_combinations(text, combination_length=2):\n    # Convert the text to lowercase for consistency\n    text = text.lower()\n\n    # Define a regex pattern to match vowel-consonant combinations\n    pattern = re.compile(r'[aeiou][bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz]|[bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz][aeiou]')\n\n    # Find all matches in the text\n    matches = pattern.findall(text)\n\n    # Count the frequency of each combination\n    combination_counts = Counter(matches)\n\n    # Find the most common combinations\n    most_common_combinations = combination_counts.most_common()\n\n    return most_common_combinations\n\n# Example usage\ntext = \"\"\"\nThis is an example paragraph. The script should identify the most common combinations of vowels and consonants.\n\"\"\"\n\nmost_common_combinations = find_most_common_combinations(text)\n\nprint(\"Most common vowel-consonant combinations:\")\nfor combination, count in most_common_combinations:\n    print(f\"{combination}: {count}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Lowercasing**: The text is converted to lowercase to ensure consistency in matching.\n2. **Regex Pattern**: The pattern `[aeiou][bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz]|[bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz][aeiou]` is used to find combinations of a vowel followed by a consonant or a consonant followed by a vowel.\n3. **Finding Matches**: `findall` method of the regex pattern is used to extract all matching combinations from the text.\n4. **Counting Combinations**: The `Counter` from the `collections` module is used to count the frequency of each combination.\n5. **Displaying Results**: The most common combinations are displayed along with their counts.\n\nYou can adjust the `combination_length` or modify the regex pattern if you're interested in different types or lengths of combinations. This script focuses on finding two-character combinations, which is a common requirement."
