        "content": "In Python, when using the `.format()` method, curly braces `{}` are used as placeholders for variable substitution. To include literal curly braces in the output, you need to escape them by doubling them: `{{` for an opening brace and `}}` for a closing brace. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired output:\n\n```python\nprint(\"{{Hello}} {0}\".format(42))\n```\n\nThis will correctly print:\n\n```\n{Hello} 42\n```\n\nIn this modified version, `{{` and `}}` are interpreted as literal `{` and `}` respectively, allowing you to include them in your formatted string."
