        "content": "Yes, there is a more concise way to express this condition by using sets. You can compare sets to determine if two pairs, `(x, y)` and `(a, b)`, contain the same elements, regardless of their order:\n\n```python\nif {x, y} == {a, b}:\n```\n\nThis approach leverages the properties of sets, which are unordered collections of unique elements. If both sets contain the same elements, the condition will evaluate to `True`, effectively capturing both scenarios: `(x == a and y == b)` or `(x == b and y == a)`. This is both efficient and elegant."
