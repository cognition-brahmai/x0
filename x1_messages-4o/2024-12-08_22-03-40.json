        "content": "To determine the amount of wrapping paper needed to cover a spherical object, you need to calculate the surface area of the sphere. The formula for the surface area \\(A\\) of a sphere with radius \\(r\\) is:\n\n\\[ A = 4\\pi r^2 \\]\n\nGiven that the radius \\(r\\) is 9.7 cm, you substitute this value into the formula:\n\n\\[ A = 4\\pi (9.7)^2 \\]\n\n\\[ A = 4\\pi \\times 94.09 \\]\n\n\\[ A \\approx 4 \\times 3.14159 \\times 94.09 \\]\n\n\\[ A \\approx 1182.96 \\text{ cm}^2 \\]\n\nTherefore, you would need approximately 1182.96 square centimeters of wrapping paper to cover the entire surface of the sphere. To ensure you have enough paper, you might consider using a slightly larger rectangular sheet, but this calculation gives you the minimum area needed."
