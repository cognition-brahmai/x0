        "content": "I have a Python script for sending emails using the smtplib module. The script is designed to send emails to multiple recipients in the \"To\" field and also to people in the \"Cc\" field. When I execute the script, the emails are successfully delivered to the recipients in the \"To\" field, but the people in the \"Cc\" field are not receiving the emails. However, when I check the emails received by the \"To\" recipients, the \"Cc\" recipients are correctly listed. I've checked this behavior with different email servers, including Gmail, and the issue persists. Is there an error in my script causing this problem?\n\nHere's the script I'm using:\n\n```python\nimport smtplib\nfrom email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart\nfrom email.mime.text import MIMEText\nimport os\n\nFROMADDR = \"myaddr@server.com\"\nPASSWORD = 'foo'\n\nTOADDR   = ['toaddr1@server.com', 'toaddr2@server.com']\nCCADDR   = ['ccaddr1@server.com', 'ccaddr2@server.com']\n\n# Create message container - the correct MIME type is multipart/alternative.\nmsg            = MIMEMultipart('alternative')\nmsg['Subject'] = 'Test'\nmsg['From']    = FROMADDR\nmsg['To']      = ', '.join(TOADDR)\nmsg['Cc']      = ', '.join(CCADDR)\n\n# Create the body of the message (an HTML version).\ntext = \"\"\"Hi  this is the body\n\"\"\"\n\n# Record the MIME types of both parts - text/plain and text/html.\nbody = MIMEText(text, 'plain')\n\n# Attach parts into message container.\nmsg.attach(body)\n\n# Send the message via local SMTP server.\ns = smtplib.SMTP('server.com', 587)\ns.set_debuglevel(1)\ns.ehlo()\ns.starttls()\ns.login(FROMADDR, PASSWORD)\ns.sendmail(FROMADDR, TOADDR, msg.as_string())\ns.quit()\n```"

        "content": "The issue with your script is that you are not including the recipients in the \"Cc\" field when you call the `s.sendmail()` function. The `sendmail()` function requires all recipients (both \"To\" and \"Cc\") to be included in the recipient list that is passed as its second argument. Here\u2019s how you can fix it:\n\n```python\nimport smtplib\nfrom email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart\nfrom email.mime.text import MIMEText\n\nFROMADDR = \"myaddr@server.com\"\nPASSWORD = 'foo'\n\n# Recipients\nTOADDR = ['toaddr1@server.com', 'toaddr2@server.com']\nCCADDR = ['ccaddr1@server.com', 'ccaddr2@server.com']\n\n# Create message container - the correct MIME type is multipart/alternative.\nmsg = MIMEMultipart('alternative')\nmsg['Subject'] = 'Test'\nmsg['From'] = FROMADDR\nmsg['To'] = ', '.join(TOADDR)\nmsg['Cc'] = ', '.join(CCADDR)\n\n# Create the body of the message (an HTML version).\ntext = \"\"\"Hi, this is the body\n\"\"\"\n\n# Record the MIME types of both parts - text/plain and text/html.\nbody = MIMEText(text, 'plain')\n\n# Attach parts into message container.\nmsg.attach(body)\n\n# Combine TOADDR and CCADDR for the recipient list\nall_recipients = TOADDR + CCADDR\n\n# Send the message via local SMTP server.\ns = smtplib.SMTP('server.com', 587)\ns.set_debuglevel(1)\ns.ehlo()\ns.starttls()\ns.login(FROMADDR, PASSWORD)\ns.sendmail(FROMADDR, all_recipients, msg.as_string())\ns.quit()\n```\n\nIn the updated script, I combined `TOADDR` and `CCADDR` into a single list `all_recipients` and passed this list to the `s.sendmail()` method. This ensures that the email is sent to every address listed in both the \"To\" and \"Cc\" fields."
