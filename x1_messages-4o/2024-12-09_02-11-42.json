Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Get the full path of the directory where the script is located\nscript_directory = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))\n\n# Extract the name of the directory\ndirectory_name = os.path.basename(script_directory)\n\nprint(directory_name)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `os.path.realpath(__file__)` provides the full path to your script.\n- `os.path.dirname()` gives you the directory containing the script.\n- `os.path.basename()` extracts the last part of the path, which is the name of the directory.\n\nSo, if your script is located at `/home/user/test/my_script.py`, `directory_name` will be `\"test\"`."
