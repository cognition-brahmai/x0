When I use these operations with these snippets of code:\n\n```python\na = [1, 2, 3]\na[-1] += a.pop()\n```\n\nThis gives me the result `[1, 6]`.\n\nAnd when I use:\n\n```python\na = [1, 2, 3]\na[0] += a.pop()\n```\n\nI get the result `[4, 2]`. Can you explain the order of evaluation that resulted in these outcomes?"

        "content": "Certainly! The behavior you're observing is due to the order of evaluation in Python when using list operations like `pop()`, indexing, and the `+=` operator. Let's break down each example to understand what's happening.\n\n### Example 1:\n```python\na = [1, 2, 3]\na[-1] += a.pop()\n```\n\n1. **`a.pop()`**: This operation is evaluated first. It removes and returns the last element of the list `a`. So, `a.pop()` returns `3`, and the list `a` becomes `[1, 2]`.\n\n2. **`a[-1]`**: After popping the last element, `a[-1]` refers to the new last element of the list, which is now `2`.\n\n3. **`a[-1] += 3`**: This operation is equivalent to `a[-1] = a[-1] + 3`. With `a[-1]` being `2`, it becomes `2 + 3`, resulting in `5`.\n\nThus, the list `a` becomes `[1, 5]`.\n\n### Example 2:\n```python\na = [1, 2, 3]\na[0] += a.pop()\n```\n\n1. **`a.pop()`**: Again, this is evaluated first, removing and returning the last element of the list, which is `3`. The list `a` becomes `[1, 2]`.\n\n2. **`a[0]`**: This refers to the first element of the list, which is `1`.\n\n3. **`a[0] += 3`**: This operation is equivalent to `a[0] = a[0] + 3`. With `a[0]` being `1`, it now becomes `1 + 3`, resulting in `4`.\n\nThus, the list `a` becomes `[4, 2]`.\n\n### Summary:\n\nIn both examples, the key point is that `a.pop()` is evaluated first, which modifies the list by removing the last element and returns that element. The subsequent operations then use the modified list state to perform the `+=` operation. The index for the `+=` operation is determined before any side effects (like `pop()`) are applied to the list, so the subsequent modifications are based on the already determined index positions."
