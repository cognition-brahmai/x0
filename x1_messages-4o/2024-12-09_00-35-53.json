        "content": "Yes, you can gracefully terminate a thread running in an infinite loop when the main program ends, even if you terminate the program using Ctrl+C. To achieve this, you can use a flag or a signal handler to manage the termination process.\n\nHere's a basic approach using a flag:\n\n1. **Using a Flag**: You can create a shared variable (a flag) that the thread regularly checks to determine if it should exit.\n\n```python\nimport threading\nimport time\n\n# A flag to indicate if the thread should terminate\nshould_terminate = False\n\ndef worker_thread():\n    global should_terminate\n    while not should_terminate:\n        # Perform the work\n        print(\"Thread is running...\")\n        time.sleep(1)\n    print(\"Thread is terminating...\")\n\ndef main():\n    global should_terminate\n\n    # Create and start the thread\n    thread = threading.Thread(target=worker_thread)\n    thread.start()\n\n    try:\n        while True:\n            time.sleep(0.1)  # Main program doing other work\n    except KeyboardInterrupt:\n        print(\"Main program is terminating...\")\n        should_terminate = True\n        thread.join()  # Wait for the thread to finish\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n2. **Using Signal Handlers**: You can handle the `SIGINT` signal to set the flag when Ctrl+C is pressed.\n\n```python\nimport threading\nimport time\nimport signal\nimport sys\n\n# A flag to indicate if the thread should terminate\nshould_terminate = False\n\ndef worker_thread():\n    global should_terminate\n    while not should_terminate:\n        # Perform the work\n        print(\"Thread is running...\")\n        time.sleep(1)\n    print(\"Thread is terminating...\")\n\ndef signal_handler(sig, frame):\n    global should_terminate\n    print(\"Signal received, terminating...\")\n    should_terminate = True\n\ndef main():\n    global should_terminate\n\n    # Register the signal handler for Ctrl+C\n    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)\n\n    # Create and start the thread\n    thread = threading.Thread(target=worker_thread)\n    thread.start()\n\n    try:\n        while not should_terminate:\n            time.sleep(0.1)  # Main program doing other work\n    finally:\n        thread.join()  # Wait for the thread to finish\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nBoth of these approaches ensure that your thread will terminate gracefully when the main program is interrupted with Ctrl+C. The key is to set a termination flag that the thread checks regularly, allowing it to exit the loop and finish execution cleanly."
