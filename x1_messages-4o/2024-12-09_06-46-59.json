However, when I tried to run 'sudo service quokkacms start' from a bash script I have created, I received an error: 'RuntimeError: Click will abort further execution because Python 3 was configured to use ASCII as encoding for the environment. Either switch to Python 2 or consult http://click.pocoo.org/python3/ for mitigation steps.' I've tried solutions recommended by Click but have not been successful. How can I resolve this?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the lack of proper locale settings in your environment, which causes Python to default to ASCII encoding. To resolve this, you need to ensure that your environment is set to use a UTF-8 encoding. Here\u2019s how you can fix it:\n\n1. **Set Locale in your Environment:**\n   You can export the necessary locale variables in your bash script before starting the service. Here's an example of how to do it:\n\n   ```bash\n   #!/bin/bash\n\n   export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8\n   export LANG=en_US.UTF-8\n   export LANGUAGE=en_US.UTF-8\n\n   sudo service quokkacms start\n   ```\n\n   Make sure to replace `en_US.UTF-8` with the appropriate locale for your system if it's different.\n\n2. **Check Available Locales:**\n   You can list available locales on your system using:\n\n   ```bash\n   locale -a\n   ```\n\n   Ensure that `en_US.UTF-8` or your preferred UTF-8 locale is listed. If it\u2019s not, you may need to generate it.\n\n3. **Generate Missing Locales:**\n   If the required locale is not available, you can generate it using:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo localedef -i en_US -f UTF-8 en_US.UTF-8\n   ```\n\n   Again, replace `en_US.UTF-8` with your desired locale if necessary.\n\n4. **Reboot the System:**\n   After setting the locale, you might need to reboot your system to ensure that changes take effect throughout all services.\n\n5. **Verify Locale Settings:**\n   After rebooting, verify that the locale settings are correct by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   locale\n   ```\n\n   It should reflect the UTF-8 settings you\u2019ve configured.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the encoding issue and successfully start your Quokka CMS service."
