        "content": "How can I run unittest.main() for all source files in a Python subdirectory?\n\nI am working on a Python module comprised of multiple source files, with each source file having an associated test class derived from unittest. Here's a look at my directory structure:\n\n```\ndirFoo\\\n    test.py\n    dirBar\\\n        __init__.py\n        Foo.py\n        Bar.py\n```\n\nTo test either Foo.py or Bar.py, I have added the following code at the end of each:\n\n```\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\nThis allows me to run Python on either source, like so:\n\n```\n$ python Foo.py\n...........\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nRan 11 tests in 2.314s\n\nOK\n```\n\nHowever, I'd prefer to have \"test.py\" automatically search dirBar for any unittest derived classes and make a single call to \"unittest.main()\". What's the best way to achieve this? I've tried using Python's execfile to execute every *.py file in dirBar, but this only runs for the first .py file found and then exits the calling test.py. Moreover, I have to duplicate my code by adding unittest.main() in every source file, which isn't in line with DRY principles."

        "content": "To run all unittests from multiple source files within a subdirectory without having to manually invoke `unittest.main()` in each source file, you can use the `unittest` framework's discovery feature. This allows you to automatically discover and run all test cases in a directory. Here's how you can set this up:\n\n1. **Organize your tests**: Ensure your test files are named appropriately (typically starting with `test_` or ending with `_test`) so that they can be automatically discovered. For example, you might rename your test classes to `test_Foo.py` and `test_Bar.py`.\n\n2. **Use Test Discovery**: Modify your `test.py` file to use the `unittest` module's test discovery. You don't need to modify your source files (`Foo.py`, `Bar.py`) to call `unittest.main()` anymore. Here's how you can set up `test.py`:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Discover and run all tests in the 'dirBar' directory\n    # The pattern 'test*.py' will match any files starting with 'test'\n    test_loader = unittest.TestLoader()\n    test_suite = test_loader.discover(start_dir='dirBar', pattern='test*.py')\n    test_runner = unittest.TextTestRunner()\n    test_runner.run(test_suite)\n```\n\n3. **Run the Tests**: Execute `test.py` to run all discovered tests in `dirBar`.\n\n```bash\n$ python test.py\n```\n\nThis approach leverages the built-in test discovery capabilities of `unittest`, avoiding the need for manually invoking tests in each module, and adheres to DRY principles by centralizing the test execution logic in a single file. Moreover, it allows you to easily add more test files as your project grows, without modifying the `test.py` script."
