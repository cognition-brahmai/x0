I'm trying to regress 'FIUIX' on 'FSTMX', then 'FSAIX' on 'FSTMX', and finally 'FSAVX' on 'FSTMX'. After each regression, I want to store the residuals. However, I'm getting the syntax wrong and need guidance on the best way to do this. Here is my current code:\n\n```\nall_data = {}\nfor ticker in ['FIUIX', 'FSAIX', 'FSAVX', 'FSTMX']:\n    all_data[ticker] = web.get_data_yahoo(ticker, '1/1/2010', '1/1/2015')\n\nprices = DataFrame({tic: data['Adj Close'] for tic, data in all_data.iteritems()})  \nreturns = prices.pct_change()\n\nregs = sm.OLS(returns.FIUIX,returns.FSTMX).fit()\n\nresids = {}\nfor k in returns.keys():\n    reg = sm.OLS(returns[k],returns.FSTMX).fit()\n    resids[k] = reg.resid\n```\n\nI believe the issue lies in how I'm referencing the returns column by key, so `returns[k]` is probably incorrect. Can anyone provide guidance on how to properly accomplish this?"

        "content": "Certainly! In your code, you are trying to perform linear regression of multiple dependent variables on a single independent variable using the `statsmodels` library. Let's address the issue and refine your approach.\n\nThe primary issue seems to be with how you iterate over the columns of your DataFrame and how you reference them within the `OLS` model. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieving your goal:\n\n1. **Ensure you have the necessary imports**:\n   Make sure you have imported the necessary libraries at the beginning of your script:\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n   from pandas_datareader import data as web\n   import statsmodels.api as sm\n   ```\n\n2. **Iterate over the dependent variables**:\n   You need to set up the loop to iterate over the dependent variables ('FIUIX', 'FSAIX', 'FSAVX') while keeping 'FSTMX' as the independent variable.\n\n3. **Correctly reference the columns**:\n   Use the DataFrame column names correctly when fitting the model.\n\nHere's a revised version of your code:\n\n```python\n# Import necessary libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom pandas_datareader import data as web\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\n# Fetch data\nall_data = {}\ntickers = ['FIUIX', 'FSAIX', 'FSAVX', 'FSTMX']\nfor ticker in tickers:\n    all_data[ticker] = web.get_data_yahoo(ticker, '1/1/2010', '1/1/2015')\n\n# Create a DataFrame of adjusted close prices\nprices = pd.DataFrame({tic: data['Adj Close'] for tic, data in all_data.items()})\n\n# Calculate daily returns\nreturns = prices.pct_change().dropna()\n\n# Initialize a dictionary to store residuals\nresids = {}\n\n# Perform regression and store residuals\nfor dependent in ['FIUIX', 'FSAIX', 'FSAVX']:\n    independent = 'FSTMX'\n    X = sm.add_constant(returns[independent])  # Add a constant term for the intercept\n    y = returns[dependent]\n    model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()\n    resids[dependent] = model.resid\n\n# Display the residuals\nfor key, value in resids.items():\n    print(f\"Residuals for {key} regressed on {independent}:\")\n    print(value)\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n- **Adding a constant**: When using `statsmodels` for linear regression, it's often necessary to add a constant to the independent variable to account for the intercept. This is done using `sm.add_constant()`.\n\n- **Iterating over dependent variables**: The loop is set up to iterate over each dependent variable you want to regress against 'FSTMX'.\n\n- **Dropping NaN values**: After calculating percentage changes, use `.dropna()` to remove any NaN values resulting from the calculation.\n\n- **Printing residuals**: The residuals for each regression are stored in a dictionary and printed out.\n\nThis setup should help you perform the regression analyses and store the residuals as needed. Let me know if you need further clarification or assistance!"
