When I try to concatenate the error message to a string, it throws a TypeError: `'FileNotFoundError' object to str implicitly`. For example, the following code works:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    os.open(\"test.txt\", os.O_RDONLY)\nexcept OSError as err:\n    print (\"I got this error: \", err)\n```\n\nBut this code does not:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    os.open(\"test.txt\", os.O_RDONLY)\nexcept OSError as err:\n    print (\"I got this error: \" + err)\n```\n\nThis throws the following error: `TypeError: Can't convert 'FileNotFoundError' object to str implicitly`."

        "content": "In Python, you can convert an exception to a string using the built-in `str()` function, which is designed to handle this conversion. When you encounter an exception object like `err`, using `str(err)` will give you the string representation of the error message.\n\nYour code can be updated as follows to avoid the `TypeError`:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ntry:\n    os.open(\"test.txt\", os.O_RDONLY)\nexcept OSError as err:\n    print(\"I got this error: \" + str(err))\n```\n\nHere, `str(err)` converts the exception object `err` to its string representation, allowing you to concatenate it with other strings without any issue. This is the recommended way to work with exception messages as strings in Python."
