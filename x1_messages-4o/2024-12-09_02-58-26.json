        "content": "To print colored output in the terminal using Python 3, you can use ANSI escape codes, which are supported by most terminals. For instance, to print text in blue, you can use the ANSI escape code for blue text (`\\033[34m`). Here's how you can modify your `print` statement to display \"hello friends\" in blue:\n\n```python\nprint('\\033[34m' + 'hello friends' + '\\033[0m')\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the code:\n- `\\033[34m` is the escape code for blue text. `\\033` is the escape character, `[34m` sets the text color to blue.\n- `\\033[0m` resets the color back to default after the text is printed.\n\nIf you want to use a more user-friendly and versatile approach, you can utilize libraries like `colorama` or `termcolor`. Below is an example using `colorama`:\n\n1. First, install the `colorama` library if you haven't already:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install colorama\n   ```\n\n2. Then, use the library in your Python script:\n\n   ```python\n   from colorama import Fore, Style\n\n   print(Fore.BLUE + 'hello friends' + Style.RESET_ALL)\n   ```\n\nIn the example above:\n- `Fore.BLUE` sets the text color to blue.\n- `Style.RESET_ALL` resets the text style and color back to default.\n\nThis method is cross-platform and works well on Windows, macOS, and Linux."
