Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Your Counter object\ncounter = Counter({'A': 10, 'C': 5, 'H': 4})\n\n# Convert to sorted list of tuples\nsorted_items = sorted(counter.items())\n\n# Convert back to a Counter or dictionary\nsorted_counter = Counter(dict(sorted_items))\n\n# Print the sorted Counter\nprint(sorted_counter)\n```\n\nThis will sort your `Counter` by keys and output:\n\n```\nCounter({'A': 10, 'C': 5, 'H': 4})\n```\n\nSince the keys were already in alphabetical order, the output remains the same. If the keys were in a different order, this method would rearrange them alphabetically."
