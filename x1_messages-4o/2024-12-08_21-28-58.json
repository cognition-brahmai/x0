        "content": "To calculate the value of \\( g(3) + f(5) \\) using the given vectors in the C++ program, you need to access the appropriate elements of the `fx` and `gx` vectors. Since the vectors are indexed starting from 0, \\( g(3) \\) corresponds to the third element of `gx` and \\( f(5) \\) corresponds to the fifth element of `fx`. Here is the code to add to the program:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    vector<int> x = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n    vector<int> fx = {3, 6, 9, 12, 15};\n    vector<int> gx = {5, 8, 11, 14, 17};\n    \n    int g3 = gx[2]; // g(3)\n    int f5 = fx[4]; // f(5)\n    \n    int result = g3 + f5;\n    \n    cout << \"g(3) + f(5) = \" << result << endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `gx[2]` accesses the third element of the `gx` vector, which is \\( g(3) = 11 \\).\n- `fx[4]` accesses the fifth element of the `fx` vector, which is \\( f(5) = 15 \\).\n- The result is calculated as `g3 + f5` and printed to the console."
