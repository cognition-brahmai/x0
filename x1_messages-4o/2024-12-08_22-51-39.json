Below is an explanation of blockchain technology and its benefits, formatted in LaTeX:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\section*{Blockchain Technology}\n\n\\subsection*{Definition}\n\nA \\textbf{blockchain} is a distributed ledger technology that allows data to be stored across a network of computers, ensuring that the information is transparent, secure, and immutable. Each block contains a set of transactions, a timestamp, and a cryptographic hash of the previous block, linking them together to form a chain.\n\n\\subsection*{Structure}\n\nThe blockchain is composed of a series of blocks, where each block $B_i$ can be represented as:\n\n\\[\nB_i = (T_i, H_{i-1}, N_i)\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item $T_i$ is the list of transactions in block $i$.\n  \\item $H_{i-1}$ is the hash of the previous block $B_{i-1}$.\n  \\item $N_i$ is the nonce, a number used once, which is a random or semi-random number issued in an authentication protocol to ensure that old communications cannot be reused in replay attacks.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection*{Benefits}\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item \\textbf{Decentralization:} Eliminates the need for a central authority, as the ledger is maintained by a peer-to-peer network.\n  \n  \\item \\textbf{Transparency:} Transactions are visible to all participants in the network, increasing trust and accountability.\n  \n  \\item \\textbf{Security:} Uses cryptographic techniques to secure data and ensure that once data is recorded, it cannot be altered retroactively.\n  \n  \\item \\textbf{Immutability:} Once a block is added to the blockchain, it becomes part of an unchangeable record, which prevents tampering and fraud.\n  \n  \\item \\textbf{Efficiency:} Can streamline and automate processes, reducing the time and cost involved in traditional methods.\n  \n  \\item \\textbf{Traceability:} Enhances the ability to track and trace goods in supply chains, improving logistical efficiency.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nYou can compile the above LaTeX code using a LaTeX editor to get a formatted document explaining blockchain technology and its benefits."
