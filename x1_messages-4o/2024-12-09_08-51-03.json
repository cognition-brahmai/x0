Assuming you have a table named `employees` with columns `salary` and `department`, the SQL query would look like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(salary) AS average_salary\nFROM employees\nWHERE department = 'Engineering';\n```\n\nThis query calculates the average salary for all employees whose department is 'Engineering'. Adjust the table and column names as needed to match your actual database schema."
