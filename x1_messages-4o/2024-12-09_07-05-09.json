It is supposed to print \"The names are the same\" if the names are identical. If they are the same length but with different letters, it should print \"The names are different, but are the same length\". I am having trouble with the last four lines of my code. When I run it, I get a traceback error. Here is the code:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n# Enter your code for \"What's In (The Length Of) A Name?\" here.\nname1 = input(\"Enter name 1: \")\nname2 = input(\"Enter name 2: \")\nlen(name1)\nlen(name2)\nif len(name1) == len(name2):\n    if name1 == name2:\n        print (\"The names are the same\")\n    else:\n        print (\"The names are different, but are the same length\")\n    if len(name1) > len(name2):\n        print (\"'{0}' is longer than '{1}'\"% name1, name2)\n    elif len(name1) < len(name2):\n        print (\"'{0}' is longer than '{1}'\"% name2, name1)\n```\n\nWhen running, I get the following error:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"program.py\", line 13, in <module>\n    print (\"'{0}' is longer than '{1}'\"% name1, name2)\nTypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting\n```\n\nHow can I resolve this error?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the incorrect use of string formatting. When using the `%` operator for string formatting, you need to provide the variables as a tuple if you're formatting more than one value. Here's how you can fix it:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n# Enter your code for \"What's In (The Length Of) A Name?\" here.\nname1 = input(\"Enter name 1: \")\nname2 = input(\"Enter name 2: \")\n\nif len(name1) == len(name2):\n    if name1 == name2:\n        print(\"The names are the same\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The names are different, but are the same length\")\nelse:\n    if len(name1) > len(name2):\n        print(\"'{0}' is longer than '{1}'\".format(name1, name2))\n    elif len(name1) < len(name2):\n        print(\"'{0}' is longer than '{1}'\".format(name2, name1))\n```\n\nHere's what was changed:\n1. The condition to check if the names are of different lengths is moved outside of the first `if` block that checks if their lengths are the same. This ensures that the length comparison only happens if the lengths are different.\n2. The string formatting method was changed from `%` to `str.format()`, which is a more modern and often clearer way to format strings in Python.\n\nNow, your code should work without errors."
