        "content": "How can I avoid infinite recursion with super() in Python when implementing inheritance in classes? I have the following class hierarchy with classes A, B, and C, where class B is derived from class A, and class C is derived from class B. When I instantiate class B, it works as expected. However, instantiating class C leads to infinite recursion which results in a stack overflow. Here is my code:\n\n```python\nclass A(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n          self.a = 1\n\nclass B(A):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.b = 2\n        super(self.__class__, self).__init__()\n\nclass C(B):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.c = 3\n        super(self.__class__, self).__init__()\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to how you're using the `super()` function in combination with `self.__class__`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential infinite recursion because `self.__class__` doesn't refer to the class in which the `super()` call is made, but rather, it refers to the class of the instance itself. This can cause `super()` to keep looking for the next class in the method resolution order (MRO), leading to a loop.\n\nTo avoid this problem, you should use `super()` with explicit class references, or better yet, use `super()` without any arguments, which automatically handles the lookup correctly. Here is the corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nclass A(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.a = 1\n\nclass B(A):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()  # Correct usage of super()\n        self.b = 2\n\nclass C(B):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()  # Correct usage of super()\n        self.c = 3\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the changes:\n\n1. Use `super().__init__()` without any arguments. This is the recommended way in Python 3, as it automatically determines the method resolution order and looks for the next class in line properly.\n\n2. Ensure that you call `super().__init__()` before setting attributes specific to the class. This ensures that all the necessary initialization from parent classes is completed before adding new attributes.\n\nBy doing this, you avoid the infinite recursion issue and ensure that object initialization is handled correctly through the class hierarchy."
