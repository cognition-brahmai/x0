For instance, is it feasible to write a predicate that can take a list like this one: `generate_dcg_rule([A,\" is greater than \",B])` and generate a new predicate like this one: `expr(A,\" is greater than \",B) --> symbol(A),\" is greater than \",symbol(B)`?"

        "content": "Yes, it is certainly possible to implement adaptive parsing in Prolog by dynamically generating and modifying parsing rules at runtime. Prolog's flexibility with its predicates and the use of DCG (Definite Clause Grammars) makes it a suitable choice for such tasks. Here's a high-level approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Dynamic Predicate Creation**: Prolog allows you to assert and retract rules dynamically using built-in predicates such as `assert/1`, `asserta/1`, `assertz/1`, and `retract/1`. You can use these to create new predicates or modify existing ones at runtime.\n\n2. **DCG Rule Generation**: To generate DCG rules dynamically, you can create a meta-predicate that constructs the rule as a Prolog term and then asserts it. Specifically, you can construct the DCG rule in the format you desire and assert it into the Prolog database.\n\nHere is a basic example to illustrate this concept:\n\n```prolog\n:- dynamic expr/3.\n\n% Predicate to generate a new DCG rule based on input list\ngenerate_dcg_rule([A, \" is greater than \", B]) :-\n    % Construct the DCG rule as a Prolog term\n    Rule = (expr(A, \" is greater than \", B) --> symbol(A), \" is greater than \", symbol(B)),\n    % Assert the rule into the database\n    assertz(Rule).\n\n% Example symbol/3 predicate for demonstration\nsymbol(A) --> [A].\n\n% Usage Example\n% ?- generate_dcg_rule([X, \" is greater than \", Y]).\n% ?- phrase(expr(X, \" is greater than \", Y), [5, \" is greater than \", 3]).\n```\n\n3. **Considerations**: When implementing adaptive parsing, consider the following:\n   - Manage the dynamic predicates carefully to avoid conflicts and ensure they are correctly defined.\n   - Keep track of which predicates have been asserted to maintain consistency.\n   - Use retracting predicates if certain rules need to be removed or replaced.\n\n4. **Extending Functionality**: You can extend this approach to handle more complex parsing rules and conditions, making your parser more adaptive and capable of handling varying inputs and structures.\n\nBy leveraging Prolog's dynamic features, you can build a flexible parser that adapts to new conditions or syntax during runtime, which can be particularly useful in applications requiring on-the-fly modifications to parsing logic."
