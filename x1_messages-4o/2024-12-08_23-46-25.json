        "content": "To make the prediction more challenging and require logical reasoning, you can introduce non-linear relationships and interaction effects among the factors (texture, composition, and temperature). You can also incorporate additional features that require transformation or domain-specific knowledge. Here's how you can modify the code:\n\n1. **Introduce Non-linear Relationships:** Use polynomial terms or splines to capture non-linear relationships between the predictors and tire wear.\n\n2. **Add Interaction Terms:** Include interactions between the features to capture the combined effects on tire wear.\n\n3. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features based on domain knowledge, like combining texture and temperature to assess their joint effect.\n\n4. **Use a More Complex Model:** Instead of a simple linear model, you can use regression trees, random forests, or boosted trees to capture complex patterns.\n\nHere's an updated version of the code incorporating these ideas:\n\n```r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(caret)\nlibrary(splines)\nlibrary(randomForest)\n\n# Load data\nroad_data <- read_csv(\"road_surface_data.csv\")\ntire_wear_data <- read_csv(\"tire_wear_data.csv\")\n\n# Merge datasets\nmerged_data <- merge(road_data, tire_wear_data, by = \"road_surface_id\")\n\n# Feature engineering: create interaction and non-linear terms\nmerged_data <- merged_data %>%\n  mutate(texture_temp_interaction = texture * temperature,\n         composition_squared = composition^2,\n         temperature_log = log(temperature + 1))\n\n# Model formula with interaction and non-linear terms\nmodel_formula <- formula(tire_wear ~ ns(texture, df = 3) + \n                                        composition_squared + \n                                        temperature_log + \n                                        texture_temp_interaction)\n\n# Split data into training and testing sets\nset.seed(123)\ntrain_index <- createDataPartition(merged_data$tire_wear, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)\ntrain_data <- merged_data[train_index,]\ntest_data <- merged_data[-train_index,]\n\n# Use Random Forest to capture complex patterns\nmodel <- randomForest(model_formula, data = train_data, ntree = 100)\n\n# Make predictions and calculate MSE\npredictions <- predict(model, newdata = test_data)\nmse <- mean((predictions - test_data$tire_wear)^2)\nprint(paste(\"Model mean squared error:\", mse))\n```\n\n**Key Changes:**\n- **Non-linear terms**: Added polynomial and spline terms for texture.\n- **Interaction term**: Introduced an interaction term between texture and temperature.\n- **Non-linear transformations**: Applied a logarithmic transformation to temperature.\n- **Complex Model**: Switched from linear regression to a Random Forest model to better capture non-linear and interaction effects.\n\nThese changes introduce complexity and require logical reasoning to understand how each factor and their interactions contribute to tire wear."
