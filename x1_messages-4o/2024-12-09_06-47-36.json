One of the files contains the following:\n\n```\nMINIENTREGA_FECHALIMITE=\"2011-03-31\"\nMINIENTREGA_FICHEROS=\"informe.txt programa.c\"\nMINIENTREGA_DESTINO=\"./destino/entrega-prac1\"\n```\n\nThis file is stored in `./conf/prac1`. My script, named `minientrega.sh`, attempts to parse the file using the following code:\n\n```\ncat ./conf/$1 | while read line; do\n    export $line\ndone\n```\n\nHowever, when I execute `minientrega.sh prac1` from the command line, the environment variables are not being set. I've also tried using the `source ./conf/$1` command but encounter the same issue. How can I successfully export a set of key/value pairs from a text file into the shell environment?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the way the `while read line` loop is executed in a subshell, which means that any changes to environment variables within the loop do not persist outside of it. Here are a few methods to solve this problem:\n\n### Method 1: Use `source` directly\n\nIf your configuration file follows the correct syntax (as it seems to), using `source` (or `.` which is a synonym for `source`) is the most straightforward approach. You mentioned you've tried `source ./conf/$1`, but if it's not working, make sure that:\n\n1. The file is executable and has the correct permissions.\n2. The file path is correct and accessible from where the script is being executed.\n\nTry running this command directly in your terminal to see if there are any syntax errors:\n\n```bash\nsource ./conf/prac1\n```\n\n### Method 2: Inline `while` loop\n\nIf you prefer using a `while` loop, you can avoid subshells by using a different approach:\n\n```bash\nwhile IFS= read -r line; do\n    eval \"export $line\"\ndone < ./conf/$1\n```\n\n### Method 3: Use `envsubst`\n\nIf the variables are already formatted correctly in the file, you might consider using `envsubst` to substitute environment variables. However, this is more useful for template files that you want to convert using existing environment variables, so it might not apply directly here unless you are using variable placeholders.\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n- Ensure that `./conf/prac1` is formatted correctly as a shell script with no syntax errors.\n- Check if any characters like carriage returns (`\\r`) from Windows line endings are present. You can fix this with `dos2unix ./conf/prac1`.\n- Print debug information in your script to ensure the correct file and path are being used.\n\nWith these methods, you should be able to successfully export the variables from your configuration file into your shell environment."
