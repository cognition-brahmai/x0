However, I am trying to move the code to AWS Lambda using Boto3. I have written the following Lambda function, but I get an error message saying \"USER_PASSWORD_AUTH flow not enabled for this client\". I have tried both initiate_auth and admin_initiate_auth methods. How can I resolve this?\n\nHere is my code for Lambda using initiate_auth:\n\n```python\nimport boto3\n\ndef lambda_handler(event, context):\n    client = boto3.client('cognito-idp')\n    response = client.initiate_auth(\n        ClientId='xxxxxxxxxxxxxx',\n        AuthFlow='USER_PASSWORD_AUTH',\n        AuthParameters={\n            'USERNAME': 'xxxxxx',\n            'PASSWORD': 'xxxxxx'\n        }\n    )\n    return response\n```\n\nAnd for initiate_auth:\n\n```python\nimport boto3\ndef lambda_handler(event, context):\n    client = boto3.client('cognito-idp')\n    response = client.initiate_auth(\n        UserPoolId='xxxxxxxxx',\n        ClientId='xxxxxxxxxxxxxx',\n        AuthFlow='USER_PASSWORD_AUTH',\n        AuthParameters={\n            'USERNAME': 'xxxxxx',\n            'PASSWORD': 'xxxxxx'\n        }\n    )\n    return response\n```\n\nAnd here is the error I am receiving:\n\n```python\nAn error occurred (InvalidParameterException) when calling the\nInitiateAuth operation: USER_PASSWORD_AUTH flow not enabled for this\nclient: InvalidParameterException Traceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"/var/task/lambda_function.py\", line 12, in lambda_handler\n  'PASSWORD': 'xxxxx'   File \"/var/runtime/botocore/client.py\", line 317, in _api_call\n  return self._make_api_call(operation_name, kwargs)   File \"/var/runtime/botocore/client.py\", line 615, in _make_api_call\n  raise error_class(parsed_response, operation_name) InvalidParameterException: An error occurred\n(InvalidParameterException) when calling the InitiateAuth operation:\nUSER_PASSWORD_AUTH flow not enabled for this client\n```"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering indicates that the `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` flow is not enabled for your Cognito User Pool client. To resolve this issue, you'll need to enable the `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` authentication flow for the client associated with your User Pool. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Navigate to the Amazon Cognito Console:**\n   - Go to the AWS Management Console.\n   - Navigate to the Amazon Cognito service.\n\n2. **Select the User Pool:**\n   - Click on the User Pool that your application is using.\n\n3. **Configure App Client Settings:**\n   - In the User Pool settings, go to the \"App clients\" section.\n   - Select the App client that you are using (the one with the `ClientId` you specified in your Lambda function).\n\n4. **Edit the App Client Settings:**\n   - Click on \"Show details\" next to the App client.\n   - Click on \"Edit\" to modify the App client settings.\n\n5. **Enable USER_PASSWORD_AUTH:**\n   - In the \"Authentication flow settings\" section, ensure that \"Enable username and password authentication (USER_PASSWORD_AUTH)\" is checked.\n   - Save the changes.\n\n6. **Verify and Test:**\n   - After enabling the authentication flow, test your Lambda function again to ensure that the issue is resolved.\n\nAdditionally, make sure that your `AuthParameters` are correctly specified and that your Lambda function is correctly set up with the necessary permissions to access Cognito. If you continue to experience issues, double-check the `ClientId` and `UserPoolId` to ensure they are correct and correspond to the intended resources."
