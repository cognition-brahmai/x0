The list must include not only the basic functions such as login, registration, search, cart, checkout, payment, and delivery tracking, but also additional features that can enhance user experience. Furthermore, the application should be compatible with both iOS and Android devices, and its interface must be user-friendly with an intuitive design. To ensure the successful completion of the project, the requirements list should also contain a feature that enables customers to rate and review their delivery experience in a seamless manner. Can you provide a more comprehensive and specific list of key features that should be included in the requirements list for this mobile web application?"
