        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to compatibility issues between certain versions of NumPy and the Windows runtime environment. This is a known issue and can be resolved by ensuring you're using compatible versions of NumPy and Matplotlib. Here's how you can address this problem:\n\n1. **Update Pip and Setuptools**: First, make sure your `pip` and `setuptools` are up to date. Run the following commands:\n\n   ```shell\n   python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools\n   ```\n\n2. **Install a Compatible Version of NumPy**: Sometimes installing a specific version of NumPy can resolve compatibility issues. You might want to try installing NumPy version 1.19, which is often compatible with Python 3.9:\n\n   ```shell\n   pip install numpy==1.19.3\n   ```\n\n3. **Install Matplotlib**: After you have installed the compatible version of NumPy, proceed to install Matplotlib:\n\n   ```shell\n   pip install matplotlib\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for Environment Activation**: Ensure that your virtual environment is correctly activated. In PowerShell, activation might require:\n\n   ```shell\n   .\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1\n   ```\n\n5. **Use PyCharm's Built-in Tools**: If you're using PyCharm, you can manage your virtual environment and package installations through the PyCharm interface:\n\n   - Go to `File` > `Settings` (or `PyCharm` > `Preferences` on macOS).\n   - Navigate to `Project: <Your_Project_Name>` > `Python Interpreter`.\n   - Here, you can manage packages and ensure the correct versions are installed.\n\n6. **Consider Using a Conda Environment**: If the problem persists, consider using a Conda environment, which can handle package dependencies more gracefully:\n\n   ```shell\n   conda create --name myenv python=3.9\n   conda activate myenv\n   conda install numpy matplotlib\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the RuntimeError and successfully install Matplotlib in your environment. If you continue to experience issues, please let me know, and we can explore further solutions."
