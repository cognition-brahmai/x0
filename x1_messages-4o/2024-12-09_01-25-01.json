You should write it as follows:\n\n```\nprotobuf --no-binary=protobuf\n```\n\nThis line in your `requirements.txt` file tells `pip` to install the `protobuf` package without using pre-built binary distributions (wheels), similar to what the command `pip install --no-binary=protobuf protobuf` does.\n\nWhen you run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, it will interpret this line with the specified option and install the `protobuf` package from source."
