        "content": "In the context of CUDA programming, there isn't a formal or universally agreed-upon naming convention specifically for CUDA-specific header files. However, developers often adopt certain practices to help distinguish them from standard C/C++ header files. Here are some common approaches:\n\n1. **File Extension**: While the source files typically have a `.cu` extension, header files usually retain the standard `.h` or `.hpp` extensions. However, some developers choose to use `.cuh` to indicate that the header file contains CUDA-specific declarations.\n\n2. **File Naming**: Some projects may include \"cuda\" or \"cu\" in the filename to indicate that the header is CUDA-related. For instance, `vector_operations_cuda.h` or `vector_operations.cuh`.\n\n3. **Comments and Documentation**: Clearly documenting within the file that it contains CUDA code can also help differentiate it. This might include comments at the top of the file or using doxygen-style documentation.\n\n4. **Directory Structure**: Organizing CUDA-specific headers in dedicated directories (e.g., `include/cuda/`) can also help distinguish them from other headers.\n\nUltimately, the most important aspect is consistency within a project or team, ensuring that everyone understands and follows the chosen conventions."
