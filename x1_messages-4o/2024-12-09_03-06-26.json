Here is the script I am using:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport os\nfrom os import listdir\n\ntest=os.listdir(\"/Users/ben/downloads/\")\n\nfor item in test:\n    if item.endswith(\".zip\"):\n        os.remove(item)\n```\n\nWhen I run this script, I get the following error:\n\n```python\nOSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'cities1000.zip'\n```\n\nThe file 'cities1000.zip' does indeed exist in my downloads folder. Is the issue perhaps that the os.remove function requires the full path to the file? If so, how can I modify my script to provide the full path without completely rewriting it?"

        "content": "Yes, the issue you're encountering is because `os.remove()` requires the full path to the file. When you use `os.listdir()`, it returns just the filenames, not their full paths. Therefore, when trying to remove a file, you need to provide the full path.\n\nYou can modify your script to include the full path by joining the directory path with the filename. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Define the path to your downloads folder\ndownloads_folder = \"/Users/ben/downloads/\"\n\n# List all files in the downloads folder\nfiles_in_downloads = os.listdir(downloads_folder)\n\n# Iterate over each file in the folder\nfor item in files_in_downloads:\n    # Check if the file ends with '.zip'\n    if item.endswith(\".zip\"):\n        # Create the full path to the file\n        file_path = os.path.join(downloads_folder, item)\n        \n        # Remove the file\n        os.remove(file_path)\n```\n\nThis script uses `os.path.join()` to concatenate the folder path and the filename, ensuring that `os.remove()` receives the full path it needs to locate and delete the file."
