I have a statement in one of my unit test methods that queries a database:\n\n```python\ndb_employees = self.db._session.query(Employee).filter(Employee.dept == new_employee.dept).all()\n```\n\nI want to mock `db_employees` to get a list of employee objects. I tried doing this with:\n\n```python\nm = MagickMock()\nm.return_value.filter().all().return_value = employees\n```\n\nBut it did not work. When I try to print the value of any attribute, it has a mock value. My code looks something like this:\n\n```python\nclass Database(object):\n    def __init__(self, user=None, passwd=None, db=\"sqlite:////tmp/emp.db\"):\n        try:\n            engine = create_engine(db)\n        except Exception:\n            raise ValueError(\"Database '%s' does not exist.\" % db)\n\n        def on_connect(conn, record):\n            conn.execute('pragma foreign_keys=ON')\n\n        if 'sqlite://' in db:\n            event.listen(engine, 'connect', on_connect)\n        Base.metadata.bind = engine\n        DBSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\n        self._session = DBSession()\n\n\nclass TestEmployee(MyEmployee):\n    def setUp(self):\n        self.db = emp.database.Database(db=options.connection)\n        self.db._session._autoflush()\n\n    @mock.patch.object(session.Session, 'add')     \n    @mock.patch.object(session.Session, 'query')  \n    def test_update(self, mock_query, mock_add):\n        employees = [{'id': 1,\n                      'name': 'Pradeep',\n                      'department': 'IT',\n                      'manager': 'John'}]\n        mock_add.side_effect = self.add_side_effect\n        mock_query.return_value = self.query_results()  \n        self.update_employees(employees)\n\n    def add_side_effect(self, instance, _warn=True):\n        // Code to mock add\n        // Values will be stored in a dict which will be used to \n        // check with expected value.\n\n    def query_results(self):  \n        m = MagicMock()  \n        if self.count == 0:  \n             m.return_value.filter.return_value.all.return_value = [employee]  \n        elif:  \n             m.return_value.filter.return_value.all.return_value = [department]  \n        return m  \n```\n\nI have `query_results` as the method under test calls query twice. First the employee table and next the department table. How can I mock this chained function call?"

        "content": "Mocking chained function calls can be a bit tricky, but it's definitely possible with Python's `unittest.mock` library. You seem to be on the right track, but let's refine your approach to ensure your mocks are correctly set up.\n\nThe key is to mock each part of the chain individually and ensure that each mock returns the next mock in the chain. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Mock the Query Method**: You need to mock the `query` method to return a mock that can handle the subsequent method calls (`filter`, `all`, etc.).\n\n2. **Set Return Values for Each Method in the Chain**: Make sure each method in the chain returns a mock that has the next method in the chain set up.\n\nHere's a refined version of your test:\n\n```python\nfrom unittest import TestCase, mock\nfrom unittest.mock import MagicMock\n\nclass TestEmployee(TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        self.db = emp.database.Database(db=options.connection)\n        self.db._session._autoflush()\n\n    @mock.patch.object(session.Session, 'add')     \n    @mock.patch.object(session.Session, 'query')  \n    def test_update(self, mock_query, mock_add):\n        # Mock data\n        employees = [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Pradeep', 'department': 'IT', 'manager': 'John'}]\n        \n        # Mock query chain\n        mock_query_instance = mock_query.return_value\n        mock_filter = MagicMock()\n        mock_query_instance.filter.return_value = mock_filter\n        mock_filter.all.return_value = employees\n        \n        # Mock add side effect\n        mock_add.side_effect = self.add_side_effect\n        \n        # Call the method under test\n        self.update_employees(employees)\n\n    def add_side_effect(self, instance, _warn=True):\n        # Code to mock add\n        # Values will be stored in a dict to check with expected values.\n        pass\n\n    def update_employees(self, employees):\n        # Implementation of update_employees\n        pass\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Mock the `query` Method**: `mock_query` is mocked to return `mock_query_instance`, which is another `MagicMock`.\n\n- **Chained Calls**: `mock_query_instance.filter.return_value` is set to another `MagicMock`, `mock_filter`, which then has its `all` method's return value set to `employees`.\n\n- **Multiple Chains**: If your method calls `query` twice (once for employees, once for departments), you can differentiate the behavior by using side effects or conditions within your mocked method. Here, it's assumed that the `filter` method will handle this part.\n\n- **Use Side Effects for Conditional Logic**: If the behavior of `query` changes based on conditions (e.g., first call, second call), use `side_effect` to define different behaviors for each subsequent call.\n\nThis setup should correctly mock the chain of method calls and allow you to test the `update_employees` method without hitting a real database. Adjust the return values and logic as needed based on the specific behavior of your method."
