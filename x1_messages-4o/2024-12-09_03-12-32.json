However, this code is producing two separate plots, one for each class. How can I modify this code to force one plot with both classes in the same plot?"

        "content": "To create a single plot with both classes on the same plot using a kernel density estimate (KDE) in Pandas, you'll want to use the `seaborn` library or directly use Matplotlib after grouping the data. Here's how you can do it using both approaches:\n\n### Using Seaborn\n\nSeaborn is a Python visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics. It's particularly well-suited for creating KDE plots.\n\n```python\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Assuming 'p_df' is your DataFrame and 'class' is the column you want to group by\nsns.kdeplot(data=p_df, x='your_variable', hue='class')\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- Replace `'your_variable'` with the column name of the variable you want to plot.\n- The `hue` parameter is used to specify the column that determines the color of the plot, which in this case is `'class'`.\n\n### Using Matplotlib\n\nIf you want to stick with Matplotlib, you can achieve a similar effect by iterating over the groups manually:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Group the data by 'class'\ngrouped = p_df.groupby('class')\n\n# Plot each group on the same plot\nfor name, group in grouped:\n    group['your_variable'].plot(kind='kde', label=name)\n\nplt.legend(title='Class')\nplt.xlabel('your_variable')  # Label for the x-axis\nplt.title('KDE Plot of your_variable by Class')  # Title of the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- Replace `'your_variable'` with the column name of the variable you want to plot.\n- The `label=name` ensures that each class gets a label in the legend.\n- `plt.legend()` and `plt.xlabel()` are used to add a legend and label the x-axis, respectively.\n\nThese approaches should give you a single plot with different classes represented by different colors or lines."
