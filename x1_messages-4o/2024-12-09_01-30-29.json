Can someone help me understand what's causing this error and how to fix it? Here's the script that's causing the error:\n\n```bash\nelif [ $operation = \"man\" ]; then\n    if [ $aug1 = \"add\" ]; then         # <- Line 75\n    echo \"Man Page for: add\";\n    echo \"\";\n    echo \"Syntax: add [number 1] [number 2]\";\n    echo \"\";\n    echo \"Description:\";\n    echo \"Add two different numbers together.\";\n    echo \"\";\n    echo \"Info:\";\n    echo \"Added in v1.0\";\n    echo \"\";\nelif [ -z $aug1 ]; then\n    echo \"Please specify a command to read the man page.\";\nelse\n    echo \"There is no manual page for that command.\";\nfi\n```\n\nAnd here's the error message I'm getting:\n\n```bash\ncalc_1.2: line 75: [: =: unary operator expected\n```"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering, \"unary operator expected,\" typically occurs when one or both of the variables in a test expression are not properly initialized or quoted, leading to an empty value being evaluated. In your script, this happens at the line:\n\n```bash\nif [ $aug1 = \"add\" ]; then\n```\n\nIf `$aug1` is empty or unset, the test expression becomes `[ = \"add\" ]`, which is syntactically incorrect because the left side of the `=` operator is missing. To fix this, you should quote the variable to ensure that the test expression is valid even when the variable is empty. Here's the corrected line:\n\n```bash\nif [ \"$aug1\" = \"add\" ]; then\n```\n\nBy quoting `$aug1`, you prevent the test expression from failing due to an empty or unset variable. It's a good practice to always quote your variables in test expressions to avoid similar issues. Here's the corrected version of the relevant section of your script:\n\n```bash\nelif [ \"$operation\" = \"man\" ]; then\n    if [ \"$aug1\" = \"add\" ]; then\n        echo \"Man Page for: add\";\n        echo \"\";\n        echo \"Syntax: add [number 1] [number 2]\";\n        echo \"\";\n        echo \"Description:\";\n        echo \"Add two different numbers together.\";\n        echo \"\";\n        echo \"Info:\";\n        echo \"Added in v1.0\";\n        echo \"\";\n    elif [ -z \"$aug1\" ]; then\n        echo \"Please specify a command to read the man page.\";\n    else\n        echo \"There is no manual page for that command.\";\n    fi\n```\n\nThis should resolve the error you're experiencing."
