        "content": "To determine the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of a substance, you can use the formula for specific heat capacity:\n\n\\[ Q = mc\\Delta T \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( Q \\) is the heat energy absorbed or released (in joules),\n- \\( m \\) is the mass of the substance (in grams),\n- \\( c \\) is the specific heat capacity of the substance (in joules per gram per kelvin, J/g\u00b7K),\n- \\(\\Delta T\\) is the change in temperature (in kelvin, K).\n\nIn your case:\n- \\( m = 100 \\, \\text{g} \\),\n- \\(\\Delta T = 293 \\, \\text{K} - 273 \\, \\text{K} = 20 \\, \\text{K} \\).\n\nThe specific heat capacity (\\( c \\)) will depend on the substance in question. Once you know the specific heat capacity, you can plug in the values into the formula to find \\( Q \\).\n\nFor example, if the specific heat capacity of the substance is \\( c = 4.18 \\, \\text{J/g\u00b7K} \\) (which is the specific heat capacity for water), the calculation would be:\n\n\\[ Q = 100 \\, \\text{g} \\times 4.18 \\, \\text{J/g\u00b7K} \\times 20 \\, \\text{K} \\]\n\n\\[ Q = 8360 \\, \\text{J} \\]\n\nSo, 8360 joules of energy would be required to raise the temperature of 100 g of this substance from 273 K to 293 K. You will need the specific heat capacity of the actual substance to perform the calculation accurately."
