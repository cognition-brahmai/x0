I have successfully managed to import the data using the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom google.colab import files\nuploaded = files.upload()\n```\n\nHowever, I am having trouble converting the dictionary `uploaded` into a dataframe. I have tried using the `from_dict` command but it does not seem to be working. How can I convert a locally stored CSV file into a pandas dataframe on Google Colaboratory?"

        "content": "After you have successfully uploaded the CSV file using `files.upload()`, you can convert it into a pandas DataFrame by following these steps:\n\n1. Import the necessary library:\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n   ```\n\n2. Use the uploaded file's key to read it into a DataFrame. The `uploaded` dictionary contains the filename as the key and the file data as the value. You can use `pd.read_csv()` to read the CSV file:\n\n   ```python\n   # Get the filename\n   filename = list(uploaded.keys())[0]\n\n   # Read the CSV file into a DataFrame\n   df = pd.read_csv(filename)\n   ```\n\n3. Now, you can work with the DataFrame `df` just like any other pandas DataFrame.\n\nHere's the complete code snippet:\n\n```python\nfrom google.colab import files\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Upload the file\nuploaded = files.upload()\n\n# Get the filename\nfilename = list(uploaded.keys())[0]\n\n# Read the CSV file into a DataFrame\ndf = pd.read_csv(filename)\n\n# Display the first few rows of the DataFrame\nprint(df.head())\n```\n\nThis code will upload your CSV file, read it into a pandas DataFrame, and then display the first few rows of the DataFrame."
