        "content": "To uninstall `pyenv` from your Mac, especially if you installed it using Homebrew, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Uninstall pyenv using Homebrew:**\n   Open your Terminal and run the following command to uninstall `pyenv`:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew uninstall pyenv\n   ```\n\n   This will remove the `pyenv` package from your system.\n\n2. **Remove pyenv configuration from your shell profile:**\n   You likely added some lines to your shell configuration file (such as `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, etc.) to initialize `pyenv`. Open the corresponding file in a text editor and remove or comment out these lines. They usually look something like this:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=\"$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH\"\n   eval \"$(pyenv init --path)\"\n   eval \"$(pyenv init -)\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Remove pyenv directory:**\n   The default directory for `pyenv` is `~/.pyenv`. You can remove it by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   rm -rf ~/.pyenv\n   ```\n\n   This will delete all versions of Python that were installed via `pyenv`.\n\n4. **Restart your terminal:**\n   After making these changes, close your terminal and open it again to apply the changes.\n\nNow that you've uninstalled `pyenv`, you can proceed with installing Anaconda. Make sure to follow the official Anaconda installation instructions to set it up correctly on your system."
