I am looking for a comprehensive list of all such events, including the names for the various keyboard keys. I've checked the Tcl bind manual but it doesn't have this information. Where can I find this list?"

        "content": "In Tkinter, the event binding mechanism allows you to capture various user interactions with widgets. Here's a list of some common event patterns that you can use in Tkinter:\n\n### Mouse Events\n- `<Button-1>`: Left mouse button click\n- `<Button-2>`: Middle mouse button click (usually the scroll wheel)\n- `<Button-3>`: Right mouse button click\n- `<Double-Button-1>`: Double click with the left mouse button\n- `<Triple-Button-1>`: Triple click with the left mouse button\n- `<B1-Motion>`: Mouse movement while holding down the left button\n- `<B2-Motion>`: Mouse movement while holding down the middle button\n- `<B3-Motion>`: Mouse movement while holding down the right button\n- `<Enter>`: Mouse enters the widget area\n- `<Leave>`: Mouse leaves the widget area\n- `<Motion>`: Mouse movement within the widget area\n- `<MouseWheel>`: Scroll wheel movement (on Windows)\n- `<Button-4>` and `<Button-5>`: Scroll wheel up and down (on some systems)\n\n### Keyboard Events\n- `<KeyPress>` or `<Key>`: Any key press\n- `<KeyRelease>`: Any key release\n- `<KeyPress-a>` or `<a>`: Pressing the 'a' key\n- `<KeyPress-A>`: Pressing the 'A' key (case-sensitive)\n- `<Return>`: Enter key\n- `<Escape>`: Escape key\n- `<BackSpace>`: Backspace key\n- `<Tab>`: Tab key\n- `<Shift_L>` and `<Shift_R>`: Left and right Shift keys\n- `<Control_L>` and `<Control_R>`: Left and right Control keys\n- `<Alt_L>` and `<Alt_R>`: Left and right Alt keys\n- `<F1>`, `<F2>`, ..., `<F12>`: Function keys F1 to F12\n- `<Home>`, `<End>`, `<Page_Up>`, `<Page_Down>`: Navigation keys\n- `<Left>`, `<Right>`, `<Up>`, `<Down>`: Arrow keys\n\n### Focus Events\n- `<FocusIn>`: Widget gains focus\n- `<FocusOut>`: Widget loses focus\n\n### Window Events\n- `<Configure>`: Window is resized or moved\n- `<Activate>`: Window becomes the active window\n- `<Deactivate>`: Window is no longer the active window\n- `<Map>`: Widget or window is mapped to the screen\n- `<Unmap>`: Widget or window is unmapped from the screen\n- `<Expose>`: Part of the window needs to be redrawn\n\nThese events can be used with the `bind` method to trigger functions or methods in response to user interactions. For more detailed information, you might want to check the Tkinter documentation or resources like online tutorials and guides that go into specifics about event handling in Tkinter."
