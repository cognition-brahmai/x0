Currently, in my code, the output is sent to the screen and the value printed for the variable is 0, which I think signifies whether the command ran successfully or not. Here is the code I am working with:\n\n```python\nvar = os.system(\"cat /etc/services\")\nprint(var) #Prints 0\n```\n\nIs there a way to assign the command output to the variable and also stop it from being displayed on the screen?"

        "content": "The `os.system` function in Python is primarily used to execute a command in a subshell, and it only returns the exit status of the command, not the output. To capture the output of a command and prevent it from being displayed on the screen, you can use the `subprocess` module, which provides more powerful facilities for spawning new processes and retrieving their results.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\n# Capture the output of the command\nresult = subprocess.run([\"cat\", \"/etc/services\"], capture_output=True, text=True)\n\n# Assign the command output to a variable\nvar = result.stdout\n\n# Print the output\nprint(var)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what each part does:\n\n- `subprocess.run()` is used to execute the command. It takes a list of arguments, where each element is a part of the command.\n- `capture_output=True` captures the output, both `stdout` and `stderr`.\n- `text=True` makes sure that the output is returned as a string (text mode) instead of bytes.\n\nThis way, the command output is captured in the `var` variable, and it won't be displayed on the screen unless you explicitly print it."
