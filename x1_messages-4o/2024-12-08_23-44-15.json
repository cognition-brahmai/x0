If you enjoyed \"The Hunger Games,\" you might like \"Battle Royale.\" It's a Japanese film directed by Kinji Fukasaku, featuring a group of high school students who are forced to compete in a deadly game. Another option is \"Divergent,\" which follows a young female protagonist in a dystopian future who challenges the societal norms. Both films offer intense action and strong female leads."
