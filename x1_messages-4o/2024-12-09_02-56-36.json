Previously, I have used the following regular expressions to remove the data:\n\n```\nre.sub(r'\\([^)]*\\)', '', filename)\nre.sub(r'\\(.*?\\)', '', filename)\n```\n\nHowever, when trying to use them, I get an error stating \"expected a string or buffer\". When I attempt to use the specific column `df['Column Name']`, I get another error saying \"no item named 'Column Name'\". Even though the dataframe appears to be fine when I use `df.head()`, it seems to be not recognizing the column name when I try to use the `re` expression to remove the parentheses and the content inside them. Normally, I use `df['name'].str.replace(\" ()\",\"\")` to achieve this, but this time I want to remove the parentheses along with what's inside. How can I achieve this using either regex or pandas?"

        "content": "To remove all parentheses along with the text inside them from a specific column in a pandas DataFrame, you can use the `str.replace` method in combination with a regular expression. The errors you're encountering are likely due to incorrect handling of the DataFrame or its columns. Here's how you can achieve your goal:\n\n1. Ensure the column name is correct and exists in your DataFrame.\n2. Use `str.replace` with a regular expression to remove the parentheses and their contents.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport re\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {'Column Name': ['example (text)', 'another example (more text)', 'no parentheses here']}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Ensure the column name is correct\ncolumn_name = 'Column Name'\n\n# Check if the column exists in the DataFrame\nif column_name in df.columns:\n    # Use str.replace with regex to remove parentheses and the text inside\n    df[column_name] = df[column_name].str.replace(r'\\([^)]*\\)', '', regex=True)\nelse:\n    print(f\"No column named '{column_name}' found.\")\n\n# Display the updated DataFrame\nprint(df)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We're using `str.replace` on the specific column. The `regex=True` argument is important as it tells pandas to interpret the pattern as a regular expression.\n- `r'\\([^)]*\\)'` is the regex pattern used to match any text inside parentheses, including the parentheses themselves.\n\nThis should work without any issues as long as the column name is correctly specified and exists in your DataFrame. If you continue to experience errors, double-check the column names and ensure your DataFrame is being read correctly."
