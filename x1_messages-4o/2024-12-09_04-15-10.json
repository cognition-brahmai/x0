The application runs perfectly when using the Django command `python manage.py runserver`. I have installed Gunicorn using pip (`pip install gunicorn`) and my Django version is 1.5.3. However, when I run the command `gunicorn  hello.wsgi:application -b xx.xxx.xxx.xx:8000` inside the virtual environment, I encounter the error `gunicorn.errors.HaltServer: <HaltServer 'Worker failed to boot.' 3>`. What is causing this error and how can I fix it?"

        "content": "The error `gunicorn.errors.HaltServer: <HaltServer 'Worker failed to boot.' 3>` indicates that Gunicorn is unable to start the worker processes for your Django application. This can be caused by several issues. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the problem:\n\n1. **Check for Syntax Errors:** Ensure that there are no syntax errors in your Django application, especially in the `wsgi.py` file. Even a small typo could cause the worker to fail.\n\n2. **Verify the WSGI Path:** Make sure that the path you are providing to Gunicorn is correct. The format `hello.wsgi:application` assumes that you have a Django app located in a directory called `hello` and that there is a `wsgi.py` file inside it with an `application` callable. Ensure this path is correct.\n\n3. **Check for Application-specific Errors:** Run your application directly using the Django development server (`python manage.py runserver`) and check the logs for any application-specific errors that may not have been obvious before.\n\n4. **Inspect Gunicorn Logs:** Gunicorn should provide more detailed logs about why the worker failed to boot. Run Gunicorn with the `--log-level=debug` option to get more verbose output:\n   ```bash\n   gunicorn hello.wsgi:application -b xx.xxx.xxx.xx:8000 --log-level=debug\n   ```\n   Look for any error messages that could provide more insight into the problem.\n\n5. **Check Dependencies:** Ensure that all the dependencies required by your Django application are installed in your virtual environment. Missing dependencies can cause the application to fail to start.\n\n6. **Environment Variables:** Make sure that any necessary environment variables (e.g., `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`, database credentials) are set correctly in your environment or passed to Gunicorn.\n\n7. **Python Version Compatibility:** Since you're using Django 1.5.3, ensure that your Python version is compatible with this Django version. Django 1.5.3 is quite old and may not work with newer Python versions.\n\n8. **Inspect Configuration Files:** If you're using any configuration files (e.g., `settings.py`, `.env` files), ensure that they are correctly configured and accessible.\n\nIf you've checked all the above and the problem persists, try creating a minimal Django project to see if Gunicorn can run it. This can help isolate whether the issue is with the specific application or the Gunicorn setup."
