Is it possible or recommended to use both methods in one class? Can the properties be defined in the following ways?\n\nMethod 1:\n```python\n@property\ndef total(self):\n    return self.field_1 + self.field_2\n```\nMethod 2:\n```python\ntotal = property(lambda self: self.field_1 + self.field_2)\n```"

        "content": "In Python, both methods you mentioned can be used to define class properties, but they each have their own use cases and readability considerations. Let's explore both:\n\n### Method 1: Using the `@property` decorator\n```python\n@property\ndef total(self):\n    return self.field_1 + self.field_2\n```\n- **Readability**: This method is generally more readable and is the preferred way to create properties, especially for more complex logic. It clearly separates the getter logic and can easily be extended to include setters and deleters using `@method_name.setter` and `@method_name.deleter`.\n- **Flexibility**: It allows for the property to be expanded with additional logic without changing the interface.\n- **Maintainability**: It is easier to maintain as the complexity grows, because the code is more explicit.\n\n### Method 2: Using a `lambda` function\n```python\ntotal = property(lambda self: self.field_1 + self.field_2)\n```\n- **Conciseness**: This method is more concise and might be suitable for simple one-liner properties.\n- **Readability**: It might be less readable, especially for those who are not familiar with lambda expressions.\n- **Limitations**: It is more limited in terms of extending functionality. If you need to add a setter or additional logic, you would need to refactor to use the `@property` decorator approach.\n\n### Can Both Methods Be Used in One Class?\nYes, you can use both methods in one class. However, for consistency and readability, it is generally advisable to stick to one method across a class or project unless there's a specific reason to use both.\n\n### Recommendation\n- Use the `@property` decorator for most cases, especially when you anticipate that the property might evolve to include more complex logic or need a setter.\n- Use the `lambda` approach for simple, one-liner properties where brevity is beneficial and there's no need for additional logic.\n\n### Example Combining Both in a Class\nHere's how you might use both in a class, although sticking to one method is usually better:\n\n```python\nclass MyClass:\n    def __init__(self, field_1, field_2):\n        self.field_1 = field_1\n        self.field_2 = field_2\n\n    @property\n    def total(self):\n        return self.field_1 + self.field_2\n\n    simple_total = property(lambda self: self.field_1 + self.field_2)\n```\n\nIn this example, `total` uses the `@property` decorator, while `simple_total` uses a lambda function. Use such combinations judiciously and aim for consistency to improve code maintainability."
