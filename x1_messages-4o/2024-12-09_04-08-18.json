In fact, BeautifulSoup is well-suited for this task and is generally preferred over Regular Expressions for parsing and manipulating HTML. Here's how you can do it using BeautifulSoup in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n# Sample HTML content\nhtml_content = '''\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Sample Page</title>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n        console.log('This is a script.');\n    </script>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>\n    <script>\n        alert('Another script.');\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n'''\n\n# Create a BeautifulSoup object\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')\n\n# Find and remove all <script> tags\nfor script in soup.find_all('script'):\n    script.decompose()\n\n# Print the modified HTML\nprint(soup.prettify())\n```\n\nThis code will remove all `<script>` tags along with their contents from the HTML. The `decompose()` method is used to completely remove the tag from the tree, including its contents. This approach is more reliable than using regular expressions because BeautifulSoup is specifically designed to handle HTML/XML parsing and manipulation."
