        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to a version conflict with the `setuptools` package. Your environment has `setuptools` version 0.6c11 installed, but the requirement is for a version greater than 0.7. To resolve this, you need to upgrade `setuptools` to a compatible version. Here\u2019s how you can do that:\n\n1. **Upgrade Setuptools:**\n\n   First, make sure you have `pip` installed. Then, upgrade `setuptools` using the following command:\n\n   ```shell\n   bin/pip install --upgrade setuptools\n   ```\n\n   If you encounter issues with permissions, you might need to use `sudo` or ensure your virtual environment is activated.\n\n2. **Verify the Installation:**\n\n   After upgrading, verify the installation by checking the version of `setuptools`:\n\n   ```shell\n   bin/python -c \"import setuptools; print(setuptools.__version__)\"\n   ```\n\n   This should return a version number greater than 0.7.\n\n3. **Run Bootstrap Again:**\n\n   Once `setuptools` is upgraded, try running your bootstrap command again:\n\n   ```shell\n   bin/python bootstrap.py -d\n   ```\n\nIf you continue to have issues, it might be helpful to create a fresh virtual environment and install the required packages from scratch. Here's a quick guide on how to do this:\n\n1. **Create a New Virtual Environment:**\n\n   ```shell\n   python -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `myenv\\Scripts\\activate`\n   ```\n\n2. **Reinstall Dependencies:**\n\n   Navigate to your project directory and reinstall the necessary dependencies:\n\n   ```shell\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n3. **Run Bootstrap Again:**\n\n   Execute the bootstrap command in the new environment:\n\n   ```shell\n   python bootstrap.py -d\n   ```\n\nThese steps should help resolve the `VersionConflict` error you're encountering. If problems persist, ensure that all dependencies are compatible with each other by reviewing their versions and constraints in your `requirements.txt` or setup files."
