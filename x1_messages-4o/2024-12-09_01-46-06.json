        "content": "Yes, you can check the syntax of a Python script without executing it by using the `py_compile` module or the `python -m py_compile` command. This compiles the script to bytecode and checks for syntax errors without running the code.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n### Using the Command Line\n\n1. Open a terminal or command prompt.\n2. Run the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m py_compile your_script.py\n   ```\n\nThis command will attempt to compile `your_script.py`. If there are any syntax errors, they will be displayed in the console. If there are no errors, a compiled version of the script (a `.pyc` file) will be created in the `__pycache__` directory.\n\n### Using the `py_compile` Module in a Script\n\nYou can also write a small script to compile another script:\n\n```python\nimport py_compile\n\ntry:\n    py_compile.compile('your_script.py', doraise=True)\n    print(\"Syntax is correct.\")\nexcept py_compile.PyCompileError as compile_err:\n    print(\"Syntax error in script:\", compile_err)\n```\n\nReplace `'your_script.py'` with the path to your Python script. This script will raise an error if there are any syntax issues and print a message if the syntax is correct.\n\nThese methods will help you ensure that your script is syntactically correct without executing its logic."
