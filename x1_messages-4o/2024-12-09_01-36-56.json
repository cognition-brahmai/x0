I want to limit my usage of external libraries to `scipy`, `numpy` and `matplotlib` only. The `imread` function in `scipy` is being deprecated and they recommend using the `imageio` library which I do not want to use. Are there any methods in Python or within the `scipy`, `numpy` or `matplotlib` libraries to read images, which are not being deprecated?"

        "content": "You can read a PNG image using the `matplotlib` library, which provides a convenient way to handle images. Specifically, you can use the `matplotlib.pyplot.imread` function, which can read an image into a NumPy array. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Read the image using matplotlib\nimage = plt.imread('path_to_your_image.png')\n\n# Now `image` is a NumPy array\nprint(type(image))  # Should print <class 'numpy.ndarray'>\nprint(image.shape)  # Check the shape of the image array\n```\n\nThe `plt.imread` function supports various image formats, including PNG, and it returns the image as a NumPy array, which you can then manipulate using NumPy's functionality.\n\nThis method is straightforward and doesn't require additional libraries beyond what's included in `matplotlib`."
