        "content": "To determine the angle formed by the line segment connecting point A with coordinates (3,1) and point B with coordinates (5,3) with respect to the horizontal axis, we can use the concept of vectors and trigonometric functions. Here's a step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Determine the Vector**:  \n   First, find the vector representing the line segment from point A to point B. This is done by subtracting the coordinates of A from B:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Vector } \\overrightarrow{AB} = (x_2 - x_1, y_2 - y_1) = (5 - 3, 3 - 1) = (2, 2)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Magnitude of the Vector**:  \n   The magnitude (or length) of vector \\(\\overrightarrow{AB}\\) is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:\n   \\[\n   |\\overrightarrow{AB}| = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} = \\sqrt{2^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 4} = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the Direction Angle**:  \n   The direction angle \\(\\theta\\) of the vector \\(\\overrightarrow{AB}\\) with respect to the positive x-axis can be found using the tangent function. The tangent of the angle is the ratio of the y-component to the x-component of the vector:\n   \\[\n   \\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Angle**:  \n   To find the angle \\(\\theta\\), take the inverse tangent (arctan) of the tangent value:\n   \\[\n   \\theta = \\tan^{-1}(1)\n   \\]\n   The angle \\(\\theta\\) whose tangent is 1 is \\(45^\\circ\\) (or \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\) radians).\n\nTherefore, the angle formed by the line segment connecting point A with coordinates (3,1) and point B with coordinates (5,3) with respect to the positive x-axis is \\(45^\\circ\\)."
