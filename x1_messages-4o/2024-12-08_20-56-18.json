Then, use the same letters to rearrange and generate the name of a prominent alumna from that university who has played a crucial role in the field of medical research. This exercise requires a keen eye for detail and strong problem-solving skills."

Here's how you could structure the HTML code:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>University Acronym and Alumna</title>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n            margin: 20px;\n        }\n        .acronym, .alumna {\n            font-weight: bold;\n            color: navy;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n    <h1>California-based University Exercise</h1>\n\n    <h2>List of Words</h2>\n    <ol>\n        <li>Stanford</li>\n        <li>University</li>\n        <li>Neuroscience</li>\n        <li>Technology</li>\n        <li>Research</li>\n        <li>Education</li>\n        <li>Biomedical</li>\n        <li>Innovations</li>\n        <li>Lab</li>\n        <li>Academics</li>\n    </ol>\n\n    <h2>Acronym</h2>\n    <p>The acronym created from the initial letters of these words is: <span class=\"acronym\">SUNTRAIL</span></p>\n\n    <h2>Prominent Alumna</h2>\n    <p>Rearranging the letters forms the name of a notable alumna: <span class=\"alumna\">Laura Tsien</span></p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **List of Words**: We have a list of ten words, and the initial letters form the acronym \"SUNTRAIL\", which creatively represents a university, such as Stanford University.\n\n2. **Acronym**: The acronym is styled to stand out using bold text and color.\n\n3. **Prominent Alumna**: The letters of the acronym are rearranged to form \"Laura Tsien,\" a fictional name for illustrative purposes. You'd replace this with a real name if you have one in mind.\n\nThis HTML page serves as a simple demonstration of how you can present the information required by the exercise."
