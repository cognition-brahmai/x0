I am using Python 2.7."

        "content": "In Python 2.7, the methods `write()` and `writelines()` behave differently when it comes to handling sequences of strings.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's happening:\n\n1. **`writelines()`**: This method expects an iterable (like a list or tuple) containing strings, and it writes each string to the file consecutively. It does not automatically add newlines between the strings, so you have to include them in the strings themselves if needed.\n\n   ```python\n   lines = (line1 + nl, line2 + nl, line3 + nl)\n   textdoc.writelines(lines)\n   ```\n\n   In your original code:\n   ```python\n   lines = line1, nl, line2, nl, line3, nl\n   textdoc.writelines(lines)\n   ```\n   This works as expected because you are passing a tuple of strings to `writelines()`, and it's writing each element of the tuple in sequence.\n\n2. **`write()`**: This method expects a single string, and it writes that string to the file as-is. If you pass a tuple or a list to `write()`, it will raise an error because it can't concatenate the tuple elements into a single string.\n\n   In your code:\n   ```python\n   textdoc.write(lines)\n   ```\n   This raises an error because `lines` is a tuple, and `write()` is not designed to handle tuples directly.\n\nTo achieve your goal of writing multiple lines with `write()`, you need to concatenate the strings into a single string before calling `write()`. You can do this by using the `join()` method along with list comprehension or by manually concatenating the strings as you did in your second example:\n\n```python\ntextdoc.write(line1 + \"\\n\" + line2 + \"\\n\" + line3 + \"\\n\")\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use `join()` for a cleaner approach:\n\n```python\nlines = \"\\n\".join([line1, line2, line3]) + \"\\n\"\ntextdoc.write(lines)\n```\n\nThis method is efficient and clean, and it ensures that each line ends with a newline character."
