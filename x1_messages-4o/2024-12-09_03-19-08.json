        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the `mysql_config` command not being found. This command is part of the MySQL development tools and is necessary for compiling the `MySQLdb` Python library. To resolve this issue, you'll need to install the MySQL development package on your Linux server. Here's how you can do that:\n\n1. **Install MySQL Development Tools**:\n   Depending on your Linux distribution, you can install the MySQL development package using your package manager. Here are the commands for some common distributions:\n\n   - **Ubuntu/Debian**:\n     ```bash\n     sudo apt-get update\n     sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev\n     ```\n\n   - **CentOS/RHEL**:\n     ```bash\n     sudo yum install mysql-devel\n     ```\n\n   - **Fedora**:\n     ```bash\n     sudo dnf install community-mysql-devel\n     ```\n\n2. **Verify Installation**:\n   After installation, verify that `mysql_config` is available by running:\n   ```bash\n   mysql_config --version\n   ```\n   If it returns a version number, then it's correctly installed.\n\n3. **Install MySQLdb**:\n   Once the MySQL development tools are installed, you can proceed to install `MySQLdb` using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install MySQL-python\n   ```\n\n   Alternatively, if you're using Python 3, the `MySQLdb` module is not available directly, so you might want to use `mysqlclient`, which is a fork of `MySQLdb` that works with Python 3:\n   ```bash\n   pip install mysqlclient\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify Installation**:\n   After installation, you can verify it by importing the module in a Python shell:\n   ```python\n   import MySQLdb\n   ```\n\nIf you encounter any further issues, make sure that your system's PATH environment variable includes the location of `mysql_config`, or specify the path directly in the setup script if needed. This should resolve the issue and allow you to successfully install the `MySQLdb` module."
