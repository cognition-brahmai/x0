However, when I try to save the image using plt.savefig(), it crops some important details from the right-hand side of the image. This is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nimport glob\nimport os\nfor file in glob.glob(\"*.oax\"):\n    try:\n        spc_file = open(file, 'r').read()\n        newName = file[6:8] + '-' + file[4:6] + '-' + file[0:4] + ' ' + file[8:12] +  ' UTC (Observed) - No Sea Breeze Day'\n        plt.title(newName, fontsize=12, loc='left')\n        plt.savefig('X:/' + newName + '.png')        \n        plt.show()\n    except Exception:\n        pass\n```\nI found solutions on how to fix this problem for plt.show() but none for plt.savefig(). How can I fix this issue for plt.savefig()?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing with `plt.savefig()` is likely due to the default bounding box settings which can crop parts of your plot, especially if there are elements like titles or labels extending beyond the plot area. Here's how you can address this problem:\n\n1. **Adjust the figure size:** Make sure the figure size is set appropriately to accommodate all elements. You can do this by setting the `figsize` parameter when creating the figure.\n\n2. **Use bbox_inches='tight':** When saving the figure, use the `bbox_inches='tight'` option. This ensures that all elements are included within the saved image.\n\n3. **Add padding:** You can add padding around the saved plot using the `pad_inches` parameter.\n\nHere is how you can modify your code to incorporate these steps:\n\n```python\nimport glob\nimport os\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nfor file in glob.glob(\"*.oax\"):\n    try:\n        spc_file = open(file, 'r').read()\n        newName = file[6:8] + '-' + file[4:6] + '-' + file[0:4] + ' ' + file[8:12] +  ' UTC (Observed) - No Sea Breeze Day'\n        \n        # Adjust figure size\n        plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\n        plt.title(newName, fontsize=12, loc='left')\n\n        # Save the plot with bbox_inches='tight' and add padding if necessary\n        plt.savefig('X:/' + newName + '.png', bbox_inches='tight', pad_inches=0.1)\n        \n        plt.show()\n        plt.close()  # Close the figure to free up memory\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- **plt.close():** It's a good practice to use `plt.close()` after saving and showing the plot to prevent memory issues if you're dealing with multiple plots in a loop.\n- **Check for errors:** Print any exceptions to understand if there's an error occurring during the execution of your code.\n\nThis approach should help you save your plots without cropping important details."
