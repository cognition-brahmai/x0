I have a 2D tensor (matrix) like this:\n\n```python\nx11 x12 .. x1N\n...\nxM1 xM2 .. xMN\n```\nand a vertical vector like this:\n\n```python\nw1\n...\nwN\n```\nI need to obtain a new matrix like this:\n\n```python\nx11*w1 x12*w2 ... x1N*wN\n...\nxM1*w1 xM2*w2 ... xMN*wN\n```\nThe context is that I have `M` data samples in a batch that can be processed in parallel, and each `N`-element sample must be multiplied by weights `w` stored in a variable to eventually pick the largest `Xij*wj` for each row `i`."

        "content": "To perform element-wise multiplication of a 2D tensor (matrix) and a vertical vector efficiently in TensorFlow, you can use broadcasting. Broadcasting allows you to perform operations on tensors of different shapes without explicitly replicating data. In your case, you want to multiply each column of the matrix by the corresponding element of the vector.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Ensure your matrix and vector are represented as TensorFlow tensors.\n2. Use broadcasting to multiply the matrix by the vector.\n\nHere's a sample code demonstrating this:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Example matrix (M x N)\nmatrix = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0],\n                      [4.0, 5.0, 6.0],\n                      [7.0, 8.0, 9.0]], dtype=tf.float32)\n\n# Vertical vector (N x 1)\nvector = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=tf.float32)\n\n# Reshape the vector to allow broadcasting\nvector_reshaped = tf.reshape(vector, (1, -1))\n\n# Perform element-wise multiplication using broadcasting\nresult = matrix * vector_reshaped\n\n# Find the maximum value in each row\nmax_values = tf.reduce_max(result, axis=1)\n\n# Run in a session if using TensorFlow 1.x or eager execution in TensorFlow 2.x\nprint(\"Element-wise multiplied matrix:\\n\", result.numpy())\nprint(\"Maximum value in each row:\", max_values.numpy())\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- The `matrix` is a 3x3 tensor, and the `vector` is a 3-element vector.\n- The `vector` is reshaped to `(1, N)` to enable broadcasting across the matrix columns.\n- Element-wise multiplication is performed using `matrix * vector_reshaped`.\n- `tf.reduce_max` is used to find the maximum value in each row.\n\nThis approach ensures that the multiplication is done efficiently without manually looping over the matrix or vector."
