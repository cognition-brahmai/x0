        "content": "The issue you're encountering is typically related to using different Python environments or paths. Here are some steps to help you troubleshoot and resolve the problem:\n\n1. **Check Python Versions**: Ensure that the Python version you are using to run your script or Python terminal is the same one where `httplib2` is installed. You can check the Python version with:\n\n    ```bash\n    $ python --version\n    ```\n\n   Compare this with the Python version where `httplib2` is installed:\n\n    ```bash\n    $ /usr/local/bin/python --version\n    ```\n\n2. **Check Python Path**: The `sys.path` variable in Python determines where Python looks for modules. Run the following in your Python terminal to check if the path where `httplib2` is installed is included:\n\n    ```python\n    import sys\n    print(sys.path)\n    ```\n\n   Ensure that `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages` is listed in the output.\n\n3. **Use Virtual Environment**: If you are not using virtual environments, consider creating one to manage your dependencies more effectively. Here's how you can set it up:\n\n    ```bash\n    $ python -m venv myenv\n    $ source myenv/bin/activate\n    $ pip install httplib2\n    ```\n\n   Then try importing `httplib2` within this virtual environment.\n\n4. **Check for Multiple Python Installations**: You might have multiple Python installations, and `pip` might be installing packages in a different Python environment. Use the following commands to ensure `pip` and `python` are aligned:\n\n    ```bash\n    $ which pip\n    $ which python\n    ```\n\n   Ensure they point to the same directory structure, e.g., both pointing to `/usr/local/bin`.\n\n5. **Reinstall httplib2**: As a last resort, try uninstalling and reinstalling `httplib2`:\n\n    ```bash\n    $ pip uninstall httplib2\n    $ pip install httplib2\n    ```\n\n6. **Check for Aliases**: Sometimes shell aliases can cause confusion. Check if `python` or `pip` is aliased to a different command by running:\n\n    ```bash\n    $ alias\n    ```\n\n   Look for any entries related to `python` or `pip`.\n\nFollowing these steps should help you identify and fix the issue with the `ImportError`. If the problem persists, consider checking any custom configurations or scripts that might be altering the Python environment."
