        "content": "To find the smallest possible side length for the squares that allows us to use the fewest number of squares, we need to determine the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the rectangle's dimensions, 12 and 18.\n\nThe GCD of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. Here's how to find it:\n\n1. **List the factors** of each number:\n   - Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\n   - Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18\n\n2. **Identify the common factors:** 1, 2, 3, 6\n\n3. **Determine the greatest of these common factors:** 6\n\nThus, the GCD of 12 and 18 is 6. \n\nTherefore, the smallest possible side length for the squares, which allows us to use the fewest number of squares, is 6 units. \n\nUsing this side length, the rectangle can be divided into:\n- \\( \\frac{12}{6} = 2 \\) squares along the 12-unit side\n- \\( \\frac{18}{6} = 3 \\) squares along the 18-unit side\n\nThis results in a total of \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\) squares."
