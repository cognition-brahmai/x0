I'm currently using the following code:\n\n```python\nimport datetime\nstart_date = datetime.date.today() + datetime.timedelta(-30)\n```\n\nHowever, it only returns a datetime object with date data but without time data. For instance, when I check the 'year' attribute, it works fine, but when I check the 'hour' attribute, it throws an AttributeError like this:\n\n```python\nstart_date.year\n2009\nstart_date.hour\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nAttributeError: 'datetime.date' object has no attribute 'hour'\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is because `datetime.date.today()` returns a `date` object, which only includes the year, month, and day, but not the time information (hours, minutes, seconds).\n\nTo include both date and time in your calculation, you should use `datetime.datetime.now()` instead. This will give you a `datetime` object, which includes both the date and time components. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\n# Get the current date and time\ncurrent_datetime = datetime.datetime.now()\n\n# Subtract 30 days from the current date and time\npast_datetime = current_datetime - datetime.timedelta(days=30)\n\n# Now you can access both date and time attributes\nprint(past_datetime.year)\nprint(past_datetime.hour)\n```\n\nWith this code, `past_datetime` will be a `datetime` object that represents the date and time exactly 30 days in the past from the current moment. You can access both date and time attributes like `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`, and `second`."
