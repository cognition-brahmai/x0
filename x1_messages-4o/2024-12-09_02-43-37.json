I was able to do this with old Jupyter notebooks using the following code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib notebook\nx = [1,2,3]\ny = [4,5,6]\nplt.figure()\nplt.plot(x,y)\n```\n\nBut when I try to use the same in JupyterLab, it gives me an error saying \"JavaScript output is disabled in JupyterLab\". I have jupyter-matplotlib installed and I tried the magic command `%matplotlib ipympl` but it just returns \"FigureCanvasNbAgg()\". Inline plots work with `%matplotlib inline`, but they are not interactive. How can I solve this issue?"

        "content": "To create interactive plots in JupyterLab, you need to ensure that you have the necessary packages installed and configured properly. Since you're encountering issues with interactivity using `matplotlib`, let's go through the steps to get interactive plots working in JupyterLab using `ipympl`, which is the interactive backend for `matplotlib` in Jupyter environments.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Install `ipympl`**: Make sure you have the `ipympl` library installed. You can install it using pip or conda:\n   ```bash\n   pip install ipympl\n   ```\n   or\n   ```bash\n   conda install -c conda-forge ipympl\n   ```\n\n2. **Enable JupyterLab extensions**: For JupyterLab, you need to ensure that the Jupyter widgets extension is enabled. If not already set up, you can enable it with the following command:\n   ```bash\n   jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager\n   ```\n\n3. **Use the `ipympl` backend**: In your JupyterLab notebook, use the `%matplotlib ipympl` magic command to set the backend for interactive plots:\n   ```python\n   %matplotlib ipympl\n\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n   x = [1, 2, 3]\n   y = [4, 5, 6]\n   plt.figure()\n   plt.plot(x, y)\n   plt.show()\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for Compatibility**: Ensure that your JupyterLab version is compatible with the installed extensions. Sometimes, updating JupyterLab and its extensions can resolve compatibility issues.\n\n5. **Restart JupyterLab**: After installing or updating extensions, it\u2019s a good practice to restart JupyterLab to ensure that all changes take effect.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to get interactive plots working in JupyterLab. If you still encounter issues, make sure to clear any old outputs and restart the kernel to start fresh. Additionally, checking for any errors in the browser console might give further insights if problems persist."
