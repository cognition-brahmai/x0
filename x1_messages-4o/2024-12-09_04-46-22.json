Here's a simple function that calculates the overlap between two intervals:\n\n```python\ndef interval_overlap(interval1, interval2):\n    # Unpack the intervals\n    start1, end1 = interval1\n    start2, end2 = interval2\n    \n    # Calculate the overlap\n    overlap_start = max(start1, start2)\n    overlap_end = min(end1, end2)\n    \n    # Determine if there is an overlap\n    overlap = max(0, overlap_end - overlap_start)\n    \n    return overlap\n\n# Test examples\ninterval1 = [10, 15]\ninterval2 = [20, 38]\nprint(interval_overlap(interval1, interval2))  # Output: 0\n\ninterval3 = [10, 20]\ninterval4 = [15, 20]\nprint(interval_overlap(interval3, interval4))  # Output: 5\n```\n\nThis function calculates the starting and ending points of the overlap and then determines its length. If the calculated overlap length is negative, it sets it to zero, indicating no overlap."
