Specifically, the phrase must be alliterative and based on the first letter of each color (e.g., \"Ravishing Red, Bold Blue, Gorgeous Green, and Youthful Yellow\"), and it must be complex enough to ensure it's not easily forgotten. \nAdditionally, can you provide a more advanced Swift code that can generate such a phrase dynamically based on any given list of colors? \nHere is an example HTML page containing a list of colors that can be used as input:\n```\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Red</li>\n      <li>Blue</li>\n      <li>Green</li>\n      <li>Yellow</li>\n    </ul>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\nAnd here is an example Swift code that can generate an alliterative mnemonic phrase based on the first letter of each color:\n```swift\nlet colors = [\"Red\", \"Blue\", \"Green\", \"Yellow\"]\nvar phrase = \"\"\nfor color in colors {\n    phrase += \"\\(color.first!) is for \\(color)\\n\"\n}\nprint(phrase)\n```"

        "content": "To create a more advanced Swift program that generates a unique and memorable alliterative mnemonic phrase based on a list of colors, we can enhance the basic example by introducing an array of adjectives for each letter. The program will randomly select an adjective for each color that starts with the same letter, creating a more complex and memorable phrase.\n\nHere's a more advanced Swift code example that achieves this:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\n// Define a dictionary of adjectives by their starting letter\nlet adjectives: [Character: [String]] = [\n    \"R\": [\"Ravishing\", \"Radiant\", \"Resplendent\"],\n    \"B\": [\"Bold\", \"Brilliant\", \"Breathtaking\"],\n    \"G\": [\"Gorgeous\", \"Glorious\", \"Gracious\"],\n    \"Y\": [\"Youthful\", \"Yummy\", \"Yellowish\"],\n    // Add more letters and adjectives as needed\n]\n\n// Function to generate a mnemonic phrase\nfunc generateMnemonicPhrase(for colors: [String]) -> String {\n    var phrase = \"\"\n    for color in colors {\n        if let firstLetter = color.first,\n           let adjectivesForLetter = adjectives[firstLetter],\n           !adjectivesForLetter.isEmpty {\n            let adjective = adjectivesForLetter.randomElement() ?? \"\"\n            phrase += \"\\(adjective) \\(color), \"\n        }\n    }\n    return phrase.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines).trimmingCharacters(in: CharacterSet(charactersIn: \",\"))\n}\n\n// Example usage\nlet colors = [\"Red\", \"Blue\", \"Green\", \"Yellow\"]\nlet mnemonicPhrase = generateMnemonicPhrase(for: colors)\nprint(mnemonicPhrase)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Adjectives Dictionary**: We define a dictionary where each key is a character representing the first letter of a color, and the value is an array of adjectives starting with that letter.\n\n2. **Random Selection**: For each color, the program selects a random adjective from the corresponding list of adjectives, ensuring variety each time the code is run.\n\n3. **Phrase Construction**: The phrase is constructed by concatenating a randomly selected adjective with each color, followed by a comma. The trailing comma is trimmed before returning the final phrase.\n\n4. **Extensibility**: You can easily extend the dictionary with more letters and adjectives to accommodate a wider range of colors.\n\n### Example Output\n\nRunning the code with the provided colors might produce an output like: \"Ravishing Red, Bold Blue, Gorgeous Green, Youthful Yellow,\" but the adjectives may vary due to randomness."
