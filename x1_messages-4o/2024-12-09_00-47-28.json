However, in other libraries like Tensorflow, it is usually 0.9 or 0.99 by default. Is this a different convention being used in PyTorch or is there something that I am missing?"

        "content": "The difference you're observing in the default momentum values between PyTorch and TensorFlow for batch normalization does indeed stem from a different convention in how momentum is used and defined in these libraries.\n\nIn PyTorch, the momentum parameter in the `BatchNorm` layers affects the running estimates of the mean and variance. Specifically, PyTorch uses this parameter to update the running statistics with a formula like:\n\n\\[ \\text{running\\_stat} = (1 - \\text{momentum}) \\times \\text{current\\_stat} + \\text{momentum} \\times \\text{running\\_stat} \\]\n\nSo, with PyTorch's default momentum of 0.1, the running statistics are updated with 90% of the current statistics and 10% of the previous running statistics. Essentially, a smaller momentum value in PyTorch means that the running estimates adapt more quickly to new data.\n\nOn the other hand, in TensorFlow, the momentum parameter is often defined in a way that corresponds to how much of the running statistic to retain, rather than how much to update. Therefore, a momentum value of 0.9 or 0.99 in TensorFlow implies retaining 90% or 99% of the running statistic, respectively, which essentially means using 10% or 1% of the new statistics to update.\n\nSo, while the numerical values are different, they are just two sides of the same coin due to the different update rules. The core idea is the same: both approaches are balancing how much of the new batch's statistics are used versus how much of the existing running statistics are retained. It\u2019s important to understand this distinction when transitioning models between these frameworks to ensure consistent behavior."
