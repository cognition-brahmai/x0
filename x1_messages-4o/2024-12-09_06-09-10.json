        "content": "To achieve the desired result of concatenating two 3D NumPy arrays to form a 4D array, you can use the `numpy.stack` function instead of `concatenate`. The `stack` function allows you to add a new dimension along a specified axis. \n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.ones((3, 4, 5))\nb = np.ones((3, 4, 5))\n\n# Use np.stack to concatenate along a new axis\nc = np.stack((a, b), axis=-1)\n\nprint(c.shape)  # Output will be (3, 4, 5, 2)\n```\n\nIn this code, `stack` is used with `axis=-1`, which means that the new dimension is added as the last axis, resulting in a shape of `(3, 4, 5, 2)`. This way, `c[:,:,:,0]` will correspond to the array `a` and `c[:,:,:,1]` will correspond to the array `b`, similar to how `cat(4, a, b)` works in MATLAB."
