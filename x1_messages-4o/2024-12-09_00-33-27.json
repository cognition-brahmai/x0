This tool is required by Django to handle the creation of message files for internationalization. Here's how you can resolve this issue on OSX El Capitan:\n\n1. **Install Homebrew (if not already installed):**\n   Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that makes it easy to install and manage software. If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can install it by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Install GNU gettext:**\n   Once you have Homebrew installed, you can install GNU gettext by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew install gettext\n   ```\n\n3. **Link gettext to make the tools available:**\n   After installing gettext, you need to link it so that its tools are accessible from the command line:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew link gettext --force\n   ```\n\n   Note: If `brew link gettext --force` doesn't work or if you're concerned about potential conflicts, you can add the gettext binaries to your PATH instead by adding the following line to your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc` (depending on your shell):\n\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/gettext/bin:$PATH\"\n   ```\n\n   After adding this line, make sure to reload your shell configuration:\n\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bash_profile\n   # or\n   source ~/.zshrc\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify Installation:**\n   You can verify that `msguniq` is installed correctly by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   msguniq --version\n   ```\n\n   You should see the version of `msguniq` and verify that it's installed properly.\n\n5. **Run the makemessages command again:**\n   Now that you have the necessary gettext tools installed, you should be able to run the Django `makemessages` command without any issues:\n\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py makemessages -l fr\n   ```\n\nFollowing these steps should resolve the error and allow you to create language files for your Django app."
