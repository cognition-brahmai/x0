        "content": "To establish an SSH connection to a remote server, execute a command, and print the output using a simple Python script, you can utilize the built-in `subprocess` module along with the `ssh` command-line tool. This approach requires SSH to be set up on both local and remote machines but does not require any large external Python libraries.\n\nHere's a basic example of how you can do this:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\ndef execute_ssh_command(username, password, host, command):\n    try:\n        # Construct the SSH command\n        ssh_command = f'ssh {username}@{host} {command}'\n        \n        # Execute the command using subprocess\n        result = subprocess.run(\n            ['sshpass', '-p', password, 'ssh', f'{username}@{host}', command],\n            capture_output=True, text=True, check=True\n        )\n        \n        # Print the command output\n        print(\"Output:\\n\", result.stdout)\n        print(\"Error (if any):\\n\", result.stderr)\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:\n        print(f\"Error executing command: {e}\")\n\n# Usage\nusername = \"your_username\"\npassword = \"your_password\"\nhost = \"your_remote_host\"\ncommand = \"ls -l\"  # Example command\n\nexecute_ssh_command(username, password, host, command)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **sshpass**: This tool is used to provide the password non-interactively. It can be installed on most Unix-based systems using package managers like `apt` (for Debian-based systems) or `brew` (for macOS).\n\n2. **subprocess.run()**: This function is used to execute the command and capture the output. The `capture_output=True` parameter captures both stdout and stderr. The `text=True` parameter ensures that the output is returned as a string.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: The `try-except` block captures any errors during the command execution.\n\n### Note:\n- Make sure that `sshpass` is installed on your local machine. You can install it using:\n  - On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install sshpass`\n  - On macOS: `brew install hudochenkov/sshpass/sshpass`\n- This script assumes that SSH and `sshpass` are available on your local machine.\n\nThis method is simple and doesn't require installing large external libraries, but remember that using `sshpass` to handle passwords can be insecure. It's better to use SSH keys for authentication in production environments."
