Currently, I'm using two files for this: 'environment.yml' for conda and 'requirements.txt' for pip. The 'environment.yml' file has the following content:\n\n```yml\n# run: conda env create --file environment.yml\nname: test-env\ndependencies:\n- python>=3.5\n- anaconda\n```\n\nAfter activating the conda environment, I use 'requirements.txt' for pip with the following content:\n\n```txt\n# run: pip install -i requirements.txt\ndocx\ngooey\nhttp://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/bofhrmxk/opencv_python-3.1.0-cp35-none-win_amd64.whl\n```\n\nIs there a way that I can combine these two files into one file that can be used for conda?"

        "content": "Combining Conda and pip dependencies into a single file is a bit tricky since Conda and pip handle package installation differently. However, you can use the `environment.yml` file to specify both Conda and pip dependencies, including pre-compiled wheels from external sources. Here is how you can do it:\n\n1. **Update your `environment.yml` file**: You can add a `pip` section under the `dependencies` key to specify pip packages. The `pip` section can include packages from PyPI as well as direct links to wheel files.\n\nHere's an example of how you might structure your `environment.yml`:\n\n```yml\n# run: conda env create --file environment.yml\nname: test-env\ndependencies:\n  - python>=3.5\n  - anaconda\n  - pip  # Ensure that pip is installed in the Conda environment\n  - pip:\n    - docx\n    - gooey\n    - https://download.lfd.uci.edu/pythonlibs/bofhrmxk/opencv_python-3.1.0-cp35-none-win_amd64.whl\n```\n\n2. **Creating the environment**: With this setup, you can create your environment using the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda env create --file environment.yml\n   ```\n\n3. **Activating the environment**: Once the environment is created, you activate it as usual:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda activate test-env\n   ```\n\nThis `environment.yml` file will instruct Conda to first install the specified Conda packages and then use pip to install the specified pip packages, including any pre-compiled wheels from URLs. \n\nNote that using pip within a Conda environment can sometimes lead to conflicts or issues, as Conda and pip don't always resolve dependencies in the same way. It's always a good idea to test the environment setup in a controlled scenario before deploying it in a production environment."
