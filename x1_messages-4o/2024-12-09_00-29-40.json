        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is likely due to missing dependencies required for building and installing NumPy from source on an Alpine-based Docker container. Alpine Linux uses musl libc instead of glibc, which sometimes requires additional packages for compiling C extensions in Python.\n\nHere are some steps to help resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Upgrade Alpine**: Consider using a more recent version of Alpine. Alpine 3.1 is quite old, and newer versions have better support for Python and related packages.\n\n2. **Install Required Build Tools**: Ensure you have all the necessary build dependencies. You might be missing some libraries required for building NumPy.\n\n3. **Install Additional Libraries**: These libraries are often required for building NumPy:\n\n   ```dockerfile\n   FROM alpine:3.15  # or another recent version\n   RUN apk add --no-cache \\\n       python3 \\\n       py3-pip \\\n       py3-numpy \\\n       py3-setuptools \\\n       build-base \\\n       python3-dev \\\n       musl-dev \\\n       libffi-dev \\\n       openblas-dev\n   ```\n\n4. **Use Pre-Built Wheels**: Instead of building from source, you can try installing pre-built wheels. Wheels are Python's built package format, and they often contain pre-compiled binaries, which can save you from having to build from source:\n\n   ```dockerfile\n   RUN pip install --upgrade pip\n   RUN pip install numpy\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify Python Version**: Ensure you're using the correct Python version and its associated packages. The above example uses Python 3, which is generally recommended over Python 2 since Python 2 is no longer supported.\n\n6. **Use `pip` instead of `easy_install`**: `pip` is more modern and widely used than `easy_install`, so stick with `pip`.\n\n7. **Consider Alpine Edge**: If you encounter further issues, consider using the Alpine Edge repository, which has the latest packages:\n\n   ```dockerfile\n   RUN echo \"http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/main\" >> /etc/apk/repositories\n   RUN echo \"http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/community\" >> /etc/apk/repositories\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to build and install NumPy successfully in your Alpine-based Docker container."
