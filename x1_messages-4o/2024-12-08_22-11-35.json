        "content": "Certainly! Let's start by implementing the selection sort algorithm in Python and then provide the required analysis and comparison.\n\n### Python Code for Selection Sort\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        min_index = i\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:\n                min_index = j\n        \n        # Swap the found minimum element with the first element\n        arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]\n\n    return arr\n\n# Sample array\narray = [3, 1, 4, 7, 8, 2]\nsorted_array = selection_sort(array)\nprint(\"Sorted array:\", sorted_array)\n```\n\n### Sample Output\n\nWhen you run the above code with the given array `[3, 1, 4, 7, 8, 2]`, the output will be:\n\n```\nSorted array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8]\n```\n\n### Time Complexity Analysis\n\n- **Selection Sort Time Complexity:**\n  - The outer loop runs `n` times, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.\n  - The inner loop runs `n-i-1` times for each iteration of the outer loop.\n  - In the worst-case scenario, the total number of comparisons made is approximately `n*(n-1)/2`.\n  - The number of swaps performed in selection sort is `n-1` since it swaps the minimum element found with the first unsorted element.\n  \n  Therefore, the time complexity for selection sort is **O(n^2)**.\n\n- **Effect of Doubling Input Size:**\n  - If the input size doubles, the number of comparisons increases quadratically. Thus, for an array of size `2n`, the number of comparisons would be `(2n*(2n-1))/2`, which is four times the original for array size `n`.\n\n### Comparison with Insertion Sort\n\n- **Insertion Sort Time Complexity:**\n  - Best-case: O(n) (when the array is already sorted)\n  - Average-case: O(n^2)\n  - Worst-case: O(n^2)\n\n- **Selection Sort Time Complexity:**\n  - Best-case: O(n^2)\n  - Average-case: O(n^2)\n  - Worst-case: O(n^2)\n  \n- **Space Complexity:**\n  - Both selection sort and insertion sort have a space complexity of O(1) because they are in-place sorting algorithms.\n\n- **Comparison:**\n  - **Insertion Sort** can be faster than selection sort in practice when dealing with partially sorted arrays due to its O(n) best-case performance.\n  - **Selection Sort** performs a fixed number of swaps (n-1), which can be advantageous if swapping is more expensive than comparisons.\n  - For large arrays, both algorithms are inefficient compared to more advanced algorithms like quicksort or mergesort, which have average time complexities of O(n log n).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSelection sort is simple but inefficient for large datasets due to its O(n^2) time complexity. Insertion sort can be more efficient for nearly sorted data, but both are generally surpassed by more advanced algorithms for larger data sets."
