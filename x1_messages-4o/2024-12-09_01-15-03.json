        "content": "I am working on designing an API with SQLAlchemy (querying MySQL) and I am looking for a way to apply the page_size (LIMIT) and page_number (OFFSET) parameters to all my queries. However, I am facing an issue when trying to do this. I attempted to use the .limit() and .offset() methods after applying all filter conditions, but I received an exception: \"sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: Query.filter() being called on a Query which already has LIMIT or OFFSET applied. To modify the row-limited results of a Query, call from_self() first. Otherwise, call filter() before limit() or offset() are applied.\" Here is the code I tried:\n\n```python\ndef q(page=0, page_size=None):\n    q = session.query(...)\n    if page_size: q = q.limit(page_size)\n    if page: q = q.offset(page*page_size)\n    return q\n```\n\nIs there a clean way to achieve this in SQLAlchemy? Perhaps by building a factory of some sort to create a custom Query object or utilizing a mixin class?"

        "content": "To address the issue you're facing with applying pagination parameters (`LIMIT` and `OFFSET`) to your SQLAlchemy queries, you can create a utility function that encapsulates this logic. The error message you're encountering suggests you're trying to chain `filter()` after applying `limit()` or `offset()`, which is causing the issue. \n\nHere's a clean approach to handle this using a utility function that applies pagination parameters after all filtering and other query modifications are done:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import Query\n\ndef apply_pagination(query: Query, page: int = 0, page_size: int = None) -> Query:\n    \"\"\"\n    Apply pagination to a SQLAlchemy query.\n    \n    :param query: The initial SQLAlchemy query.\n    :param page: The current page number (0-indexed).\n    :param page_size: The number of items per page.\n    :return: The modified query with pagination applied.\n    \"\"\"\n    if page_size is not None:\n        query = query.limit(page_size)\n    if page is not None and page_size is not None:\n        query = query.offset(page * page_size)\n    return query\n\n# Usage of the utility function\ndef get_query_with_pagination(page=0, page_size=None, additional_filters=None):\n    q = session.query(...)\n\n    # Apply additional filters if any\n    if additional_filters:\n        q = q.filter(*additional_filters)\n\n    # Apply pagination\n    q = apply_pagination(q, page, page_size)\n    \n    return q\n\n# Example usage\nfilters = [YourModel.some_column == some_value]  # Add your filter conditions here\npaginated_query = get_query_with_pagination(page=1, page_size=10, additional_filters=filters)\nresults = paginated_query.all()  # Fetch the results\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Utility Function (`apply_pagination`)**: This function takes a SQLAlchemy query and pagination parameters, applying the `limit()` and `offset()` methods in a controlled manner.\n\n2. **Query Construction**: In `get_query_with_pagination`, start by constructing your base query and apply any additional filters before calling `apply_pagination`.\n\n3. **Pagination Logic**: The `apply_pagination` function checks if `page_size` is provided, then applies `limit()` and `offset()` accordingly, ensuring that the pagination logic is separated from the rest of the query construction process.\n\nThis approach helps maintain clean and reusable code, allowing you to easily apply pagination to any query by utilizing the utility function."
