The configurations could look like [(0, 1), (2, 3), (4, 5)], [(0, 1), (2, 4), (3, 5)], [(0, 1), (2, 5), (3, 4)] and so on. In this context, (a, b) is considered equal to (b, a) and the order of pairs is not important. So [(0, 1), (2, 3), (4, 5)] would be equal to [(0, 1), (4, 5), (2, 3)]. The total number of such configurations is 1*3*5*...*(N-1) where N is the length of my list. How can I write a generator in Python that gives me all possible configurations for an arbitrary N?"

        "content": "To generate all possible pairings of the list in Python, you can use a recursive approach that constructs the pairings one pair at a time. Here's a generator function that does just that:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef all_pairings(L):\n    if len(L) < 2:\n        yield []\n        return\n    \n    # Choose the first element\n    first = L[0]\n    \n    # Iterate over possible pairs with the first element\n    for i in range(1, len(L)):\n        # Create a pair\n        pair = (first, L[i])\n        \n        # Remaining elements\n        rest = L[1:i] + L[i+1:]\n        \n        # Recursively find pairings of the remaining elements\n        for rest_pairing in all_pairings(rest):\n            yield [pair] + rest_pairing\n\n# Example usage\nL = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nfor pairing in all_pairings(L):\n    print(pairing)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Base Case**: If the list `L` has fewer than 2 elements, yield an empty list, as no pairs can be formed.\n\n2. **Recursive Case**:\n   - Select the first element of the list.\n   - Iterate over the rest of the elements to form a pair with the first element.\n   - For each pair, form a new list of remaining elements.\n   - Recursively generate pairings for the remaining elements.\n   - Yield each complete pairing as a list of pairs.\n\nThis generator will yield each unique configuration of pairs for the list. The order of pairs within a configuration and the order within each pair are considered identical, as per your requirements. This solution should work efficiently for reasonably small lists, but be cautious with very large lists due to combinatorial explosion."
