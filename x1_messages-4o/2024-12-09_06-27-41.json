I have attempted this using the following code, where I open the file in append mode, seek to the first position, write the text, and then close the file.\n\n```python\nf=open('log.txt','a')\nf.seek(0) #get to the first position\nf.write(\"text\")\nf.close()\n```\nHowever, this starts writing from the end of the file given that the file is opened in append mode. I need a way to write to the start of the file instead."

        "content": "To prepend a line to the beginning of a file in Python, you need to open the file in read mode, read its contents, and then write the new content followed by the old content to the file. You can't directly prepend text to a file like appending, because files don't support inserting at arbitrary positions. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Open the file in read mode to read its current content\nwith open('log.txt', 'r') as file:\n    original_content = file.read()\n\n# Open the file in write mode to overwrite it with the new content\nwith open('log.txt', 'w') as file:\n    # Write the new content followed by the original content\n    file.write(\"text\\n\" + original_content)\n```\n\nThis code snippet reads the entire file content into memory, then writes the new line followed by the original content back to the file. Note that this approach is suitable for relatively small files, as it involves reading the entire file content into memory. For very large files, you might need a more memory-efficient approach."
