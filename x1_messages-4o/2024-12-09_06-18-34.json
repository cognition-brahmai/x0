        "content": "In Python, a string starting with `\\x` followed by two hexadecimal digits, such as `\\xaa`, represents a byte in hexadecimal notation. This is part of Python's string escape sequences, which are used to represent special characters that cannot be easily typed into a string.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the differences:\n\n1. **`\\xaa`**: This represents a single byte with a hexadecimal value of `AA`. In decimal, this is 170. When you see `\\x` in a string, it indicates that the following two characters are a hexadecimal number representing a byte. For example, in a byte string, `b'\\xaa'` would be a single byte with a value of 170.\n\n2. **`'aa'`**: This is a regular string containing two ASCII characters, 'a' and 'a'. Each 'a' is a separate character with an ASCII value of 97, so together they represent two separate bytes.\n\nThe `\\x` escape sequence is particularly useful when working with binary data, where you need to specify exact byte values.\n\nFor more information on string literals and escape sequences in Python, you can refer to the official Python documentation. The section on string and byte literals can be found here:\n\n- [String and Bytes literals](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals)\n\nThis section of the documentation explains the different types of string literals, including those that use escape sequences like `\\x`, and provides insight into how to work with both text and binary data in Python."
