I attempted to fix the issue by removing the 'pillow' library and re-installing it using 'conda install', but the error persists. The error message I receive is as follows:\n```python\nImportError: cannot import name 'PILLOW_VERSION' from 'PIL'\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering arises because the `PILLOW_VERSION` attribute has been removed in newer versions of the Pillow library. As of Pillow 7.0.0, `PILLOW_VERSION` is no longer available. Instead, you should use `__version__` to get the version of the Pillow library.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use the new attribute:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import __version__ as PILLOW_VERSION\n\nprint(PILLOW_VERSION)\n```\n\nIf you're maintaining code that relies on `PILLOW_VERSION` for compatibility reasons, you can update your code to check for the version using `__version__`.\n\nEnsure that you have the latest version of Pillow installed by running:\n\n```bash\nconda update pillow\n```\n\nAfter updating, modify your code to use `__version__` instead of `PILLOW_VERSION`. This should resolve the import error."
