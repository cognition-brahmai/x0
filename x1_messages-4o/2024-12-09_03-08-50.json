I have noticed that if I change the 'HOME' (in Linux) or 'USERPROFILE' (in Windows) environmental variables and then run a Python script, it returns the new value as the user home when I try the following commands:\n```python\nos.environ['HOME']\nos.exp\n```\nIs there a way to find the actual user home directory without relying on these environmental variables? I am aware that it's possible to find the user home in Windows by reading from the registry. Moreover, I know it's also possible to find the Windows home using pywin32, as follows:\n```python\nfrom win32com.shell import shell,shellcon\nhome = shell.SHGetFolderPath(0, shellcon.CSIDL_PROFILE, None, 0)\n```"

        "content": "To find the real user home directory in a way that doesn't rely solely on environment variables, you can use different methods based on the operating system you are working with. Here's how you can achieve this on both Linux and Windows:\n\n### Linux\nOn Linux, you can utilize the Python `pwd` module, which provides access to the Unix password database. Here's how you can get the real home directory:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport pwd\n\ndef get_real_home_linux():\n    return pwd.getpwuid(os.getuid()).pw_dir\n\nreal_home = get_real_home_linux()\nprint(\"Real Home Directory on Linux:\", real_home)\n```\n\n### Windows\nOn Windows, as you mentioned, you can use the `pywin32` library to access system APIs. However, if you want a solution without using `pywin32`, you can use the `os.path.expanduser` method, which is designed to return the user's home directory reliably:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef get_real_home_windows():\n    return os.path.expanduser(\"~\")\n\nreal_home = get_real_home_windows()\nprint(\"Real Home Directory on Windows:\", real_home)\n```\n\nThe `os.path.expanduser(\"~\")` method works across different operating systems and is generally a reliable way to get the user's home directory, as it considers the specific environment variables and system calls needed for each platform.\n\nThese methods should give you the real user home directory irrespective of changes in environment variables."
