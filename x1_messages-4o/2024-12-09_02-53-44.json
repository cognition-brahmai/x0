        "content": "I am working with nested functions and local variables in Python. I have a class named 'Cage' and a couple of functions 'gotimes' and 'get_petters'. In 'get_petters', I have a nested function 'pet_function' that prints a statement involving a 'cage' object. However, when I run the code, it prints: \"Mary pets the cat\" for all three animals 'cow', 'dog', and 'cat'. Why am I not getting three different animals? Isn't the 'cage' packaged into the local scope of the nested function? How does a call to the nested function look up the local variables? \n\n```python\nfrom functools import partial\n\nclass Cage(object):\n    def __init__(self, animal):\n        self.animal = animal\n\ndef gotimes(do_the_petting):\n    do_the_petting()\n\ndef get_petters():\n    for animal in ['cow', 'dog', 'cat']:\n        cage = Cage(animal)\n\n        def pet_function():\n            print \"Mary pets the \" + cage.animal + \".\"\n\n        yield (animal, partial(gotimes, pet_function))\n\nfuns = list(get_petters())\n\nfor name, f in funs:\n    print name + \":\", \n    f()\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```python\ncow: Mary pets the cat.\ndog: Mary pets the cat.\ncat: Mary pets the cat.\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the way closures work in Python. When you create a closure with a nested function, the inner function captures the variables from the enclosing scope, not their values at the time the closure is created. This means that all instances of `pet_function` are capturing the same `cage` variable, which ends up being the last `Cage` object created in the loop, the one containing 'cat'.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can use default arguments for the nested function to bind the current value of `cage` at each iteration. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nfrom functools import partial\n\nclass Cage(object):\n    def __init__(self, animal):\n        self.animal = animal\n\ndef gotimes(do_the_petting):\n    do_the_petting()\n\ndef get_petters():\n    for animal in ['cow', 'dog', 'cat']:\n        cage = Cage(animal)\n\n        def pet_function(cage=cage):\n            print(\"Mary pets the \" + cage.animal + \".\")\n\n        yield (animal, partial(gotimes, pet_function))\n\nfuns = list(get_petters())\n\nfor name, f in funs:\n    print(name + \":\", end=\" \")\n    f()\n```\n\nBy using a default argument `cage=cage` in the `pet_function`, each closure will capture the `cage` object as it was at the time of the closure's creation, leading to the correct output:\n\n```plaintext\ncow: Mary pets the cow.\ndog: Mary pets the dog.\ncat: Mary pets the cat.\n```\n\nThis technique effectively binds the current value of `cage` to `pet_function` at each iteration, ensuring that each function uses the correct `Cage` object."
