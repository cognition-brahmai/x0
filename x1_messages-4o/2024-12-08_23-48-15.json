Here is a sample code to achieve that:\n\n```python\nimport statistics\n\n# List of words\nwords = [\"Banana\", \"Pineapple\", \"Orange\", \"Watermelon\", \"Strawberry\"]\n\n# Calculate the length of each word\nlengths = [len(word) for word in words]\n\n# Calculate the standard deviation of the lengths\nstandard_deviation = statistics.stdev(lengths)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"Standard Deviation of the lengths:\", standard_deviation)\n```\n\nThis code first calculates the length of each word using the `len()` function, then calculates the standard deviation of these lengths using the `statistics.stdev()` function, and finally prints the result."
