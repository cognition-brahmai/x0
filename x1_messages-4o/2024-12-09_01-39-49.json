However, when I try to return the list from the first function to use in the second, it doesn't work as expected. What does \"return\" actually do and how can I use it to pass the list from one function to another without utilizing global variables? Here is my current code and its output:\n\n```python\nlist = []\n\ndef defineAList():\n    list = ['1','2','3']\n    print \"For checking purposes: in defineAList, list is\",list\n    return list\n\ndef useTheList(list):\n    print \"For checking purposes: in useTheList, list is\",list\n\ndef main():\n    defineAList()\n    useTheList(list)\n\nmain()\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```python\nFor checking purposes: in defineAList, list is ['1', '2', '3']\nFor checking purposes: in useTheList, list is []\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is due to the way you're handling variable scopes and the way you are using the `return` statement. In Python, variables defined inside a function are local to that function unless otherwise specified. In your code, the `list` defined inside `defineAList()` is local to that function and is not affecting the global `list`.\n\nLet me explain what `return` does: it is used to send back a value from a function to the caller. When you call a function that uses `return`, you should capture the returned value in a variable to use it later.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to pass the list between functions properly without using global variables:\n\n```python\ndef defineAList():\n    my_list = ['1', '2', '3']\n    print(\"For checking purposes: in defineAList, list is\", my_list)\n    return my_list\n\ndef useTheList(my_list):\n    print(\"For checking purposes: in useTheList, list is\", my_list)\n\ndef main():\n    my_list = defineAList()  # Capture the returned list\n    useTheList(my_list)  # Pass the captured list to the next function\n\nmain()\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nFor checking purposes: in defineAList, list is ['1', '2', '3']\nFor checking purposes: in useTheList, list is ['1', '2', '3']\n```\n\nIn this version, `defineAList()` returns the list, which is then captured in the `my_list` variable inside `main()`. This `my_list` is then passed as an argument to `useTheList()`, ensuring that the same list is used across both functions. By doing so, you avoid using global variables and make your functions more modular and easier to test."
