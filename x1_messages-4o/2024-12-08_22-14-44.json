You need to prepare a shopping list for food items that meet everyone's dietary needs, including appetizers, main course, dessert, and drinks. In addition, you want to impress your guests by incorporating exotic ingredients such as truffles, caviar, and saffron. To make the shopping list more challenging, you want to include the estimated cost of each item, and you prefer to purchase the ingredients from three different stores to get the best deals. Finally, you want to write the shopping list in a format that is compatible with your grocery delivery app, which requires you to use a specific syntax and include the quantity and unit of measurement for each item."
