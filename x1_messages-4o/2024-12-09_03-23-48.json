Here is the code I've been trying:\n\n```python\ncommand = \"ffmpeg -i \"concat:1.ts|2.ts\" -vcodec copy -acodec copy temp.mp4\"\n\noutput,error = subprocess.Popen(command, universal_newlines=True,\nstdout=subprocess.PIPE,\nstderr=subprocess.PIPE).communicate()\n```\nWhen I run this, ffmpeg won't accept it unless there are quotes around the concat segment. Is there a way to successfully pass this command to subprocess.Popen?"

        "content": "To pass a command with arguments that require literal double quotes through `subprocess.Popen()` in Python, you should provide the command as a list of strings. This way, `subprocess` will handle the quoting for you. Here is how you can format the command correctly:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\ncommand = [\n    \"ffmpeg\",\n    \"-i\",\n    'concat:1.ts|2.ts',\n    \"-vcodec\",\n    \"copy\",\n    \"-acodec\",\n    \"copy\",\n    \"temp.mp4\"\n]\n\noutput, error = subprocess.Popen(\n    command,\n    universal_newlines=True,\n    stdout=subprocess.PIPE,\n    stderr=subprocess.PIPE\n).communicate()\n\nprint(\"Output:\", output)\nprint(\"Error:\", error)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- By passing the command as a list, each element is treated as a separate argument. This helps avoid issues with spaces and special characters.\n- The list elements are separated properly, so you don't need to worry about quoting arguments manually.\n- Ensure that the `concat` argument (`'concat:1.ts|2.ts'`) is a single element in the list. The single quotes in the list are for Python strings and are not passed to the command line.\n\nThis approach is more reliable and helps avoid common issues with handling special characters and spaces in shell commands."
