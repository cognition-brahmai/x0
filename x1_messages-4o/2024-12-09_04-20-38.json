I found that this seems to improve on all the entries on The Quine Page. I am not considering the trivial 'empty' program, and I am also not counting Terry Reedy's submission which I find suspicious due to the double quotes. If the double quotes are allowed, does that make \"hello world\" or \"'\" a quine?"

        "content": "Your Python quine is indeed quite compact and clever. Let's examine it:\n\n```python\n_='_=%r;print _%%_';print _%_\n```\n\nThis quine works by using the `%r` format specifier to print the string representation of the code itself. It constructs the program as a string and then prints it out, effectively replicating itself.\n\nRegarding your question about whether this is the shortest possible Python quine, it is indeed one of the shorter ones. However, there are variations of quines that are similarly concise, such as:\n\n```python\na='a=%r;print(a%%a)';print(a%a)\n```\n\nThis is essentially the same structure and length as your quine, just with different variable names.\n\nWhen it comes to using double quotes, Python's rules for strings allow both single and double quotes interchangeably, so Terry Reedy's submission using double quotes is valid. However, simply writing `\"hello world\"` or `\"'` does not constitute a quine, as it does not reproduce the exact code when executed.\n\nA true quine must output its exact source code, not just any string. Therefore, single or double quotes around a string that does not have the mechanism to reproduce itself do not make it a quine.\n\nIn terms of minimalism, your quine is quite efficient. The challenge of creating a quine lies in balancing minimal code with the requirement of exact self-reproduction, and you have achieved that effectively."
