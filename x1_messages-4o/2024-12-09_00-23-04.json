I'm unsure why this is happening. For instance, when I run the following code:\n```python\ndef smaller(x, y):\n    if x > y:\n        print(y) \n    else:\n        print(x) \n\nprint(smaller(2, 3))\n```\nI get the following output:\n```python\n2\nNone\n```\nCould you explain where this 'None' is coming from and what it means?"

        "content": "The \"None\" you are seeing in the output is coming from the `print(smaller(2, 3))` line. Here's why:\n\n1. **Function Return Value:** In Python, if a function does not explicitly return a value using a `return` statement, it implicitly returns `None` by default. This is the case with your `smaller` function; it prints the smaller number but does not have a return statement.\n\n2. **Printing the Function Call:** When you call `print(smaller(2, 3))`, you're actually printing the return value of the `smaller` function. Since `smaller` returns `None`, `print(smaller(2, 3))` prints `None`.\n\nTo avoid printing `None`, you can modify your code so that you only call `print` within the function itself, and not on the result of the function call. Here's an approach:\n\n```python\ndef smaller(x, y):\n    if x > y:\n        print(y)\n    else:\n        print(x)\n\nsmaller(2, 3)  # Just call the function without printing its result\n```\n\nThis way, the function will print the smaller number, and there will be no attempt to print the function's return value (which is `None`)."
