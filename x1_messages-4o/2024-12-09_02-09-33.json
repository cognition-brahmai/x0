Please restart current shell and try again.\" I'm following a tutorial at this link: https://tutorials.technology/tutorials/59-Start-a-flask-project-from-zero-building-api-rest.html. My Python version is 3.6.0 and my virtualenv version is 15.1.0. I've tried creating a .bash_profile with the following commands: \n\n```\neval \"$(pyenv init -)\"\neval \"$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)\"\nexec \"$SHELL\"\nif which pyenv-virtualenv-init > /dev/null; then eval \"$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)\"; fi\n```\n\nHowever, I'm still unable to start the virtual environment properly. What should I do to resolve this issue?"

        "content": "To resolve the issue with activating your virtual environment using `pyenv` and `pyenv-virtualenv`, follow these steps to ensure everything is set up correctly:\n\n1. **Check Installation**: Ensure that both `pyenv` and `pyenv-virtualenv` are installed correctly. You can verify this by running:\n   ```bash\n   pyenv --version\n   pyenv virtualenvs\n   ```\n\n2. **Update Shell Configuration**: Make sure your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, depending on your shell) is properly set up:\n\n   - Open your shell configuration file in an editor. For example:\n     ```bash\n     nano ~/.bashrc\n     ```\n\n   - Ensure that you have the following lines in your configuration file:\n     ```bash\n     export PATH=\"$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH\"\n     eval \"$(pyenv init --path)\"\n     eval \"$(pyenv init -)\"\n     eval \"$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)\"\n     ```\n\n   - Save the changes and restart your shell or source the configuration file:\n     ```bash\n     source ~/.bashrc\n     ```\n\n3. **Restart Your Shell**: Close your terminal and open a new one, or restart your shell session to apply the changes.\n\n4. **Recreate the Virtual Environment**: If the problem persists, try recreating the virtual environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   pyenv uninstall new_app\n   pyenv virtualenv 3.6.0 new_app\n   ```\n\n5. **Activate the Virtual Environment**: Attempt to activate the virtual environment again:\n\n   ```bash\n   pyenv activate new_app\n   ```\n\n6. **Check for Conflicts**: Ensure there are no conflicts with other Python environment managers like `virtualenvwrapper` or `conda`, as they may interfere with `pyenv`.\n\n7. **Additional Debugging**: If you're still encountering issues, you can check your shell's error logs or run the following command to debug:\n   ```bash\n   set -x\n   pyenv activate new_app\n   set +x\n   ```\n   This will give you more detailed output on what might be failing during the activation process.\n\nFollowing these steps should help you resolve the issue with activating your virtual environment using `pyenv`. If you encounter any specific error messages during these steps, feel free to provide them for further assistance."
