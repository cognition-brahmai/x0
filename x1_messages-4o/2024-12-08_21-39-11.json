The detective solved the mystery. \n2. The mystery was solved by the detective. \nTo solve the puzzle, you need to identify the grammatical rule used to determine the voice of the sentence. Once you have identified the rule, you can determine which sentence is in the passive voice and which is in the active voice. \nGood luck!"

        "content": "Certainly! To determine whether a sentence is in the active or passive voice, you need to look at the structure of the sentence and identify who is performing the action and who is receiving it.\n\n1. **Active Voice**: In the active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the action. The structure typically follows the pattern: Subject + Verb + Object.\n\n2. **Passive Voice**: In the passive voice, the subject of the sentence receives the action. The structure typically follows the pattern: Object + \"to be\" verb + Past Participle + (optional: \"by\" + Agent).\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the provided sentences:\n\n1. **The detective solved the mystery.**\n   - Here, \"The detective\" is the subject performing the action of solving, and \"the mystery\" is the object receiving the action.\n   - This sentence follows the Subject + Verb + Object pattern, which means it is in the **active voice**.\n\n2. **The mystery was solved by the detective.**\n   - In this sentence, \"The mystery\" is the subject, but it is not performing the action. Instead, it is receiving the action of being solved.\n   - The phrase \"was solved by the detective\" indicates that the action is being performed on the subject by the detective.\n   - This sentence follows the Object + \"to be\" verb + Past Participle + \"by\" + Agent pattern, which means it is in the **passive voice**.\n\nTherefore, sentence 1 is in the active voice, and sentence 2 is in the passive voice."
