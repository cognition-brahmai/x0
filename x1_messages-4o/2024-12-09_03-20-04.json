The call uses multiple arguments such as the URL, a payload, some auth stuff, etc. I want to verify that `requests.post` is called with a particular URL, but I am not concerned about the other arguments. When I use `requests.post.assert_called_with(requests_arguments)`, the test fails as it expects the method to be called with only that argument. Is there a way to check if a single argument is used somewhere in the function call without having to pass in the other arguments? Or, can I assert a specific URL and then abstract data types for the other arguments (i.e., data should be a dictionary, auth should be an instance of HTTPBasicAuth, etc.)?"

        "content": "To assert that a method was called with a specific argument while using the `Mock` library, you can utilize the `unittest.mock` library's `assert_any_call` or `assert_called_with` methods along with `unittest.mock.ANY` for arguments you are not concerned with. This allows you to focus on the specific argument you want to verify, while ignoring others.\n\nHere's a way to do it:\n\n1. **Using `assert_any_call` with `ANY`:** This method checks if the mock was called with the specific arguments at least once.\n\n```python\nfrom unittest.mock import patch, ANY\n\n@patch('requests.post')\ndef test_post_request(mock_post):\n    # Your code that calls requests.post\n    mock_post('http://example.com', data={'key': 'value'}, auth=('user', 'pass'))\n\n    # Assert that requests.post was called with the specific URL\n    mock_post.assert_any_call('http://example.com', ANY, ANY)\n```\n\nIn this example, `ANY` is used as a placeholder for arguments you do not want to specify. It tells the mock that those arguments can be anything.\n\n2. **Using `assert_called_with` and argument matchers:**\n\nIf you want to be more precise about the types of other arguments, you can use custom matchers or the built-in ones.\n\n```python\nfrom unittest.mock import patch, ANY, call\nfrom requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth\n\n@patch('requests.post')\ndef test_post_request(mock_post):\n    # Your code that calls requests.post\n    mock_post('http://example.com', data={'key': 'value'}, auth=HTTPBasicAuth('user', 'pass'))\n\n    # Assert that requests.post was called with the specific URL and other argument types\n    mock_post.assert_called_with(\n        'http://example.com',\n        data=ANY,  # Use ANY to allow any dictionary\n        auth=ANY   # Use ANY to allow any auth object\n    )\n```\n\nIn this example, `ANY` is used for arguments where you don't care about the specific value, but you can replace `ANY` with more specific matchers if needed.\n\nThese methods allow you to verify that your function calls the `requests.post` method with the expected arguments, while keeping tests flexible and focused only on the aspects of the call you care about."
