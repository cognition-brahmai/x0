        "content": "The code snippet you provided is a good start for analyzing text files to determine word frequency using Java. It reads a text file, splits each line into words using a regular expression, and counts the occurrences of each word. Below, I'll enhance the code slightly and add a few comments to help clarify its function:\n\n```java\nimport java.io.File;\nimport java.io.FileNotFoundException;\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.Map;\nimport java.util.Scanner;\nimport java.util.stream.Collectors;\nimport java.util.LinkedHashMap;\n\npublic class WordFrequencyCounter {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Map<String, Integer> wordFrequency = new HashMap<>();\n\n        try {\n            // Load the Shakespeare's text file\n            File file = new File(\"shakespeare.txt\");\n            Scanner scanner = new Scanner(file);\n\n            // Read each line from the file\n            while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {\n                String line = scanner.nextLine().toLowerCase(); // Convert to lowercase for uniformity\n                String[] words = line.split(\"\\\\W+\"); // Split by non-word characters\n\n                // Count the frequency of each word\n                for (String word : words) {\n                    if (!word.isEmpty()) { // Ignore empty strings\n                        wordFrequency.put(word, wordFrequency.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            scanner.close();\n        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n            System.out.println(\"File not found.\");\n        }\n\n        // Sort the words by frequency in descending order\n        Map<String, Integer> sortedWordFrequency = wordFrequency.entrySet()\n            .stream()\n            .sorted((entry1, entry2) -> entry2.getValue().compareTo(entry1.getValue()))\n            .collect(Collectors.toMap(\n                Map.Entry::getKey, \n                Map.Entry::getValue, \n                (e1, e2) -> e1, \n                LinkedHashMap::new\n            ));\n\n        // Print the most frequently used words\n        sortedWordFrequency.forEach((word, frequency) -> \n            System.out.println(word + \": \" + frequency)\n        );\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Lowercase Conversion**: I added `toLowerCase()` to ensure the word counting is case-insensitive.\n2. **Non-word Characters**: The regex `\\\\W+` splits lines into words by removing punctuation and spaces.\n3. **Empty Strings**: Added a check to ignore empty strings that may result from splitting.\n4. **Sorting**: The map is sorted by frequency in descending order using Java Streams, allowing you to easily identify the most frequently used words.\n\n### Considerations:\n- **Stop Words**: You might want to exclude common stop words (like \"the\", \"and\", \"of\") from the analysis to focus on more meaningful words.\n- **Performance**: For very large text files, consider optimizing the code for performance and memory usage (e.g., using more efficient data structures or parallel processing).\n\nThis code provides a basic framework for text analysis and can be further adapted to include additional features like phrase frequency analysis or more sophisticated text processing."
