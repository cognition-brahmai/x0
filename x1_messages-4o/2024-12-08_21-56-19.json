        "content": "A reciprocal function is a type of mathematical function that is defined as the inverse of another function. In its simplest form, the reciprocal function is given by \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\), where \\( x \\neq 0 \\). This means that for any non-zero number \\( x \\), the reciprocal of \\( x \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{x} \\).\n\nKey characteristics of the reciprocal function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\) include:\n\n1. **Domain and Range**: The domain of the reciprocal function includes all real numbers except zero, as division by zero is undefined. Similarly, its range is also all real numbers except zero.\n\n2. **Asymptotes**: The graph of the reciprocal function has two asymptotes. There is a vertical asymptote at \\( x = 0 \\) and a horizontal asymptote at \\( y = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Graph Shape**: The graph of \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\) is a hyperbola with two branches. One branch is in the first quadrant (where both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are positive), and the other is in the third quadrant (where both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are negative).\n\n4. **Symmetry**: The reciprocal function is symmetric with respect to the origin, meaning it is an odd function. This implies that \\( f(-x) = -f(x) \\).\n\n5. **Behavior**: As \\( x \\) approaches zero from either the positive or negative side, \\( f(x) \\) increases or decreases without bound, reflecting the vertical asymptote. As \\( x \\) becomes very large or very small, \\( f(x) \\) approaches zero, reflecting the horizontal asymptote.\n\nReciprocal functions can also take forms like \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{g(x)} \\) where \\( g(x) \\) is another function, and the properties of the reciprocal function will depend on \\( g(x) \\)."
