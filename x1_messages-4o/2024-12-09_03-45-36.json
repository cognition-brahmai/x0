However, I am encountering an error message that reads \"System Message: ERROR/3 (<stdin>, line 9) Unknown directive type \"toctree\". This happens even though I have included the autodoc extension in my conf.py file. The error message details are as follows:\n\n```\nSystem Message: ERROR/3 (<stdin>, line 9)\n\nUnknown directive type \"toctree\".\n\n..toctree::\n :maxdepth: 2\n\nfile1\nfile2\n```\n\nStrangely, when I open the /build/index.html file, everything works fine. How can I fix this issue so that I can eliminate this error from the PyCharm preview mode and preview my document without having to open the /build/index.html file all the time?"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering suggests that the Sphinx directives are not being recognized in the PyCharm preview mode, while the build process itself is working fine when generating the HTML. This discrepancy can be due to several reasons:\n\n1. **Ensure Sphinx is Properly Installed:**\n   - Make sure that Sphinx is correctly installed in the environment that PyCharm is using. You might want to verify this by running `pip show sphinx` or `pip list` in the terminal within PyCharm to check the Sphinx version.\n\n2. **Check PyCharm Settings:**\n   - PyCharm might not be configured to use the correct Python interpreter or environment where Sphinx is installed. Go to `File > Settings > Project: [Your Project Name] > Python Interpreter` and ensure the interpreter is set to the one where Sphinx is installed.\n\n3. **Sphinx Extensions:**\n   - Double-check your `conf.py` file to ensure that the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` and any other necessary extensions are included in the `extensions` list.\n   - Example:\n     ```python\n     extensions = [\n         'sphinx.ext.autodoc',\n         'sphinx.ext.viewcode',\n         'sphinx.ext.coverage',\n         # Add other extensions if needed\n     ]\n     ```\n\n4. **ReStructuredText Plugin for PyCharm:**\n   - If you are using PyCharm Professional, it supports reStructuredText natively. For PyCharm Community, you might need a plugin to properly render reStructuredText (reST) files. Ensure the relevant plugin is installed and enabled.\n\n5. **Check for Any Syntax Errors:**\n   - Verify that there are no syntax errors in your reST files, such as incorrect indentation or spacing. The `.. toctree::` directive should be properly indented.\n\n6. **Rebuild the Documentation:**\n   - Sometimes, simply cleaning and rebuilding the documentation can resolve issues. You can do this by running:\n     ```bash\n     make clean\n     make html\n     ```\n   - This ensures that no stale files are causing issues.\n\n7. **PyCharm Preview Limitations:**\n   - It's important to note that PyCharm's internal preview might not fully support all Sphinx directives, especially if it's a basic text preview. If this is the case, you may need to rely on the browser-based preview for complete functionality.\n\nBy verifying these settings and configurations, you should be able to resolve the issue and get the PyCharm preview working or at least ensure that the HTML output is consistent and as expected. If the problem persists, consider checking the PyCharm documentation or forums for any specific known issues with Sphinx integration."
