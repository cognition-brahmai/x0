For instance, I have a list of suits of cards as follows: `suits = [\"h\",\"c\", \"d\", \"s\"]` and I want to add an 'a' to each suit, so that my result is `aces = [\"ah\",\"ac\", \"ad\", \"as\"]`."

However, both of these approaches technically create a new list because that's how Python handles transformations on lists.\n\nIf you specifically want to modify the list in-place without creating a new list object, you can use list slicing with a combination of list comprehension. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nsuits = [\"h\", \"c\", \"d\", \"s\"]\n\n# Using list comprehension to modify the list in-place\nsuits[:] = [\"a\" + suit for suit in suits]\n\nprint(suits)  # Output: ['ah', 'ac', 'ad', 'as']\n```\n\nThis approach modifies the original list `suits` in place by using slicing (`suits[:]`) to update all elements of the list with the new values. The list comprehension generates the new values without creating a separate list object that is assigned back to `suits`."
