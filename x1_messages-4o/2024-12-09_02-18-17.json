I am following a manual with a minor modification. Instead of using 'virtualenv --python=bin/python2.7 simserver/', I am using 'virtualenv --python=myVirtualEnv/bin/python simserver'. I managed to reach the point where I run 'myVirtualEnv/bin/python bootstrap.py', and then I encounter the error. The error traceback is as follows: \n```\nAn internal error occurred due to a bug in either zc.buildout or in a\nrecipe being used:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/tmp/tmpLiHZgo/zc.buildout-1.6.3-py2.6.egg/zc/buildout/buildout.py\", line 1851, in main\n    command)\n  File \"/tmp/tmpLiHZgo/zc.buildout-1.6.3-py2.6.egg/zc/buildout/buildout.py\", line 203, in __init__\n    data['buildout'].copy(), override, set()))\n  File \"/tmp/tmpLiHZgo/zc.buildout-1.6.3-py2.6.egg/zc/buildout/buildout.py\", line 1465, in _open\n    parser.readfp(fp)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.6/ConfigParser.py\", line 305, in readfp\n    self._read(fp, filename)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.6/ConfigParser.py\", line 482, in _read\n    raise MissingSectionHeaderError(fpname, lineno, line)\nMissingSectionHeaderError: File contains no section headers.\nfile: /home/nenad/buildout.cfg, line: 4\n'<!DOCTYPE html>\\n'\nMint-AMD64 nenad # \n```\nWhat could be the potential issue here?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, `MissingSectionHeaderError: File contains no section headers`, typically indicates that the configuration file (`buildout.cfg` in your case) is not in the expected format. The `ConfigParser` module expects the file to have sections, which are usually indicated by headers enclosed in square brackets (e.g., `[section_name]`).\n\nThe specific line in your error message (`'<!DOCTYPE html>\\n'`) suggests that the file might contain HTML content instead of the expected configuration format. This could happen if the file was accidentally overwritten or if there was an error in fetching or generating the correct file.\n\nHere's how you can address this issue:\n\n1. **Check the `buildout.cfg` File:**\n   - Open the `buildout.cfg` file in a text editor and inspect its contents.\n   - Ensure that it starts with section headers enclosed in square brackets, like `[buildout]`.\n   - If you see HTML content, it likely means the file is not what it should be.\n\n2. **Obtain the Correct `buildout.cfg`:**\n   - If the file contents are incorrect, you'll need to restore it from a correct source.\n   - Check the documentation or source from where you're following the setup instructions to get the proper `buildout.cfg` file.\n\n3. **Verify Paths:**\n   - Make sure that paths are correctly specified in your setup. The modified virtual environment path should be correctly set up.\n\n4. **Re-run the Bootstrap Command:**\n   - After ensuring that the `buildout.cfg` file is correct, try running the `bootstrap.py` command again: `myVirtualEnv/bin/python bootstrap.py`.\n\n5. **Check Python Version:**\n   - Ensure that the Python version being used is compatible with the packages and configurations you're working with.\n\nIf after doing the above steps you still encounter issues, it might be helpful to check for any additional instructions or dependencies that are required for `collective.simserver` and ensure that all prerequisites are met."
