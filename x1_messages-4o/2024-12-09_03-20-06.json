This method will work even if the script is called through a symbolic link:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Get the directory of the script\nSCRIPT_DIR=\"$(cd \"$(dirname \"${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\")\" && pwd)\"\n\n# Change to that directory\ncd \"$SCRIPT_DIR\"\n\n# Now you can operate on files in that directory\n# Your application launch code or other operations go here\n\n# Example: List files in the directory\nls\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` gives you the path of the script being executed.\n- `dirname` extracts the directory path from the full script path.\n- `cd \"$(dirname \"${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\")\"` changes to the directory containing the script.\n- `pwd` prints the current directory after the `cd` command, giving you the absolute path.\n\nThis ensures that your script operates relative to its own location, which is useful when dealing with relative file paths or launching applications that depend on the script's directory."
