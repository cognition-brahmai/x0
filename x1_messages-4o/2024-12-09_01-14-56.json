I have managed to get my implementation working for squared error with sigmoid, tanh and ReLU activation functions and cross entropy (CE) error with sigmoid activation gradient is computed correctly. However, when I change activation to ReLU, it fails. I have also tried to mitigate the problem with the log function at values close to 0 (which is returned by ReLUs approx. 50% of the time for normalized inputs) by using log(max(y,eps)), but this only helped to bring error and gradients back to real numbers, they are still different from numerical gradient. I am verifying the results using numerical gradient: num_grad = (f(W+epsilon) - f(W-epsilon)) / (2*epsilon), but I am still unable to figure out where the problem lies."

        "content": "Implementing backpropagation with ReLU and cross-entropy can be tricky, especially when it comes to handling the non-linearities and ensuring the gradients are correctly computed. Let's go through some common pitfalls and considerations that might help you debug the issue:\n\n1. **ReLU Activation Function:**\n   - The ReLU function is defined as `f(x) = max(0, x)`. Its derivative is `f'(x) = 1` if `x > 0` and `0` otherwise. This means that during backpropagation, any neuron that does not activate (i.e., has an output of 0) will have a gradient of 0, which can lead to \"dead\" neurons that don't update during training. Ensure that your implementation correctly handles these cases.\n\n2. **Cross-Entropy Loss:**\n   - Cross-entropy is typically used with softmax output layers. Ensure that you are applying the softmax activation to your output layer before computing the cross-entropy loss. The gradient of the cross-entropy loss with respect to the logits (pre-softmax activations) is straightforward: `dL/dz = y_pred - y_true`, where `y_pred` is the softmax probability and `y_true` is the true label.\n\n3. **Numerical Stability:**\n   - When computing the log of probabilities, ensure that you're using a small epsilon (e.g., `1e-15`) to prevent taking the log of zero. This seems like something you've already addressed, but it's crucial for stability.\n\n4. **Gradient Check:**\n   - Gradient checking is sensitive to the choice of epsilon. If epsilon is too large, the approximation may not be accurate; if it's too small, numerical precision issues can arise. A common choice is `epsilon = 1e-4`.\n\n5. **Weight Initialization:**\n   - Proper weight initialization is crucial, especially with ReLU activations. Consider using He initialization, which is specifically designed for layers with ReLU activations.\n\n6. **Learning Rate:**\n   - An inappropriate learning rate can cause divergence or very slow convergence. Ensure your learning rate is suitable for your architecture and data.\n\n7. **Implementation Details:**\n   - Double-check the implementation of your forward and backward passes. Specifically, ensure that the chain rule is correctly applied when computing gradients through the network layers.\n\n8. **Batch Size:**\n   - Ensure that gradients are being averaged over the batch rather than summed. This is a common mistake that can lead to discrepancies between analytical and numerical gradients.\n\nTo further debug, you can:\n- Print intermediate activations and gradients for a small batch to see where discrepancies start to appear.\n- Compare the output of each layer and the resultant gradients for both the backpropagation and numerical methods to isolate the layer where the difference begins.\n- Simplify the network (e.g., use fewer layers or neurons) to make it easier to identify problems.\n\nBy systematically checking these aspects, you should be able to pinpoint the issue. Let me know if you need further clarification on any of these points!"
