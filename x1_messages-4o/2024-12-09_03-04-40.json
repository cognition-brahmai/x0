Although the Python tutorial explains slice behavior when indices are negative, I couldn't find any documentation describing the behavior when the end index precedes the start index. From what I've observed, an empty list is returned, but I'm not sure if this is the guaranteed behavior. Would it be reasonable for such a slice to return a list of items between `i` and `j` in reversed order or to simply raise an exception?"

        "content": "Yes, in Python, it is guaranteed that using slice notation with `list[i:j]` will return an empty list if the end index `j` precedes the start index `i`. This behavior is consistent and part of the language's design. According to Python's slice semantics, if the specified start index is greater than or equal to the end index (considering normal non-negative indices), the resulting slice will be empty.\n\nThis is because slices are defined to traverse the list from the start index to the end index in the default step of `1`. If the end index is less than the start index, no traversal can occur, hence the empty result.\n\nIt would not be reasonable or consistent with Python's design for such a slice to return items in reversed order or to raise an exception. The slice mechanism is intentionally forgiving and designed to handle such index situations gracefully by returning an empty list, without raising errors or exceptions. This makes it convenient to work with slices without needing additional checks for index order."
