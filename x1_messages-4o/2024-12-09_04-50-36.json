I tried the following code, but I end up with just the column structure and no data:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame()\ndf['A'] = 1\ndf['B'] = 1.23\ndf['C'] = \"Hello\"\ndf.columns = [['A','B','C']]\n\nprint df\n```\n\nWhen I run the code, I get the following output:\n\n```\nEmpty DataFrame\nColumns: [A, B, C]\nIndex: []\n```\n\nI am aware that there are other ways to create a DataFrame (like from a dictionary), but I'd like to understand why the above code isn't working. Could it be a version issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the way you're trying to add data to your DataFrame. In your current code, you're assigning scalar values to columns of an empty DataFrame, which doesn't automatically create a row. Instead, you should create the DataFrame with a dictionary or a list of dictionaries to ensure the data is correctly structured with rows.\n\nHere's how you can create a DataFrame with a single row using pandas version 0.19.2:\n\n### Using a Dictionary:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create a DataFrame with a dictionary\ndata = {'A': [1], 'B': [1.23], 'C': [\"Hello\"]}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\n### Using a List of Dictionaries:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create a DataFrame with a list of dictionaries\ndata = [{'A': 1, 'B': 1.23, 'C': \"Hello\"}]\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Dictionary Method**: The keys of the dictionary are the column names, and the values are lists containing the data for each column. This method ensures that each column has aligned data.\n\n2. **List of Dictionaries Method**: You can also pass a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a row. This makes it easy to define each row explicitly.\n\nIn both methods, the DataFrame will be created with the intended single row of data without any issues. The reason your original approach didn't work is that simply assigning a scalar to a column of an empty DataFrame doesn't automatically create a row for that scalar value. Instead, it expects an iterable to align data properly across rows."
