        "content": "To develop a high-performance algorithm that processes two input parameters, `num1` and `num2`, we should first define the specific problem or task the algorithm is supposed to solve. Since the task is not explicitly defined, I'll assume a general approach that involves arithmetic operations while considering edge cases and ensuring efficiency.\n\nLet's assume the task involves finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `num1` and `num2`, which is a common and computationally efficient problem. We'll use the Euclidean algorithm, which is known for its simplicity and high performance.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this:\n\n```python\ndef gcd(num1, num2):\n    # Ensure inputs are non-negative integers\n    if not isinstance(num1, int) or not isinstance(num2, int):\n        raise ValueError(\"Both num1 and num2 must be integers.\")\n    if num1 < 0 or num2 < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Both num1 and num2 must be non-negative.\")\n\n    # Handle edge case where both numbers are zero\n    if num1 == 0 and num2 == 0:\n        return 0  # or raise an exception based on your requirements\n\n    # Implement Euclidean algorithm\n    while num2 != 0:\n        num1, num2 = num2, num1 % num2\n\n    return num1\n\n# Example usage\ntry:\n    result = gcd(48, 18)\n    print(f\"The GCD of 48 and 18 is: {result}\")\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(e)\n```\n\n### Key Features of the Algorithm:\n\n1. **Non-Negative Integer Check**: The function ensures that both `num1` and `num2` are non-negative integers. This is important because the GCD is typically defined for non-negative integers.\n\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: The algorithm properly handles edge cases, such as when both numbers are zero. Depending on the application, you might want to return zero or raise an exception in this scenario.\n\n3. **Efficiency**: The Euclidean algorithm is efficient with a time complexity of O(log(min(num1, num2))), making it suitable for large integers.\n\n4. **Robustness**: The function includes error handling to manage invalid input types, ensuring that the algorithm only processes valid data.\n\nThis code block delivers consistent and precise results under various scenarios, leveraging the well-known Euclidean algorithm's efficiency and reliability."
