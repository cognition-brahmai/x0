However, I can't seem to achieve this in a shorter way. Here's my DataFrame structure:\n\n```python\ndf2.dtypes\n\nID                   object\nName                 object\nWeight              float64\nHeight              float64\nBootSize             object\nSuitSize             object\nType                 object\ndtype: object\n```\n\nI have used the following code to replace zero with np.nan which is working:\n\n```python\ndf2.loc[df2['Weight'] == 0,'Weight'] = np.nan\ndf2.loc[df2['Height'] == 0,'Height'] = np.nan\ndf2.loc[df2['BootSize'] == '0','BootSize'] = np.nan\ndf2.loc[df2['SuitSize'] == '0','SuitSize'] = np.nan\n```\n\nBut I believe there should be a more efficient way. I tried the following code, but it did not work. The zeros remain in df2. How should I approach this?\n\n```python\ndf2[[\"Weight\",\"Height\",\"BootSize\",\"SuitSize\"]].astype(str).replace('0',np.nan)\n```"

        "content": "To efficiently replace zeros with `np.nan` in multiple columns of a pandas DataFrame, you can use the `replace` method directly on the DataFrame with a dictionary specifying the columns and the values to be replaced. The issue with your attempt is that the `astype(str)` conversion is done temporarily and not assigned back to the DataFrame. Here's a more efficient and correct way to achieve your goal:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming df2 is your DataFrame\ndf2 = df2.replace({\n    'Weight': {0: np.nan},\n    'Height': {0: np.nan},\n    'BootSize': {'0': np.nan},\n    'SuitSize': {'0': np.nan}\n})\n\n# Alternatively, using a loop for scalability\ncolumns_to_replace = ['Weight', 'Height', 'BootSize', 'SuitSize']\n\nfor column in columns_to_replace:\n    df2[column] = df2[column].replace('0', np.nan).replace(0, np.nan)\n```\n\nThis code will replace all occurrences of `0` in the specified columns with `np.nan`, handling both numeric and string types. The loop method is especially useful if you have many columns to clean up and want to keep your code concise and scalable."
