I found 're.sub' in Python documentation and tried to implement it in the following way:\n\n```python\nimport re\ns = '<textarea id=\"Foo\"></textarea>'\noutput = re.sub(r'<textarea.*>(.*)</textarea>', 'Bar', s)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nMy expectation was that the output would be `'<textarea id=\"Foo\">Bar</textarea>'`. However, I only get `'Bar'`. Can anyone explain what I am doing wrong?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering stems from the way the `re.sub` function is being used. The regular expression pattern you've provided matches the entire content between `<textarea>` and `</textarea>`, including the tags themselves. Therefore, when you replace it with `'Bar'`, the whole match (including the tags) is replaced.\n\nTo only replace the content inside the `<textarea>` tags while keeping the tags themselves, you need to adjust the regular expression pattern to only capture the content between the tags. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport re\ns = '<textarea id=\"Foo\"></textarea>'\noutput = re.sub(r'(<textarea.*?>)(.*?)(</textarea>)', r'\\1Bar\\3', s)\nprint(output)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Pattern Breakdown:**\n   - `(<textarea.*?>)`: This part of the pattern matches the opening `<textarea>` tag. The `.*?` is a non-greedy match for any characters until the first `>`, ensuring only the opening tag is matched.\n   - `(.*?)`: This part matches the content between the opening and closing tags. The `.*?` ensures it's a non-greedy match, capturing as little as possible, which in this case is the content you want to replace.\n   - `(</textarea>)`: This part matches the closing `</textarea>` tag.\n\n2. **Replacement String:**\n   - `r'\\1Bar\\3'`: In the replacement string, `\\1` refers to the first captured group (the opening tag), `Bar` is the new content, and `\\3` refers to the third captured group (the closing tag).\n\nWith this setup, only the content between the `<textarea>` tags is replaced, while the tags themselves are preserved. The output will be `'<textarea id=\"Foo\">Bar</textarea>'`, which matches your expectation."
