I know I can use datetime.timedelta to get a date that is a certain number of days away from a given date, as shown below:\n\n```python\ndaysafter = datetime.date.today() + datetime.timedelta(days=5)\n```\n\nHowever, it seems there's no `datetime.timedelta(month=1)` functionality. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To get the same day of the next month in Python using the `datetime` module, you can use the `relativedelta` function from the `dateutil` module, which is designed to handle more complex date manipulations like adding months or years. Here's how you can do it:\n\nFirst, you'll need to install the `python-dateutil` package if you haven't already. You can do this using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install python-dateutil\n```\n\nThen, you can use the `relativedelta` like so:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta\n\n# Given date\ngiven_date = datetime(2023, 10, 15)\n\n# Get the same day next month\nnext_month_same_day = given_date + relativedelta(months=1)\n\nprint(next_month_same_day)  # Output will be 2023-11-15\n```\n\nThis code snippet will correctly handle the transition to the next month, even for edge cases where the next month might have fewer days. For example, if the given date is January 31, it will correctly roll over to February 28 or 29 depending on whether it's a leap year."
