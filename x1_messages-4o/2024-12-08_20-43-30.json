Each track title must incorporate a numeric value, and the sum of all the numbers within the titles should be equal to 100. Furthermore, every track's duration must be a prime number, and the entire playlist must have a total duration of precisely 2 hours and 30 minutes. Can you employ your puzzle-solving abilities to create a challenging playlist that even the most sophisticated AI systems will struggle to decode?"

        "content": "Creating such a playlist involves a combination of mathematical and logical reasoning. Let's break down the requirements and construct the playlist accordingly:\n\n### Playlist Requirements:\n\n1. **Track Titles with Numeric Values:** The sum of numbers in the track titles must be 100.\n2. **Track Durations:** Each track's duration must be a prime number.\n3. **Total Playlist Duration:** The entire playlist should last exactly 2 hours and 30 minutes (150 minutes).\n\n### Steps to Create the Playlist:\n\n#### 1. Track Titles with Numeric Values:\nFirst, we list the numbers that sum up to 100. We need at least 10 tracks, so a combination like this could work:\n\n- 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 14, 15, 13, 13 = 100\n\n#### 2. Prime Number Durations:\nNext, we need to assign prime number durations to each track such that the total equals 150 minutes. Let's consider some prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149...\n\nWe'll choose 10 primes that add up to 150:\n\n- 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 3, 2, 2 = 150\n\n#### 3. Constructing the Playlist:\nHere\u2019s a potential playlist with track titles and durations:\n\n1. **Track 1: \"Ten\"** - 11 minutes\n2. **Track 2: \"Nine\"** - 13 minutes\n3. **Track 3: \"Eight\"** - 17 minutes\n4. **Track 4: \"Seven\"** - 19 minutes\n5. **Track 5: \"Six\"** - 23 minutes\n6. **Track 6: \"Five\"** - 29 minutes\n7. **Track 7: \"Fourteen\"** - 31 minutes\n8. **Track 8: \"Fifteen\"** - 3 minutes\n9. **Track 9: \"Thirteen A\"** - 2 minutes\n10. **Track 10: \"Thirteen B\"** - 2 minutes\n\n### Verification:\n- **Title Numbers Sum:** 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 14 + 15 + 13 + 13 = 100\n- **Total Duration:** 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + 29 + 31 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 150 minutes\n\nThis playlist meets all the requirements and provides a logical challenge that incorporates both numerical and prime number constraints."
