However, I'm encountering a `RuntimeError` stating 'you must first build vocabulary before training the model'. I understand that the input is supposed to be a list of lists, with the larger list containing smaller lists of tokenized sentences. I've attempted to implement this using a test dataset, but it's not working. The code is as follows:\n\n```python\nsentences = [\"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dogs\",\"yoyoyo you go home now to sleep\"]\nvocab = [s.encode('utf-8').split() for s in sentences]\nvoc_vec = word2vec.Word2Vec(vocab)\n```\n\nDespite my test data having the same structure as the sentences from the Brown corpus, the code isn't functioning as expected. Where am I going wrong?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that the `Word2Vec` model in `gensim` requires you to explicitly build the vocabulary before you can train the model. While you have correctly tokenized your sentences, you missed a step between initializing the model and training it. You need to call the `build_vocab()` method on your `Word2Vec` instance before training.\n\nHere's how you can fix your code:\n\n```python\nfrom gensim.models import Word2Vec\n\n# Tokenize the sentences\nsentences = [\"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dogs\", \"yoyoyo you go home now to sleep\"]\nvocab = [s.split() for s in sentences]  # No need for .encode('utf-8') in Python 3\n\n# Initialize the Word2Vec model\nvoc_vec = Word2Vec(vector_size=100, window=5, min_count=1)\n\n# Build the vocabulary\nvoc_vec.build_vocab(vocab)\n\n# Train the Word2Vec model\nvoc_vec.train(vocab, total_examples=voc_vec.corpus_count, epochs=voc_vec.epochs)\n\n# Now you can use the model\nprint(voc_vec.wv['quick'])  # Example to get the vector for the word 'quick'\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps:\n\n1. **Tokenization**: You've correctly tokenized your sentences into a list of lists format, which is appropriate for `Word2Vec`.\n\n2. **Initializing the Model**: You've initialized the `Word2Vec` model, but it's a good practice to specify parameters like `vector_size`, `window`, and `min_count` based on your needs.\n\n3. **Building Vocabulary**: You need to call `build_vocab()` on your model instance and pass the tokenized sentences. This step prepares the model by analyzing the input data to create the vocabulary.\n\n4. **Training the Model**: Once the vocabulary is built, use the `train()` method to train the model. Ensure you pass the correct parameters like `total_examples` and `epochs` to guide the training process.\n\nWith these steps, your `Word2Vec` model should work as expected."
