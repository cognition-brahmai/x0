How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To extract data from a Highcharts chart using Selenium after setting the axis extremes with `setExtremes`, you'll need to ensure that you're retrieving the data correctly, especially since `setExtremes` is an asynchronous operation. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Wait for the operation to complete**: Since `setExtremes` might trigger a redraw of the chart, you should wait for the rendering to complete before attempting to retrieve the data.\n\n2. **Return data properly**: You might need to access the series data directly instead of trying to chain it in a single `execute_script` call.\n\nHere's an updated version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport time\nfrom selenium import webdriver\n\n# Initialize the WebDriver\ncapabilities = webdriver.DesiredCapabilities().FIREFOX\ncapabilities[\"marionette\"] = True\ndriver = webdriver.Firefox(capabilities=capabilities, executable_path=gecko_binary_path)\ndriver.get(website)\ntime.sleep(5)  # Wait for the charts to load\n\n# Set the extremes\ndriver.execute_script('window.Highcharts.charts[0].xAxis[0].setExtremes(Date.UTC(2017, 0, 7), Date.UTC(2017, 0, 8));')\n\n# Wait for the chart to redraw\ntime.sleep(2)  # You might need to adjust the sleep time\n\n# Retrieve the data after setting extremes\ntemp = driver.execute_script('return window.Highcharts.charts[0].series[0].data.map(point => point.y);')\n\n# Print the data\nprint(temp)\n\n# Clean up\ndriver.quit()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Setting Extremes**: Use `driver.execute_script` to call `setExtremes` without chaining the retrieval of data. This ensures that the extremes are set first.\n- **Wait for Redraw**: After setting the extremes, wait for the chart to redraw. Depending on the complexity and size of the chart, you might need to adjust the sleep duration.\n- **Retrieve Data**: Once the chart is redrawn, you can retrieve the series data. The code uses `map` to extract the `y` values from the data points.\n\nThis approach should help you extract the visible data after setting the axis extremes. Adjust the timing and data access according to the specifics of your chart and page."
