You can create a function in Python that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list where each element is the square (product of itself) of the corresponding element from the input list. Here's one way to do it:\n\n```python\ndef square_elements(numbers):\n    return [number * number for number in numbers]\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\noutput_list = square_elements(input_list)\nprint(output_list)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n```\n\nThis function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list, calculates the square of each number, and creates a new list with these squared values."
