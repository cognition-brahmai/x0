        "content": "To query your SQL database to retrieve data on social media usage and adolescent depression, you'll need to have a schema or structure in place that includes tables related to social media activity and mental health outcomes. Here's a simplified example of how you might structure a query:\n\nAssuming your database includes tables like `SocialMediaUsage` and `MentalHealthSurveys`, you might have columns such as `user_id`, `usage_hours`, `platform`, `depression_score`, `survey_date`, etc.\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    SM.user_id,\n    SM.platform,\n    SM.usage_hours,\n    MH.depression_score,\n    MH.survey_date\nFROM \n    SocialMediaUsage SM\nJOIN \n    MentalHealthSurveys MH ON SM.user_id = MH.user_id\nWHERE \n    MH.survey_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'\nORDER BY \n    MH.depression_score DESC;\n```\n\nThis query joins the `SocialMediaUsage` and `MentalHealthSurveys` tables on `user_id`, selecting data for a specific year and ordering the results by depression score in descending order.\n\nBased on the results of the query, here are two potential research paper titles:\n\n1. \"The Impact of Social Media Platform Usage on Adolescent Depression: A Year-Long Analysis\"\n2. \"Correlational Study of Screen Time and Depression Levels Among Adolescents in 2023\"\n\nThese titles reflect a focus on the relationship between social media usage and depression, which could be explored further in your research paper."
