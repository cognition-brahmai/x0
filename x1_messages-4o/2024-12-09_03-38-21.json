However, when I try to import the built-in class using \"from calendar import Calendar\", it tries to load from my own module instead of the built-in one. How can I import from the built-in library when a module with the same name exists in my project without having to rename my module?"

To import the built-in `Calendar` class from the Python standard library instead of your own module, you can use the `importlib` library, which allows you to import modules in a more controlled manner. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport importlib\n\n# Import the built-in calendar module using importlib\ncalendar_module = importlib.import_module('calendar')\n\n# Access the Calendar class from the built-in calendar module\nCalendar = calendar_module.Calendar\n\n# Now you can use the Calendar class as intended\ncal = Calendar()\n```\n\nBy using `importlib.import_module`, you can explicitly specify that you want to import the standard library's `calendar` module, bypassing your local module with the same name."
