I am trying to achieve the same result as I would with `torch.add.at(warped_image, (iy, ix), image)`. Here is my current code:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimage = torch.tensor([[246,  50, 101], [116,   1, 113], [187, 110,  64]])\niy = torch.tensor([[1, 0, 2], [1, 0, 2], [2, 2, 2]])\nix = torch.tensor([[0, 2, 1], [1, 2, 0], [0, 1, 2]])\nwarped_image = torch.zeros(size=image.shape)\n```\n\nI want to get the output as \n\n```python\n[[  0.   0.  51.]\n [246. 116.   0.]\n [300. 211.  64.]]\n```\n\nGiven that the indices at `(0,1)` and `(1,1)` point to the same location `(0,2)`, I want to have `warped_image[0,2] = image[0,1] + image[1,1] = 51`. How can I achieve this in Pytorch?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired behavior in PyTorch, where you want to add values from one tensor to another tensor at specified indices, you can utilize the `scatter_add_` method. This method allows you to perform element-wise addition at specified indices and handles overlapping indices by summing the values.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired output:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\n# Original image tensor\nimage = torch.tensor([[246,  50, 101], [116,   1, 113], [187, 110,  64]])\n\n# Indices for the y and x positions\niy = torch.tensor([[1, 0, 2], [1, 0, 2], [2, 2, 2]])\nix = torch.tensor([[0, 2, 1], [1, 2, 0], [0, 1, 2]])\n\n# Initialize the warped image with zeros\nwarped_image = torch.zeros(size=image.shape, dtype=torch.float32)\n\n# Use scatter_add_ to add values at specified indices\nwarped_image.index_put_((iy, ix), image, accumulate=True)\n\nprint(warped_image)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`scatter_add_` Method**: This method is useful for adding values to specific indices in a tensor. However, since `scatter_add_` is typically used for one-dimensional indices, we use `index_put_` with `accumulate=True`, which is essentially adding the values at the specified indices.\n  \n- **`index_put_` Method**: This method allows you to set values at specific indices, and using `accumulate=True` allows accumulating the values rather than simply replacing them.\n\nThis will give you the desired `warped_image` where overlapping indices lead to the summation of corresponding values:\n\n```python\ntensor([[  0.,   0.,  51.],\n        [246., 116.,   0.],\n        [300., 211.,  64.]])\n```\n\nThis code should work as intended and provide the summation behavior you are looking for with overlapping indices."
