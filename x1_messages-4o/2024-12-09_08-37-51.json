        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this by using the `zip()` function in Python. The `zip()` function can be used to iterate over pairs of consecutive elements in a list. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired output:\n\n```python\na = [5, 7, 11, 4, 5]\n\n# Iterate over pairs of consecutive elements\nfor v, w in zip(a, a[1:]):\n    print([v, w])\n```\n\nHere's what this code does:\n\n- `a[1:]` creates a new list that starts from the second element of the original list `a`.\n- `zip(a, a[1:])` pairs each element in the original list `a` with the subsequent element in `a[1:]`.\n- The `for` loop iterates over these pairs, allowing you to print them as desired.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will produce the expected output:\n\n```\n[5, 7]\n[7, 11]\n[11, 4]\n[4, 5]\n```"
