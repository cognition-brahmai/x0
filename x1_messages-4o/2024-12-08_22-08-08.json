        "content": "In Ruby, you can incorporate a prepositional phrase into a given sentence by using string interpolation or concatenation. In this case, you want to add a phrase that explains the rationale behind John's visit to the store.\n\nHere's how you can do it using string interpolation:\n\n```ruby\n# Define the rationale behind John's visit\nrationale = \"to buy groceries\"\n\n# Create a sentence with the rationale using string interpolation\nsentence = \"John went to the store #{rationale}.\"\n\n# Output the sentence\nputs sentence\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Define the Rationale**: \n   - We start by defining a variable `rationale` that holds the prepositional phrase explaining why John went to the store. In this example, it's `\"to buy groceries\"`.\n\n2. **String Interpolation**:\n   - String interpolation in Ruby is done using the `#{}` syntax within a double-quoted string. By placing the `rationale` variable inside `#{}`, we dynamically insert its value into the main sentence string.\n   - The sentence `\"John went to the store #{rationale}.\"` uses interpolation to insert the value of `rationale` right after \"store\".\n\n3. **Output the Sentence**:\n   - The `puts` method is used to print the final sentence to the console.\n\nUsing this approach, you can easily change the `rationale` variable to any other reason, and the sentence will automatically update to reflect that change. For example, if you change `rationale` to `\"to pick up a package\"`, the output will be `\"John went to the store to pick up a package.\"`.\n\nThis method provides flexibility and clarity, making it easy to incorporate various prepositional phrases into sentences dynamically."
