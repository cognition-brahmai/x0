What is the range of values for which this condition holds true? I experimented with binary search to find the smallest number for which hash(n) is not equal to n and found it to be 2305843009213693951. This value is less than sys.maxsize. What is the significance of this number? On Python 2, I got a different result, 2147483648, which is equal to sys.maxint+1. Also, the range of the hash function seems to be consistently below n. Additionally, it appears that Python 3's hash function always returns positive values, whereas Python 2's hash function can return negative values."

        "content": "The behavior you're observing with Python's `hash()` function for integers is related to how Python implements hashing for numbers. Let's break down your observations:\n\n1. **Python 3 Hash Function for Integers**:\n   - In Python 3, the `hash()` function returns the integer itself if it fits within the platform's `Py_ssize_t` range, which typically corresponds to the platform's pointer size (e.g., 64-bit or 32-bit).\n   - For larger integers, Python 3 uses a different algorithm to ensure that the hash value fits within the range of a signed `Py_ssize_t`. This is why you see `hash(2**100)` not equal to `2**100`.\n   - The number you found, `2305843009213693951`, is interesting because it's the largest Mersenne prime that fits in a 63-bit signed integer. Python uses this value as a modulus to ensure that the hash fits within the 64-bit signed integer range.\n\n2. **Python 2 Hash Function for Integers**:\n   - In Python 2, the hash value is simply the integer itself modulo `2**32`, which is why you see the hash diverge at `sys.maxint + 1` (which is `2**31` for 32-bit systems).\n   - Python 2 allows negative hash values because the result of the modulo operation can be negative if the original number was negative.\n\n3. **Positive Hash Values in Python 3**:\n   - Python 3 makes an effort to ensure that hash values are non-negative. This is achieved by using a different hash algorithm for large integers, which involves taking the modulus with a large prime number, ensuring that the result is positive.\n\n4. **Significance of `2305843009213693951`**:\n   - This number is significant because it represents the largest value for which `hash(n) == n` holds true on a 64-bit system in Python 3. Beyond this, Python switches to a different hashing strategy to ensure the result fits within a 63-bit signed integer.\n\nOverall, Python's handling of the `hash()` function aims to provide a consistent and manageable range of hash values, balancing the need for performance with the constraints of typical integer sizes on modern systems."
