        "content": "The error you're encountering indicates that the compiler can't find the Python header files needed to compile the C extension. This typically means that either the Python development package isn't properly installed or the compiler isn't looking in the right place.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to resolve the issue on CentOS:\n\n1. **Check Python Version**: First, make sure you're installing the correct development package for your version of Python. If you're using Python 3, you'll need to install the `python3-devel` package instead of `python-devel`.\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo yum install python3-devel\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify Installation**: Double-check that the development package is installed correctly. You can verify this by checking if the `Python.h` file exists. You can use the `find` command to search for it:\n\n   ```bash\n   find /usr/include -name \"Python.h\"\n   ```\n\n   This should return a path like `/usr/include/python3.x/Python.h` or similar, depending on your Python version.\n\n3. **Set Environment Variables**: If the header files are installed but not being found, you might need to set the `C_INCLUDE_PATH` environment variable to include the directory where `Python.h` resides.\n\n   ```bash\n   export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/python3.x\n   ```\n\n   Replace `python3.x` with your actual Python version directory.\n\n4. **Specify Include Path in Compilation**: When compiling your C extension, make sure to specify the include path using the `-I` flag if needed. For example:\n\n   ```bash\n   gcc -I/usr/include/python3.x -o my_extension my_extension.c -lpython3.x\n   ```\n\n   Again, replace `python3.x` with your actual Python version.\n\n5. **Use the Correct Python Executable**: When you build the extension, make sure you're using the correct Python executable to invoke the build process. This ensures that the build process uses the correct include and library paths. For example, use:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 setup.py build\n   ```\n\n   Or specify the full path to the Python executable if necessary.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the \"Python.h: No such file or directory\" error on your CentOS machine. If the problem persists, double-check your paths and ensure there are no typos or incorrect version numbers."
