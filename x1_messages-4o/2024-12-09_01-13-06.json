However, I am encountering an issue where the output HTML is not preserving the line breaks which are present in the docstring. For example, consider the following code:\n\n```\ndef testMethod(arg1,arg2):\n    \"\"\"\n    This is a test method\n\n    Arguments:\n    arg1: arg1 description\n    arg2: arg2 description\n\n    Returns:\n    None\n    \"\"\"\n    print \"I am a test method\"\n```\n\nWhen I run Sphinx, the output that I get is as follows:\n\n```\nTestModule.testMethod(arg1, arg2)\n\nThis is a test method\n\nArguments: arg1: arg1 description arg2: arg2 description\n\nReturns: None\n```\n\nAs you can see, the line breaks in the Arguments section are not being preserved. How can I fix this?"

        "content": "To ensure that the line breaks in your docstrings are preserved when generating HTML documentation with Sphinx, you can use reStructuredText (reST) syntax. This is necessary because Sphinx relies on reST for formatting. Here are some steps and tips to help you maintain the line breaks and improve the formatting of your documentation:\n\n1. **Use Bullet Points or Definition Lists for Arguments:**\n   You can use bullet points or a definition list to clearly separate each argument in the Arguments section. This makes it easier for Sphinx to interpret the line breaks correctly.\n\n   Example using a definition list:\n   ```python\n   def testMethod(arg1, arg2):\n       \"\"\"\n       This is a test method\n\n       Arguments:\n           arg1: \n               arg1 description\n           arg2: \n               arg2 description\n\n       Returns:\n           None\n       \"\"\"\n       print(\"I am a test method\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Indentation:**\n   Proper indentation is crucial in reST. Make sure each line under an argument or return statement is indented consistently.\n\n3. **Use Explicit Markup:**\n   If you prefer a more structured format, consider using the `:param:` and `:return:` directives provided by Sphinx:\n\n   ```python\n   def testMethod(arg1, arg2):\n       \"\"\"\n       This is a test method\n\n       :param arg1: arg1 description\n       :param arg2: arg2 description\n       :returns: None\n       \"\"\"\n       print(\"I am a test method\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Configure Sphinx (if needed):**\n   Ensure your `conf.py` is correctly set up to recognize and process docstrings properly. You may need to check if any extensions or configurations affect how docstrings are parsed.\n\n5. **Rebuild the Documentation:**\n   After making changes, remember to rebuild your documentation with Sphinx to see the updates.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to achieve the desired formatting in your Sphinx-generated HTML documentation."
