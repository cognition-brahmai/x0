In Python, I have the following code that uses a decorator:\n\n```python\n#! /usr/bin/env python\n\nimport math\n\ndef document(f):\n    def wrap(x):\n        print \"I am going to square\", x\n        f(x)\n    return wrap\n\n@document\ndef square(x):\n    print math.pow(x, 2)\n\nsquare(5)\n```\n\nWhen I run this, I get:\n\n```python\nI am going to square 5\n25.0\n```\n\nIn other words, I want to create a function `square(x)`, but decorate it so it alerts me as to what it's going to square before it does it. Without the decorator, the Python code would look like:\n\n```python\n...\ndef square(x):\n    print math.pow(x, 2)\nsquare = document(square)\n...\n```\n\nTo replicate this in Ruby, I made the following attempt:\n\n```ruby\n#! /usr/bin/env ruby\n\ndef document(f)\n    def wrap(x)\n        puts \"I am going to square\", x\n        f(x)\n        end\n    return wrap\n    end\n\ndef square(x)\n    puts x**2\n    end\n\nsquare = document(square)\n\nsquare(5)\n```\n\nBut running this gives me the error:\n\n```ruby\n./ruby_decorate.rb:8:in `document': wrong number of arguments (0 for 1) (ArgumentError)\n    from ./ruby_decorate.rb:15:in `<main>'\n```\n\nI'm guessing this is because parentheses aren't mandatory in Ruby and it's taking my `return wrap` as an attempt to `return wrap()`. I'm unsure how to refer to a function without calling it. How can I replicate the Python decorator functionality in Ruby?"

        "content": "To achieve decorator-like functionality in Ruby, you need to understand that Ruby handles functions and closures differently than Python. In Ruby, methods are not first-class objects like they are in Python. However, you can achieve similar functionality using blocks, Procs, or lambdas. Let's see how you can replicate the Python decorator example in Ruby.\n\nHere is one way to implement the decorator pattern in Ruby using Procs:\n\n```ruby\n#! /usr/bin/env ruby\n\n# Define a method to wrap another method with additional behavior\ndef document(f)\n  # Return a new Proc that takes an argument x\n  Proc.new do |x|\n    puts \"I am going to square #{x}\"\n    f.call(x) # Call the original function with the argument\n  end\nend\n\n# Define the original method\nsquare = Proc.new do |x|\n  puts x**2\nend\n\n# Apply the decorator\nsquare = document(square)\n\n# Call the decorated method\nsquare.call(5)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Proc Object**: In Ruby, `Proc` is an object that encapsulates a block of code, which can be stored in a variable and called later. Here, `square` is defined as a `Proc`.\n\n2. **Document Function**: The `document` function takes a `Proc` object as its argument and returns a new `Proc`. This new `Proc` adds additional behavior (printing a message) before calling the original `Proc`.\n\n3. **Calling a Proc**: To execute the `Proc`, you use the `call` method with the appropriate arguments.\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- Unlike Python, Ruby does not allow you to directly pass method references as arguments in the same way. Instead, you use `Proc`, `lambda`, or blocks to achieve similar functionality.\n- Using `Proc` allows you to encapsulate the behavior and then apply additional functionality, similar to how decorators work in Python.\n\nThis approach effectively mimics Python's decorator pattern in Ruby, allowing you to add pre-execution logic to methods without modifying their internal code directly."
