I have tried the following code:\n\n```python\nurl = 'http://myserver/post_service'\ndata = urllib.urlencode({'name' : 'joe',\n                         'age'  : '10'})\ncontent = urllib2.urlopen(url=url, data=data).read()\nprint content\n```\n\nDespite this, the server logs indicate that I'm making GET calls even though I'm sending the data argument to urlopen. I am receiving a 404 error (not found), which is correct for a GET call. POST calls work fine when I try them within an HTML form."

        "content": "To make a POST request using `urllib2` in Python 2, your approach is mostly correct, but it's important to ensure that the server is indeed receiving the data in the correct format and that the headers are set appropriately. Since `urllib2` is used in Python 2, let's make sure everything is in place.\n\nHere's a revised version of your code to make a POST request:\n\n```python\nimport urllib\nimport urllib2\n\nurl = 'http://myserver/post_service'\ndata = {'name': 'joe', 'age': '10'}\n# Encode the data to a URL-encoded format\nencoded_data = urllib.urlencode(data)\n\n# Create a Request object\nrequest = urllib2.Request(url, data=encoded_data)\n\n# Optionally, add headers (e.g., Content-Type) if the server expects them\nrequest.add_header('Content-Type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded')\n\n# Perform the request\ntry:\n    response = urllib2.urlopen(request)\n    content = response.read()\n    print(content)\nexcept urllib2.HTTPError as e:\n    print('HTTPError: {}'.format(e.code))\nexcept urllib2.URLError as e:\n    print('URLError: {}'.format(e.reason))\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **`urllib.urlencode`**: Ensure you're encoding the data correctly. The `urlencode` function converts a dictionary into a query string, which is suitable for form-encoded data.\n\n2. **`urllib2.Request`**: Use `Request` to create a request object for a POST call. When you pass data to `urlopen`, it automatically treats the request as a POST.\n\n3. **Headers**: Ensure that any required headers (like `Content-Type`) are added to your request. The default is 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded', which is usually what is needed for POST requests.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: Use try-except blocks to handle potential HTTP and URL errors gracefully.\n\nIf you've ensured all of the above and the problem persists, double-check with your server logs to verify if the request is being interpreted correctly and that the endpoint is accepting POST requests. If possible, you can also use tools like `curl` to manually test POST requests to your server to ensure it responds as expected."
