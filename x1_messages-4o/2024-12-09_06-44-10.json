I am interested in specifying different permissions for each method within a class based view. I have referred to the documentation and found that it is quite straightforward to implement this with function based views using the `@permission_classes` decorator. However, with class based views using the `APIView` class, the `permission_classes` attribute applies the permissions to all class methods such as `get`, `post`, `put`, etc. Is it possible to have different permissions for each method within a class based view?"

        "content": "Yes, you can specify different permissions for each method within a class-based view in Django REST Framework by overriding the `get_permissions` method. This approach allows you to dynamically determine the permissions based on the request method. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom rest_framework import permissions\nfrom rest_framework.views import APIView\n\nclass MyCustomView(APIView):\n    # Default permission classes if needed\n    permission_classes = [permissions.IsAuthenticated]\n\n    def get_permissions(self):\n        if self.request.method == 'GET':\n            return [permissions.IsAuthenticated()]\n        elif self.request.method == 'POST':\n            return [permissions.AllowAny()]\n        elif self.request.method == 'PUT':\n            return [permissions.IsAdminUser()]\n        return super().get_permissions()\n\n    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n        # Your GET logic\n        pass\n\n    def post(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n        # Your POST logic\n        pass\n\n    def put(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n        # Your PUT logic\n        pass\n```\n\nIn this example, the `get_permissions` method checks the HTTP method of the incoming request and returns a list of permission instances specific to that method. Here's a breakdown:\n\n- `GET` requests require the user to be authenticated.\n- `POST` requests are allowed for any user (no authentication required).\n- `PUT` requests require the user to have admin rights.\n\nBy customizing the `get_permissions` method, you can tailor the permission logic for each HTTP method in your class-based view."
