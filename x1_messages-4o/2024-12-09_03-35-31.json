This is the code I've tried:\n\n```python\nimport collections\nd = defaultdict(int)\n```\n\nWhen I run this code, I get the following error:\n\n```python\nNameError: name 'defaultdict' is not defined\n```\n\nI am certain that the collections module is being imported correctly since running 'collections' results in `<module 'collections' from '/usr/lib/python3.2/collections.py'>`. Also, when I use the help function on collections, it shows me the defaultdict class. Why am I encountering this issue and how can I resolve it?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that you are trying to use `defaultdict` without fully qualifying it with the module name or without importing it directly. When you import a module using `import collections`, you need to access its members using the module name as a prefix.\n\nHere's how you can fix your code:\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\nd = collections.defaultdict(int)\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer to use `defaultdict` directly without the `collections` prefix, you can import it explicitly:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nd = defaultdict(int)\n```\n\nBoth approaches will work correctly and resolve the `NameError` you encountered. Using either of these import statements will allow you to create a `defaultdict` instance without errors."
