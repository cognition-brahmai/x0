        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the way you're passing the `args` parameter to the `threading.Thread` constructor. In the line where you are creating the thread for the `myfunc` function, you're passing `args=(q)` which is not a tuple. In Python, a single value in parentheses is just that value, not a tuple. To create a tuple with a single element, you need to include a comma.\n\nHere's how you can fix it:\n\nChange the line:\n\n```python\nthread = threading.Thread(target=myfunc, args=(q))\n```\n\nto:\n\n```python\nthread = threading.Thread(target=myfunc, args=(q,))\n```\n\nNotice the comma after `q`. This tells Python to treat it as a tuple with a single element, which is necessary for the `args` parameter in `threading.Thread`.\n\nThis should resolve the `TypeError` you're seeing because `args` will now be correctly interpreted as a sequence containing one element, `q`."
