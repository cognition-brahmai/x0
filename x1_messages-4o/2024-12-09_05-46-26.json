My current code looks like this:\n```python\nprint(img.size)\nprint(10 * img.size)\n```\nThe output I get is a repeated tuple:\n```python\n(70, 70)\n(70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70)\n```\nHowever, I want the output to be a tuple where each element is multiplied by the scalar, like so:\n```python\n(700, 700)\n```\nIs there a method to achieve this without having to manually multiply each element of the tuple like this?\n```python\nprint(10 * img.size[0], 10 * img.size[1])\n```\nNote: `img.size` is a PIL image size."

        "content": "Certainly! To multiply each element of a tuple by a scalar in Python, you can use a comprehension or the `map` function. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n### Using a Tuple Comprehension:\n```python\nnew_size = tuple(10 * x for x in img.size)\nprint(new_size)\n```\n\n### Using the `map` Function:\n```python\nnew_size = tuple(map(lambda x: x * 10, img.size))\nprint(new_size)\n```\n\nBoth of these methods will give you the desired output, where each element of the tuple is multiplied by the scalar, resulting in `(700, 700)` if the original size was `(70, 70)`."
