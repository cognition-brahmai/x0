I have built an older version of GCC (5.3.0) and installed it in my home directory, specifically at ~/local/gcc-5.3.0. However, I only need this compiler for CUDA projects, and I will be using the system compiler (GCC 6.2.1) for all other tasks. I'm looking for a way to switch between these compilers as needed, and in a way that also changes the library and include paths appropriately. I know that update-alternatives is one possible method, but I don't have root permissions to set it up. Could I solve this by writing a shell function in .bashrc that switches between system and local gcc and adjusts paths accordingly? If so, what paths should I set while implementing such a function?"

        "content": "Yes, you can definitely use a shell function in your `.bashrc` to switch between different GCC versions without needing root permissions. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set this up:\n\n1. **Edit Your .bashrc File:**\n   Open your `.bashrc` file located in your home directory. You can use a text editor like `nano` or `vim`:\n\n   ```bash\n   nano ~/.bashrc\n   ```\n\n2. **Add Functions to Switch GCC Versions:**\n   Add the following shell functions to your `.bashrc`. These functions will update the `PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and `C_INCLUDE_PATH` (or `CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH` for C++) to switch between your system GCC and the locally installed GCC.\n\n   ```bash\n   # Function to switch to GCC 5.3.0\n   function use_gcc_5_3_0() {\n       export PATH=~/local/gcc-5.3.0/bin:$PATH\n       export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/local/gcc-5.3.0/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n       export C_INCLUDE_PATH=~/local/gcc-5.3.0/include:$C_INCLUDE_PATH\n       export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=~/local/gcc-5.3.0/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH\n       echo \"Switched to GCC 5.3.0\"\n   }\n\n   # Function to switch to system GCC\n   function use_system_gcc() {\n       # Assuming default system paths, adjust if necessary\n       export PATH=$(echo $PATH | sed -e 's|~/local/gcc-5.3.0/bin:||')\n       export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH | sed -e 's|~/local/gcc-5.3.0/lib64:||')\n       export C_INCLUDE_PATH=$(echo $C_INCLUDE_PATH | sed -e 's|~/local/gcc-5.3.0/include:||')\n       export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$(echo $CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH | sed -e 's|~/local/gcc-5.3.0/include:||')\n       echo \"Switched to system GCC\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Save and Apply Changes:**\n   After adding these functions, save the changes and exit the text editor. To apply the changes, source your `.bashrc`:\n\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bashrc\n   ```\n\n4. **Switch GCC Versions:**\n   You can now switch between the GCC versions by calling the functions in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   use_gcc_5_3_0   # Switch to GCC 5.3.0\n   use_system_gcc  # Switch back to the system GCC\n   ```\n\nBy using these functions, you can easily toggle between different GCC versions and ensure that all the necessary paths are updated accordingly. This setup allows for flexibility without the need for administrative privileges."
