        "content": "Creating a table in Excel to calculate total sales revenue, profit, and profit margin for each product category involves several steps. Here\u2019s a guide to help you set up your table and formulas:\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Your Data Table\n\nAssuming you have raw data with columns such as \"Product Category,\" \"Sales Revenue,\" and \"Cost of Goods Sold\", you can create a summary table as follows:\n\n1. **Column Headers**: \n   - A1: Product Category\n   - B1: Total Sales Revenue\n   - C1: Total Cost of Goods Sold\n   - D1: Total Profit\n   - E1: Profit Margin (%)\n\n2. **Rows**:\n   - Start listing your product categories in column A from A2 downward.\n\n### Step 2: Enter Formulas\n\n3. **Total Sales Revenue for Each Category**:\n   - In cell B2, use the `SUMIFS` function to calculate the total sales revenue for each product category. The formula would look like this:\n     ```excel\n     =SUMIFS(SalesRevenueRange, ProductCategoryRange, A2)\n     ```\n   - Replace `SalesRevenueRange` and `ProductCategoryRange` with the actual ranges from your raw data.\n\n4. **Total Cost of Goods Sold for Each Category**:\n   - In cell C2, use the `SUMIFS` function similarly:\n     ```excel\n     =SUMIFS(CostOfGoodsSoldRange, ProductCategoryRange, A2)\n     ```\n\n5. **Total Profit for Each Category**:\n   - In cell D2, calculate the profit by subtracting the Total Cost of Goods Sold from the Total Sales Revenue:\n     ```excel\n     =B2 - C2\n     ```\n\n6. **Profit Margin for Each Category**:\n   - In cell E2, calculate the profit margin as:\n     ```excel\n     =IF(B2<>0, (D2 / B2) * 100, 0)\n     ```\n   - This formula ensures that you don't divide by zero, which would cause an error.\n\n### Step 3: Fill Down the Formulas\n\n7. **Fill Down**: \n   - Select the cells B2 to E2 and drag the fill handle down to apply the formulas to the other rows corresponding to each product category.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Overall Totals\n\n8. **Overall Totals**:\n   - In the row immediately below your last product category, you can calculate the overall totals:\n     - Total Sales Revenue: `=SUM(B2:B[LastRow])`\n     - Total Cost of Goods Sold: `=SUM(C2:C[LastRow])`\n     - Total Profit: `=SUM(D2:D[LastRow])`\n     - The overall Profit Margin can be calculated by using the total profit and total sales revenue:\n       ```excel\n       =IF(SUM(B2:B[LastRow])<>0, (SUM(D2:D[LastRow]) / SUM(B2:B[LastRow])) * 100, 0)\n       ```\n\nReplace `[LastRow]` with the actual last row number of your data.\n\nThis setup will give you a dynamic summary table that updates automatically as you modify your raw data. Ensure all your data ranges are correctly set, especially if your raw data is on a different sheet."
