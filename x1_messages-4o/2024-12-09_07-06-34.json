When I use the insert() method, it updates the list in place and does not return the updated list. Is there a way to insert an element at a specific index and get the updated list as the result, instead of updating the original list in place? For example:\n\n```python\na = [1, 2, 4]\nprint(a)\nprint(a.insert(2, 3))\nprint(a)\nb = a.insert(3, 6)\nprint(b)\nprint(a)\n```\n\nThe output of this code is:\n```python\n[1, 2, 4]\nNone\n[1, 2, 3, 4]\nNone\n[1, 2, 3, 6, 4]\n```\nAs you can see, the insert() method does not return the updated list. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "The `insert()` method in Python modifies the list in place and returns `None`, which is why you see `None` as the output when you try to assign the result of `insert()` to a variable. If you want to insert an element and get the updated list without modifying the original list, you can create a new list that incorporates the insertion. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef insert_and_return_new_list(lst, index, element):\n    # Create a new list with the element inserted at the specified index\n    new_list = lst[:index] + [element] + lst[index:]\n    return new_list\n\na = [1, 2, 4]\nprint(a)  # Original list\nb = insert_and_return_new_list(a, 2, 3)\nprint(b)  # New list with the element inserted\nprint(a)  # Original list remains unchanged\n\nc = insert_and_return_new_list(b, 3, 6)\nprint(c)  # Another new list after second insertion\nprint(b)  # Previous new list remains unchanged\n```\n\nOutput:\n```python\n[1, 2, 4]\n[1, 2, 3, 4]\n[1, 2, 4]\n[1, 2, 3, 6, 4]\n[1, 2, 3, 4]\n```\n\nThis way, you can insert an element at a specific index and get a new list with the updated elements, leaving the original list unchanged."
