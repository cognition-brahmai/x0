        "content": "To convert your C++ code to run on an NVIDIA GPU using CUDA, you need to rewrite the code with CUDA-specific constructs. This involves using `__device__` and `__global__` qualifiers and ensuring that memory allocations and function calls are compatible with the GPU architecture. Below is the modified code:\n\n```cpp\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n// Declare device function pointers\n__device__ double (*d_func[3])(double x);\n\n// Define device functions\n__device__ double func1(double x) {\n    return x + 1.0;\n}\n\n__device__ double func2(double x) {\n    return x + 2.0;\n}\n\n__device__ double func3(double x) {\n    return x + 3.0;\n}\n\n// CUDA kernel\n__global__ void test() {\n    // Array of device function pointers\n    double (*func[3])(double x);\n    func[0] = func1;\n    func[1] = func2;\n    func[2] = func3;\n\n    double x;\n    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;\n\n    // Ensure we only run the loop for valid indices\n    if (i < 3) {\n        x = func[i](2.0);\n        printf(\"%g\\n\", x);\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    // Launch the kernel with a single block and three threads\n    test<<<1, 3>>>();\n\n    // Wait for GPU to finish before accessing on host\n    cudaDeviceSynchronize();\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Device Functions**: The functions `func1`, `func2`, and `func3` are marked with `__device__`, indicating they will run on the GPU.\n\n2. **Kernel Launch**: The `test` function is now a `__global__` kernel function, which means it will be executed on the device. You launch it with `<<<1, 3>>>`, which means one block with three threads, each corresponding to one of the function calls.\n\n3. **Function Pointer Array**: In the kernel, we define an array `func` that holds pointers to the device functions. Each thread accesses the function based on its index.\n\n4. **Synchronization**: We use `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` in the host code to ensure the kernel completes execution before the program terminates.\n\n5. **Printing from Device**: The `printf` function can be used in device code with CUDA, but remember it is not as fast as host-side printing operations.\n\nThis CUDA code should run on your NVIDIA GeForce GTS 450, which supports compute capability 2.1. Make sure to compile this with `nvcc`, the NVIDIA CUDA compiler, and link against the necessary CUDA libraries."
