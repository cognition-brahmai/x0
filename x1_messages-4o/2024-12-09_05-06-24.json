I was trying to install pycurl in a virtualenv using pip and ran into this error: \"ImportError: pycurl: libcurl link-time ssl backend (openssl) is different from compile-time ssl backend (none/other)\". According to the documentation I read, I need to tell setup.py what SSL backend is used, but I'm not sure how to do this as I installed pycurl using pip. How can I specify the SSL backend when installing pycurl with pip?"

        "content": "When you encounter the error where the libcurl link-time SSL backend is different from the compile-time SSL backend, it often means that the version of PycURL you are trying to install is not compatible with the SSL backend used by your system's libcurl. To resolve this, you can specify the SSL backend during the installation process by setting an environment variable. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Uninstall any existing pycurl installation** in your virtual environment to start fresh:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall pycurl\n   ```\n\n2. **Set the `PYCURL_SSL_LIBRARY` environment variable** to specify the SSL backend. Since you want to use OpenSSL, set it as follows:\n\n   On macOS or Linux:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PYCURL_SSL_LIBRARY=openssl\n   ```\n\n   On Windows:\n\n   ```cmd\n   set PYCURL_SSL_LIBRARY=openssl\n   ```\n\n3. **Install pycurl using pip with the environment variable set**:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pycurl\n   ```\n\nBy setting the `PYCURL_SSL_LIBRARY` environment variable to `openssl`, you are telling the setup script to build PycURL with OpenSSL support, matching the SSL backend used by your system's libcurl.\n\nAdditionally, ensure that your system's libcurl is actually compiled with OpenSSL. You can check this by running:\n\n```bash\ncurl -V\n```\n\nLook for the SSL library being used in the output. If it doesn't show OpenSSL, you might need to install or compile a version of libcurl that does.\n\nIf you continue to face issues, consider using a precompiled wheel for your platform, which you might find on PyPI or other sources, as these often resolve compatibility issues with SSL backends."
