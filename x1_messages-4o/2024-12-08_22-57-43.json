Here's a refined version of the code with additional details:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'rest-client'\nrequire 'json'\n\n# Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual Yelp API key\nAPI_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'\n\n# Define a method to search for restaurants by name\ndef search_restaurants(name, location = 'New York')\n  url = 'https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/search'\n\n  # Set up query parameters\n  params = {\n    term: name,\n    location: location,\n    limit: 5 # You can adjust the limit as needed\n  }\n\n  # Make a GET request to the Yelp API\n  response = RestClient.get(\n    url,\n    {\n      Authorization: \"Bearer #{API_KEY}\",\n      params: params\n    }\n  )\n\n  # Parse the JSON response\n  data = JSON.parse(response.body)\n\n  # Iterate over the businesses and print their details\n  data['businesses'].each do |business|\n    puts \"Name: #{business['name']}\"\n    puts \"Address: #{business['location']['address1']}, #{business['location']['city']}, #{business['location']['state']} #{business['location']['zip_code']}\"\n    puts \"Phone: #{business['display_phone']}\"\n    puts \"Rating: #{business['rating']}\"\n    puts \"-\" * 30\n  end\nend\n\n# Call the method with the restaurant name you're looking for\nsearch_restaurants('restaurant_name')\n```\n\n### Steps to Follow:\n\n1. **API Key**: Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual Yelp API key. You can obtain this by creating an app on the [Yelp Developers website](https://www.yelp.com/developers).\n\n2. **Gems**: Ensure you have the `rest-client` and `json` gems installed. You can install them using:\n   ```sh\n   gem install rest-client\n   gem install json\n   ```\n\n3. **Running the Code**: Save this script to a `.rb` file and execute it using the Ruby interpreter. You can specify the restaurant name and location (default is New York) in the `search_restaurants` method call.\n\nThis script fetches restaurant data from Yelp and prints out details such as the name, address, phone number, and rating for each restaurant. Adjust the `limit` parameter in the `params` hash to control the number of results returned."
