Here are the grade weights:\n- Midterm Exam: 25%\n- Final Exam: 35%\n- Homework: 20%\n- Participation: 10%\n- Project: 10%\nAssume the grade data is stored in a SQL database with the following schema:\nTable name: grades\nColumns: student_id (integer), midterm_exam (float), final_exam (float), homework (float), participation (float), project (float)\nTo calculate the weighted average grade within a specific range, say between 80% and 90%, you can use this SQL query:\nSELECT (midterm_exam * 0.25 + final_exam * 0.35 + homework * 0.2 + participation * 0.1 + project * 0.1) AS weighted_average\nFROM grades\nWHERE (midterm_exam * 0.25 + final_exam * 0.35 + homework * 0.2 + participation * 0.1 + project * 0.1) BETWEEN 80 AND 90;"

        "content": "Your explanation and SQL query are on point. The query calculates the weighted average of grades for each student based on the given weights and filters the results to show only those students whose weighted average falls between 80% and 90%. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the query:\n\n1. **Weighted Average Calculation**:\n   - Each component of the grade (midterm, final, homework, etc.) is multiplied by its respective weight.\n   - The results are summed up to get the weighted average.\n\n2. **Filtering Condition**:\n   - The `WHERE` clause ensures that only the averages falling within the specified range (80 to 90) are selected.\n\nHere\u2019s the query again for clarity:\n\n```sql\nSELECT student_id, \n       (midterm_exam * 0.25 + \n        final_exam * 0.35 + \n        homework * 0.2 + \n        participation * 0.1 + \n        project * 0.1) AS weighted_average\nFROM grades\nWHERE (midterm_exam * 0.25 + \n       final_exam * 0.35 + \n       homework * 0.2 + \n       participation * 0.1 + \n       project * 0.1) BETWEEN 80 AND 90;\n```\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- **Select student_id**: Including `student_id` in the `SELECT` statement allows you to identify which students meet the criteria.\n- **Performance**: If you have a large dataset, consider creating an index on the calculated weighted average for faster querying.\n- **Edge Cases**: Ensure that the grades stored in the database are within valid ranges (typically 0 to 100) to avoid any unexpected results.\n\nThis query assumes that all grade components are mandatory and present for each student. If there might be `NULL` values, you may want to handle them using the `COALESCE` function to ensure correct calculations."
