        "content": "Certainly! Benchmarking a Python script typically involves measuring both execution time and memory usage. Here are several tools and methods you can use to achieve this on Linux:\n\n### Timing\n\n1. **`time` Command**: As you mentioned, the `time` command is a straightforward way to measure the execution time of a script from the command line. It provides real, user, and system times.\n\n2. **`timeit` Module**: For more detailed timing within Python, the `timeit` module is useful. It allows you to time small code snippets and is precise as it tries to minimize the overhead.\n\n   ```python\n   import timeit\n\n   # Example usage\n   execution_time = timeit.timeit('your_function()', setup='from __main__ import your_function', number=1000)\n   print(f\"Execution time: {execution_time} seconds\")\n   ```\n\n### Memory Usage\n\n1. **`memory_profiler`**: This is a Python module for monitoring memory usage. You can use it as a decorator to profile specific functions.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install memory_profiler\n   ```\n\n   ```python\n   from memory_profiler import profile\n\n   @profile\n   def your_function():\n       # Your code here\n\n   your_function()\n   ```\n\n   You can run the script to see line-by-line memory usage.\n\n2. **`psutil`**: This is a cross-platform library to retrieve information on running processes and system utilization (CPU, memory, disks, network, sensors) in Python.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install psutil\n   ```\n\n   ```python\n   import psutil\n   import os\n\n   process = psutil.Process(os.getpid())\n   print(f\"Memory usage: {process.memory_info().rss / 1024 ** 2} MB\")\n   ```\n\n### Profiling\n\n1. **`cProfile`**: Python's built-in profiler `cProfile` can be used to get more detailed information about where time is being spent in your program.\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m cProfile -s time your_script.py\n   ```\n\n   This will provide you with a detailed breakdown of the time spent in each function.\n\n### Combining Tools\n\nFor comprehensive benchmarking, you can combine these tools. Use `cProfile` for detailed timing information and `memory_profiler` for memory usage to get a full picture of your script's performance.\n\nBy using these tools, you can benchmark your Python scripts effectively across different data sizes to understand their performance characteristics."
