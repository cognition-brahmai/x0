In my code, when I execute `s = 'abacaba'` and `s.count('aba')`, I correctly get the output `2` since 'aba' occurs twice in the string `s`. However, when I execute `s = 'www'` followed by `s.count('ww')`, I expect to get the output `2` but instead it returns `1`. Why is this happening?"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing with the `count()` function in Python is due to how overlapping substrings are handled. When you use `s.count(substring)`, Python counts non-overlapping occurrences of the substring within the string `s`.\n\nLet's break down both examples:\n\n1. **`s = 'abacaba'` and `s.count('aba')`:**  \n   - The first occurrence of `'aba'` starts at index 0 (`'aba'`).\n   - The second occurrence of `'aba'` starts at index 4 (`'abacaba'`).\n   - These occurrences do not overlap, so Python can count both.\n\n2. **`s = 'www'` and `s.count('ww')`:**  \n   - The first occurrence of `'ww'` starts at index 0 (`'www'`).\n   - The next potential occurrence of `'ww'` would start at index 1, but that would overlap with the first occurrence.\n   - Python only counts non-overlapping occurrences, so only the first `'ww'` is counted.\n\nIn your expectation for `'www'`, you considered overlapping occurrences, but Python's `count()` function does not do that. It only counts non-overlapping substrings. If you need to count overlapping occurrences, you would need to implement a custom solution, such as iterating through the string and checking for overlaps manually."
