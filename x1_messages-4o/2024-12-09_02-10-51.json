I currently have a program that creates a file named 'sample.xml' and saves it to the directory. However, when I run the program again, the old file gets overwritten because they have the same filename. I'm considering making the code check the filename in the directory first and if the names match, generate a new filename. Here's the code I'm currently using:\n\n```\nfh = open(\"sample.xml\", \"w\")\nrs = [blockresult]\nfh.writelines(rs)\nfh.close()\n```"

        "content": "To avoid overwriting an existing file, you can implement a function that checks if a file with the given name already exists, and if so, creates a new filename by appending an incrementing number to the base name. Here's one way to do it using Python:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef get_incrementing_filename(base_name, extension):\n    i = 1\n    while True:\n        filename = f\"{base_name}{i}.{extension}\"\n        if not os.path.exists(filename):\n            return filename\n        i += 1\n\nbase_name = \"sample\"\nextension = \"xml\"\n\n# Get an incrementing filename\nfilename = get_incrementing_filename(base_name, extension)\n\n# Write to the new file\nwith open(filename, \"w\") as fh:\n    rs = [\"<your xml content here>\"]\n    fh.writelines(rs)\n\nprint(f\"File saved as: {filename}\")\n```\n\nHere's how this code works:\n\n1. The `get_incrementing_filename` function takes a `base_name` and an `extension` as input.\n2. It initializes a counter `i` starting at 1.\n3. It constructs a filename by appending the counter to the base name followed by the extension.\n4. It checks if the file with this name already exists using `os.path.exists()`.\n5. If the file does not exist, it returns this filename.\n6. If it does exist, it increments the counter and repeats the process until a unique filename is found.\n\nThis way, every time you run the program, it will create a new file with an incremented number, preventing overwriting the existing files."
