This function can check the access permissions for a specified path.\n\nHere is a code snippet that demonstrates how to check if a directory is writable:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef is_directory_writable(directory_path):\n    # Use os.access() to check for write permission\n    return os.access(directory_path, os.W_OK)\n\n# Example usage\ndirectory = '/path/to/directory'\nif is_directory_writable(directory):\n    print(f\"The directory '{directory}' is writable.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"The directory '{directory}' is not writable.\")\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- The `os.access()` function is used with the `os.W_OK` flag to check if the directory has write permission.\n- This function returns `True` if the directory is writable and `False` otherwise.\n\nKeep in mind that `os.access()` checks the real user ID and group ID of the process, so it accurately reflects the permissions of the user executing the script."
