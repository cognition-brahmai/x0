The code is correct and well-tested, but the formatting is not consistent. Is there an online platform where I can paste my Python code and get it correctly indented/formatted? Or is there a command I can use to overwrite each file with a properly formatted version, something like `X --input=*.py`?"

        "content": "To automatically format your Python code, you can use tools such as `Black` or `autopep8`. These tools can consistently format your code according to PEP 8 standards or any custom settings you might prefer.\n\n### Using Black:\n\n`Black` is an uncompromising code formatter for Python. It formats your code consistently and is widely used in the community.\n\n1. **Installation**: You can install Black using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install black\n   ```\n\n2. **Formatting Code**: You can format your Python files by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   black your_file.py\n   ```\n\n   To format all Python files in your current directory and its subdirectories, you can use:\n\n   ```bash\n   black .\n   ```\n\n   If you want to format all files with a specific pattern, you can use:\n\n   ```bash\n   black *.py\n   ```\n\n### Using autopep8:\n\n`autopep8` is another tool that automatically formats Python code to conform to the PEP 8 style guide.\n\n1. **Installation**: Install autopep8 using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install autopep8\n   ```\n\n2. **Formatting Code**: To format a specific file, run:\n\n   ```bash\n   autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive your_file.py\n   ```\n\n   For all files in a directory, you can use:\n\n   ```bash\n   autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive --recursive .\n   ```\n\n### Online Platforms:\n\nIf you prefer an online solution, there are platforms where you can paste your code and have it formatted, such as:\n\n- **Online Python Formatter**: Websites such as [Python Formatter](https://pythonformatter.com/) allow you to paste your code and get a formatted version online.\n\nThese tools should help you achieve consistent formatting across your Python codebase."
