        "content": "To find the maximum of the quadratic equation \\( y = 2x^2 - 5x - 4 \\) under the conditions provided, we need to evaluate the function at specific positive integer values of \\( x \\), which are multiples of 3 and greater than or equal to 6.\n\n**Step 1: Evaluate the function at specified \\( x \\) values:**\n\nGiven that \\( x \\) should be a multiple of 3 and \\( x \\geq 6 \\), the possible values for \\( x \\) are 6, 9, 12, and so on. Let's calculate the value of \\( y \\) for these values:\n\n1. \\( x = 6 \\)\n   \\[\n   y = 2(6)^2 - 5(6) - 4 = 72 - 30 - 4 = 38\n   \\]\n\n2. \\( x = 9 \\)\n   \\[\n   y = 2(9)^2 - 5(9) - 4 = 162 - 45 - 4 = 113\n   \\]\n\n3. \\( x = 12 \\)\n   \\[\n   y = 2(12)^2 - 5(12) - 4 = 288 - 60 - 4 = 224\n   \\]\n\nThe maximum value of \\( y \\) among these is 224 when \\( x = 12 \\).\n\n**Step 2: First derivative and critical points:**\n\nCalculate the first derivative of the function to find the critical points:\n\n\\[\ny' = \\frac{d}{dx}(2x^2 - 5x - 4) = 4x - 5\n\\]\n\nSetting the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:\n\n\\[\n4x - 5 = 0 \\\\\n4x = 5 \\\\\nx = \\frac{5}{4}\n\\]\n\nSince \\( x = \\frac{5}{4} \\) is not an integer, it doesn't apply to our constraints (multiples of 3 and integers). Therefore, we only evaluate integer points.\n\n**Step 3: Determine nature of maximum:**\n\nTo confirm if the maximum is local or global, consider that quadratic functions \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\) with \\( a > 0 \\) have a parabolic shape that opens upwards. Thus, they have a global minimum and no maximum over the real numbers. However, over a discrete set, like integers or specific conditions, we found the highest value at \\( x = 12 \\).\n\nGraphically, you would plot the function for integer multiples of 3 greater than or equal to 6, and observe that \\( y = 224 \\) at \\( x = 12 \\) is indeed the highest point within these conditions.\n\n**Real-life significance of finding maximum points:**\n\nIn real-life scenarios, finding the maximum point of a quadratic equation is crucial in optimization problems. For instance, businesses might use these calculations to maximize profit, minimize cost, or optimize resource allocation. In physics, it's applicable in determining the peak height of a projectile trajectory, maximizing the range, or optimizing energy use. Understanding these maximum points helps in making informed decisions to achieve desired outcomes efficiently.\n\n**Graphical Representation:**\n\nFor a graphical representation, plotting the function over the specified domain shows the discrete points and highlights the maximum value at \\( x = 12 \\).\n\nThis approach ensures practical understanding and application of quadratic functions in various fields."
