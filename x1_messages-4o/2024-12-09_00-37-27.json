        "content": "I'm using Flask-SQLAlchemy and I have a typical Post / Tags relationship, where many tags are associated with one post. I want to select posts which aren't tagged with any tag in a list that I provide. My models are set up like this:\n\n```python\nclass Post(db.Model):\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n    tags = db.relationship('Tag', lazy='dynamic')\n\nclass Tag(db.Model):\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n    name = db.Column(db.Text(50))\n    post_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('post.id'))\n```\n\nI tried to use the following query:\n\n```python\ndb.session.query(Post).filter(Post.tags.name.notin_(['dont','want','these']))\n```\n\nHowever, it fails with the following error:\n\n```python\nAttributeError: Neither 'InstrumentedAttribute' object nor 'Comparator' object associated with Post.tags has an attribute 'name'\n```\n\nI believe this is because 'tags' is a relationship and not a column. In a previous project, I achieved this by manually writing SQL like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM $posts WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT post_id FROM $tags WHERE name IN ('dont','want','these'))\n```\n\nHow can I achieve the same result using the SQLAlchemy API?"

        "content": "To achieve your desired result using the SQLAlchemy ORM, you need to adjust your query to properly handle the relationship between `Post` and `Tag`. Since `tags` is a relationship, you can't directly filter on it like a column. Instead, you can use a subquery to filter posts based on their tags. Here's how you can rewrite your query using SQLAlchemy's API:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import aliased\nfrom sqlalchemy import not_\n\n# Create an alias for the Tag model to use in the subquery\ntag_alias = aliased(Tag)\n\n# Subquery to find post IDs that have any of the undesired tags\nsubquery = (\n    db.session.query(tag_alias.post_id)\n    .filter(tag_alias.name.in_(['dont', 'want', 'these']))\n    .subquery()\n)\n\n# Main query to find posts not having any of the undesired tags\nposts = (\n    db.session.query(Post)\n    .filter(~Post.id.in_(subquery))\n    .all()\n)\n\n# The `~` operator is used to negate the condition in SQLAlchemy\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the query:\n\n1. **Alias**: Create an alias for the `Tag` model to use in the subquery. This avoids conflicts if you're using the `Tag` model elsewhere in your main query.\n\n2. **Subquery**: Construct a subquery that selects all `post_id`s from the `Tag` table where the tag name is in the list `['dont', 'want', 'these']`.\n\n3. **Main Query**: In the main query, filter `Post` entries where the `Post.id` is not in the results of the subquery. The `~` operator is used to negate the condition.\n\nBy using this approach, you should be able to filter posts that do not have any tags matching the undesired list, effectively achieving the same result as your manual SQL query."
