Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nx = ['w', 'e', 's', 's', 's', 'z', 'z', 's']\n\n# Initialize a counter to count occurrences of 's'\ncount = 0\n\n# Iterate through the list with both index and value\nfor index, value in enumerate(x):\n    if value == 's':\n        count += 1\n        # Check if it's the 4th occurrence\n        if count == 4:\n            print(f\"The index of the 4th occurrence of 's' is: {index}\")\n            break\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n\n```\nThe index of the 4th occurrence of 's' is: 7\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that you find the exact index of the 4th occurrence of 's'."
