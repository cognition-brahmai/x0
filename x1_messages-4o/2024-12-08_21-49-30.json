The input data is in an Excel table format, with one string per row. I also need to ignore whitespace and punctuation. Additionally, the program should have minimal processing time. Can you provide an example of Excel table code that can accomplish this task?"

        "content": "To efficiently extract palindromes from a large list of strings in Excel while preserving the original case format and handling special characters and emojis, you can use a combination of Excel functions and possibly some VBA for more complex operations. Here's a step-by-step guide using Excel formulas and a simple VBA script:\n\n### Using Excel Formulas\n\n1. **Add Helper Columns:**\n   - Suppose your strings are in Column A, starting from A2 downwards.\n\n2. **Normalize the String:**\n   - Add a helper column (e.g., Column B) to normalize the string by removing whitespace and punctuation. You can use a formula with nested `SUBSTITUTE` and `LOWER` functions to achieve this:\n     ```excel\n     =LOWER(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(A2, \" \", \"\"), \",\", \"\"), \".\", \"\"))\n     ```\n   - Extend this formula to handle other punctuation marks and special characters as needed.\n\n3. **Reverse the Normalized String:**\n   - Add another helper column (e.g., Column C) to reverse the normalized string using a custom VBA function (since Excel doesn\u2019t have a built-in reverse function).\n\n### VBA Code for Reversing a String\n\nTo reverse a string, you can create a simple VBA function:\n\n1. Press `ALT + F11` to open the VBA editor.\n2. Go to `Insert > Module` and paste the following code:\n\n   ```vba\n   Function ReverseString(s As String) As String\n       Dim i As Integer\n       Dim result As String\n       result = \"\"\n       For i = Len(s) To 1 Step -1\n           result = result & Mid(s, i, 1)\n       Next i\n       ReverseString = result\n   End Function\n   ```\n\n3. Close the VBA editor.\n\n4. In Column C, use the function to reverse the normalized string:\n   ```excel\n   =ReverseString(B2)\n   ```\n\n5. **Check for Palindromes:**\n   - In Column D, check if the normalized string (Column B) is equal to the reversed string (Column C):\n     ```excel\n     =IF(B2=C2, \"Palindrome\", \"Not Palindrome\")\n     ```\n\n6. **Filter Palindromes:**\n   - You can now filter Column D for \"Palindrome\" to get the rows with palindromes while preserving the original case and special characters in Column A.\n\n### Example Excel Table\n\n| Original String (A) | Normalized (B)  | Reversed (C) | Result (D)       |\n|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|------------------|\n| Madam               | madam           | madam        | Palindrome       |\n| Hello               | hello           | olleh        | Not Palindrome   |\n| A man, a plan, a canal, Panama | amanaplanacanalpanama | amanaplanacanalpanama | Palindrome |\n\nThis approach will handle normalization and palindrome checking efficiently for a large dataset while preserving the original format in Excel. Note that processing time will depend on the size of your dataset and the complexity of the string manipulations, but using helper columns and VBA functions can help optimize performance."
