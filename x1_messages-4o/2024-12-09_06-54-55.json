I wrote a simple test program using threading.Timer() to understand how it works. The program ran correctly without any issues. But, when I tried to modify the 'hello' function to include a parameter, I encountered an error. Can anyone help me understand what the problem is and how to solve it? Here are my test programs:\n\nThis is the original test program:\n\n```python\nimport threading\n\ndef hello():\n    print \"hello, world\"\n\nt = threading.Timer(10.0, hello)\nt.start() \nprint \"Hi\"\ni=10\ni=i+20\nprint i\n```\n\nThis is the modified test program that's giving me an error:\n\n```python\nimport threading\n\ndef hello(s):\n    print s\n\nh=\"hello world\"\nt = threading.Timer(10.0, hello(h))\nt.start() \nprint \"Hi\"\ni=10\ni=i+20\nprint i\n```\n\nHere's the error I'm getting:\n\n```python\nhello world\nHi\n30\nException in thread Thread-1:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/threading.py\", line 522, in __bootstrap_inner\n    self.run()\n  File \"/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/threading.py\", line 726, in run\n    self.function(*self.args, **self.kwargs)\nTypeError: 'NoneType' object is not callable\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the way you're passing the `hello` function to the `threading.Timer`. When you call `hello(h)` within the `Timer` constructor, you're actually invoking the `hello` function immediately and passing its return value (which is `None`) to the `Timer`, instead of passing the function itself to be called later.\n\nTo fix this, you need to pass the `hello` function itself to the `Timer` and specify the arguments separately using the `args` parameter. Here's how you can modify your test program to work correctly:\n\n```python\nimport threading\n\ndef hello(s):\n    print(s)\n\nh = \"hello world\"\nt = threading.Timer(10.0, hello, args=(h,))\nt.start() \nprint(\"Hi\")\ni = 10\ni = i + 20\nprint(i)\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, `hello` is passed as the function to be called, and `args=(h,)` specifies that the argument `h` should be passed to `hello` when it's executed by the `Timer`. This way, the `hello` function is not called immediately, and the `Timer` can invoke it correctly after the specified delay."
