        "content": "To add a custom search box in the Django admin panel that allows you to search for images by their 'ID', you can make use of the `search_fields` attribute in your `PhotoAdmin` class. To search by the 'ID', which seems to be represented by the `image_id` field in your model, you can add it to the `search_fields` list. \n\nHere's how you can modify your `PhotoAdmin` class in `admin.py` to include the `search_fields`:\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom photo.models import Photo\n\nclass PhotoAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    list_display = ('name', 'approved', 'approved_time', 'uploaded_time', 'user')\n    search_fields = ('image_id',)  # Add 'image_id' to enable search functionality\n\nadmin.site.register(Photo, PhotoAdmin)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what this does:\n\n- `list_display`: This remains as is, showing the fields you want to display in the admin list view.\n- `search_fields`: This is a list of fields you want to enable searching on. By adding `image_id` to it, you're allowing the admin to search for photos by their ID.\n\nOnce you have made these changes, you should see a search box in the admin interface for the `Photo` model, allowing you to search by the `image_id`. \n\nMake sure you restart your Django server to apply the changes. This will enable the search functionality based on the `image_id` field in your admin panel."
