I attempted to get the sum of the column using `groupby` and `.sum()` like this:\n```\nTotal = df.groupby['MyColumn'].sum()\n\nprint Total\n```\nBut, it's throwing an error: `TypeError: 'instancemethod' object has no attribute '__getitem__'`.\nHow can I get the total of 'MyColumn'? I would expect the output to be `319`. Alternatively, I would also like to know how to add a new row entitled 'TOTAL' containing the total to the dataframe 'df'."

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to a syntax mistake when attempting to use `groupby`. However, if you're simply looking to sum up a single column, you don't need to use `groupby`. You can directly use the `.sum()` method on the column itself.\n\nHere's how you can get the total of the 'MyColumn':\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming df is your DataFrame\ntotal_my_column = df['MyColumn'].sum()\n\nprint(\"Total of MyColumn:\", total_my_column)\n```\n\nThis will give you the expected output of `319`.\n\nIf you want to add a new row entitled 'TOTAL' containing the total to the dataframe, you can do the following:\n\n```python\n# Create a new DataFrame with the 'TOTAL' row\ntotal_row = pd.DataFrame({'X': ['TOTAL'], 'MyColumn': [total_my_column], 'Y': [None], 'Z': [None]})\n\n# Append the new row to the original DataFrame\ndf_with_total = pd.concat([df, total_row], ignore_index=True)\n\nprint(df_with_total)\n```\n\nThis will add a new row at the bottom of the DataFrame with 'TOTAL' in the 'X' column and the sum of 'MyColumn' in the 'MyColumn' column, while leaving 'Y' and 'Z' as `None`."
