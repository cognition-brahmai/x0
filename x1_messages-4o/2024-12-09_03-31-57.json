The error message is: \n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"env\\lib\\site-packages\\django\\test\\testcases.py\", line 962, in tearDownClass\ncls._rollback_atomics(cls.cls_atomics)\n  AttributeError: type object 'SomeTests' has no attribute 'cls_atomics'\n```\n\nI am able to debug through the test and step through all lines without problems, but the exception is thrown after the last line. Here is an example of one of the tests:\n\n``` \nimport django\nimport unittest\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nimport logging\nimport sys\nfrom builtins import classmethod, isinstance\n\nclass ATestTests(TestCase):\n\n    @classmethod\n    def setUpClass(cls):\n        django.setup()\n        logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stderr, level=logging.DEBUG)\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        self._app = Application(name=\"a\")\n\n    def testtest(self):\n        self.assertIsNotNone(self._app)\n```\n\nThe packages in my environment include Django 1.8, django-extensions 1.5.2, django-filter 0.9.2 and others. How can I fix this AttributeError?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to the way Django 1.8 handles database transactions and test cases. In Django 1.8, the `TestCase` class uses database atomic blocks to ensure tests have a clean database state. The `cls_atomics` attribute is expected to be set up during the test lifecycle, but it seems to be missing in your test class.\n\nHere's how you can address this issue:\n\n1. **Remove `django.setup()` from `setUpClass`:** In Django projects, `django.setup()` is typically called once when the application starts, and it should not be re-invoked in test classes. Since you are using `TestCase`, Django already takes care of setting up the environment for you. You can safely remove this line from your `setUpClass` method.\n\n2. **Ensure proper superclass calls:** If you're overriding `setUpClass` or `tearDownClass`, make sure to call the superclass methods using `super()`. However, in this case, since `django.setup()` is not needed, you might not need to override `setUpClass` at all.\n\n3. **Remove unnecessary imports:** You have some redundant imports like `unittest`, `isinstance`, and `classmethod` from `builtins`. They aren't needed for the code you provided and can be removed to clean up your code.\n\n4. **Example of a simplified test class:**\n\n   ```python\n   import logging\n   import sys\n   from django.test import TestCase\n   from your_app.models import Application  # Make sure to import your Application model\n\n   class ATestTests(TestCase):\n       def setUp(self):\n           logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stderr, level=logging.DEBUG)\n           self._app = Application(name=\"a\")\n\n       def testtest(self):\n           self.assertIsNotNone(self._app)\n   ```\n\n5. **Check the Application model import:** Make sure you have imported the `Application` model correctly from your app.\n\n6. **Re-run your tests:** After making these changes, try running your tests again. Ensure your test database is correctly set up and that you have no pending migrations.\n\nBy removing `django.setup()` and ensuring your test class does not interfere with Django's test lifecycle, you should resolve the `AttributeError`."
