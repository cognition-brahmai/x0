        "content": "In Parallel Python, a callback is a feature that allows you to specify a function that will be called automatically once a submitted task is completed. This can be particularly useful for handling the results of asynchronous computations without having to constantly check if the task is finished.\n\nWhen you use the `submit` function in Parallel Python to execute a task, you can provide a callback function as one of the arguments. This callback function will be invoked with the result of the task as its argument once the task has finished executing.\n\nHere is a basic outline of how you might use a callback in Parallel Python:\n\n1. **Define the Callback Function**: Create a function that will process the result of the task. This function should accept one parameter, which will be the result of the computation.\n\n   ```python\n   def my_callback(result):\n       print(\"Task completed with result:\", result)\n   ```\n\n2. **Submit a Task with the Callback**: When submitting a task using the `submit` function, pass the callback function as an argument.\n\n   ```python\n   from pp import Server\n\n   def my_task(x, y):\n       return x + y\n\n   ppserver = Server()\n   job = ppserver.submit(my_task, (5, 10), callback=my_callback)\n   ```\n\nIn this example, once `my_task` has been completed, Parallel Python will automatically call `my_callback` with the result of `my_task`. This allows you to handle the result immediately without blocking or polling for completion.\n\nThe primary advantage of using a callback is that it allows your program to remain responsive and efficiently manage multiple asynchronous tasks. This is especially useful in scenarios where you might be dealing with numerous parallel computations and want to handle their results as soon as they become available."
