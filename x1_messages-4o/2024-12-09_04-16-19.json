Currently, I am able to substitute 'a' with 'aa' in a text file using the following code:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nwith open(\"notes.txt\") as text:\n    new_text = re.sub(\"a\", \"aa\", text.read())\n    with open(\"notes2.txt\", \"w\") as result:\n        result.write(new_text)\n```\n\nBut I am unsure how to implement multiple substitutions, for example, replacing 'a' with 'aa', 'b' with 'bb', and 'c' with 'cc'. Do I have to repeat the line `new_text = re.sub(\"a\", \"aa\", text.read())` for each letter I want to replace, or is there a more efficient way to do this, possibly by using a dictionary or an array?"

        "content": "You can perform multiple substitutions efficiently by using a dictionary to map each character you want to replace with its replacement. Then, you can use a function in `re.sub` to perform these replacements. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Define a dictionary for the substitutions\nsubstitutions = {\n    'a': 'aa',\n    'b': 'bb',\n    'c': 'cc',\n}\n\n# Function to perform the substitution\ndef replace(match):\n    return substitutions[match.group(0)]\n\n# Read the file, perform substitutions, and write the result\nwith open(\"notes.txt\") as text:\n    content = text.read()\n    # Create a regex pattern that matches any of the keys in the dictionary\n    pattern = re.compile(\"|\".join(re.escape(key) for key in substitutions.keys()))\n    # Perform the substitutions using the function\n    new_text = pattern.sub(replace, content)\n    \n    with open(\"notes2.txt\", \"w\") as result:\n        result.write(new_text)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Dictionary of Substitutions**: You define a dictionary `substitutions` where the keys are the characters you want to replace, and the values are the corresponding replacements.\n\n2. **Replacement Function**: The `replace` function takes a match object as input and returns the replacement string using the `substitutions` dictionary.\n\n3. **Regex Pattern**: You create a regex pattern that matches any of the keys in the `substitutions` dictionary. The `re.escape` function ensures that any special characters in the keys are treated as literal characters.\n\n4. **Substitution**: The `pattern.sub(replace, content)` performs the substitutions by calling the `replace` function for each match found in the content.\n\nThis method is efficient and scalable, as you can easily add more substitutions to the dictionary without changing the rest of the code."
