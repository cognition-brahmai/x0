I have a \"date\" field in my Rating model as follows: `date = models.DateTimeField(editable=True, auto_now_add=True)`. However, it doesn't show in the admin system, even though I have set `editable` to `True`. My `admin.py` file is set up like this:\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom glasses.players.models import *\nadmin.site.register(Rating)\n```\n\nDoes anyone know why this is happening?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is likely related to the use of the `auto_now_add` attribute in your `DateTimeField`. In Django, when you set `auto_now_add=True` on a DateTimeField, it automatically sets the field to the current date and time when the object is first created. However, fields with `auto_now_add=True` are not editable in the admin interface, regardless of the `editable` attribute setting, because Django treats them as automatically managed fields.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you have a couple of options depending on your requirements:\n\n### Option 1: Remove `auto_now_add` and Manually Handle the Date\n\nIf you want the date field to be editable through the admin interface, you should remove the `auto_now_add=True` attribute and handle the date manually, either within your code or by allowing users to set it in the admin interface:\n\n```python\ndate = models.DateTimeField(editable=True)\n```\n\nYou can set the date manually when creating a `Rating` instance, like so:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\nrating = Rating(date=datetime.now())\n```\n\n### Option 2: Use `auto_now_add` but Display it in the Admin\n\nIf you don't need to edit the date but still want it visible in the admin interface, you can customize the admin display. You can create a custom admin class to explicitly list which fields should be displayed:\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom glasses.players.models import Rating\n\nclass RatingAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    list_display = ('id', 'date', 'other_field1', 'other_field2')  # Include other fields you want to display\n\nadmin.site.register(Rating, RatingAdmin)\n```\n\nThis way, the `date` field will appear in the list display of the admin while still being automatically set upon creation.\n\nChoose the option that best fits your use case. If you want the date to be editable and set by the user, go with the first option. If you want it automatically set but visible, opt for the second approach."
