        "content": "I am using pandas to read a CSV file and filter the columns with `usecols`. However, I am facing an issue when using multiple indexes. I expect that two DataFrames, df1 and df2, should be the same except for the missing dummy column. However, the columns are mislabeled and the date is getting parsed as a date. Using column numbers instead of names also gives me the same problem. I am able to work around the issue by dropping the dummy column after the `read_csv` step, but I want to understand what is going wrong. I am using pandas 0.10.1. Here is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\ncsv = r\"\"\"dummy,date,loc,x\n   bar,20090101,a,1\n   bar,20090102,a,3\n   bar,20090103,a,5\n   bar,20090101,b,1\n   bar,20090102,b,3\n   bar,20090103,b,5\"\"\"\n\nf = open('foo.csv', 'w')\nf.write(csv)\nf.close()\n\ndf1 = pd.read_csv('foo.csv',\n        header=0,\n        names=[\"dummy\", \"date\", \"loc\", \"x\"], \n        index_col=[\"date\", \"loc\"], \n        usecols=[\"dummy\", \"date\", \"loc\", \"x\"],\n        parse_dates=[\"date\"])\nprint df1\n\ndf2 = pd.read_csv('foo.csv', \n        index_col=[\"date\", \"loc\"], \n        usecols=[\"date\", \"loc\", \"x\"], \n        parse_dates=[\"date\"],\n        header=0,\n        names=[\"dummy\", \"date\", \"loc\", \"x\"])\nprint df2\n```\n\nThe output I get is:\n\n```python\nIn [118]: %run test.py\n               dummy  x\ndate       loc\n2009-01-01 a     bar  1\n2009-01-02 a     bar  3\n2009-01-03 a     bar  5\n2009-01-01 b     bar  1\n2009-01-02 b     bar  3\n2009-01-03 b     bar  5\n              date\ndate loc\na    1    20090101\n     3    20090102\n     5    20090103\nb    1    20090101\n     3    20090102\n     5    20090103\n```"

        "content": "The issue arises from how the `usecols` and `names` parameters are being used in combination with `read_csv`. Let's break down the behavior:\n\n1. **Parameter Usage**:\n   - `usecols`: Specifies which columns to read. If you provide names here, it selects based on those names.\n   - `names`: Provides new names for columns after reading the file. This does not filter columns; it just renames them.\n   - `index_col`: Specifies which columns to use as the index. \n\n2. **Behavior in Your Code**:\n   - In `df1`, you specify `usecols=[\"dummy\", \"date\", \"loc\", \"x\"]`, which includes all columns from the CSV. You then use `names` to rename the columns after reading them. Since you're using all columns, everything is read as expected.\n   - In `df2`, you specify `usecols=[\"date\", \"loc\", \"x\"]`, which excludes the `dummy` column. However, you're using `names=[\"dummy\", \"date\", \"loc\", \"x\"]` which is expecting to rename four columns, leading to a mismatch because only three columns are actually being read.\n\n3. **Understanding the Mismatch**:\n   - When you exclude `dummy` using `usecols` in `df2`, the `names` parameter is still expecting a column for `dummy`, causing a misalignment. This is why `date` ends up as a column itself, rather than being part of the index, and the data gets misinterpreted.\n\n4. **Solution**:\n   - Ensure that `names` corresponds exactly to the columns being read by `usecols`. If you're reading fewer columns, adjust `names` accordingly.\n   - Alternatively, if you want to rename columns after reading, use a separate step to rename them rather than doing it within `read_csv`.\n\nHere's how you can adjust your code for `df2`:\n\n```python\ndf2 = pd.read_csv('foo.csv', \n        index_col=[\"date\", \"loc\"], \n        usecols=[\"date\", \"loc\", \"x\"], \n        parse_dates=[\"date\"],\n        header=0)\n\n# Rename columns after reading\ndf2.columns = [\"x\"]\nprint(df2)\n```\n\nThis approach reads the correct columns and sets the appropriate index, ensuring `x` is correctly labeled."
