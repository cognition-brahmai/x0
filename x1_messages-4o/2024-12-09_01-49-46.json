        "content": "The issue you're encountering occurs because, starting from TensorFlow 2.x, the `ConfigProto` function is not directly accessible in the manner you are trying to use it. TensorFlow 2.x has a different execution model and API changes compared to TensorFlow 1.x.\n\nSince you mentioned that you're using TensorFlow 1.13.1, you should be able to access `ConfigProto` directly. However, if you're using TensorFlow 2.x or if there's a version mismatch, you'll need to adjust your code accordingly.\n\nHere's how you can ensure that you're using the correct version and syntax:\n\n1. **Check TensorFlow Version**:\n   Make sure you are indeed using TensorFlow 1.13.1. You can check the version by running:\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n   print(tf.__version__)\n   ```\n\n2. **Using ConfigProto with TensorFlow 1.x**:\n   If you are using TensorFlow 1.13.1, your code should work. Here's how you can use it:\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n\n   config = tf.ConfigProto(\n       intra_op_parallelism_threads=8,\n       inter_op_parallelism_threads=8,\n       allow_soft_placement=True,\n       device_count={'CPU': 1, 'GPU': 1}\n   )\n\n   # Use the config when creating a session\n   with tf.Session(config=config) as sess:\n       # Your code here\n       pass\n   ```\n\n3. **Migrating to TensorFlow 2.x**:\n   If you are using TensorFlow 2.x and want to stick with it, note that session-based execution is not the default mode in TensorFlow 2.x. You may need to disable eager execution to use session-based execution, or preferably, adapt your code to the new paradigm.\n\n   To disable eager execution and use `ConfigProto` in TensorFlow 2.x:\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf\n   tf.disable_v2_behavior()\n\n   config = tf.ConfigProto(\n       intra_op_parallelism_threads=8,\n       inter_op_parallelism_threads=8,\n       allow_soft_placement=True,\n       device_count={'CPU': 1, 'GPU': 1}\n   )\n\n   with tf.Session(config=config) as sess:\n       # Your code here\n       pass\n   ```\n\nIf you want to use TensorFlow 2.x features, consider adopting the new model-building approach, such as using the Keras API, which is more intuitive and compatible with eager execution."
