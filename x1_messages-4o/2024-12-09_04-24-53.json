Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport urllib2\n\n# Specify the URL you want to access\nurl = 'http://example.com'\n\n# Create a request object and set the desired user agent\nrequest = urllib2.Request(url)\nrequest.add_header('User-Agent', 'Your Desired User Agent')\n\n# Open the URL with the modified request\nresponse = urllib2.urlopen(request)\n\n# Read and print the response if needed\nweb_content = response.read()\nprint(web_content)\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, replace `'Your Desired User Agent'` with the user agent string you wish to use. This will alter the default user agent and allow you to download the webpage with the specified user agent."
