        "content": "The error you are encountering suggests that the installation of `pandas` might not have been successful due to an underlying issue with the `numpy` package, which `pandas` depends on. Here are some steps you can follow to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify Python Version Compatibility**: \n   - You're using Python 2.7, which is quite outdated. If possible, consider upgrading to Python 3.x, as many libraries, including `pandas`, are optimized for Python 3. This might also resolve compatibility issues.\n   \n2. **Upgrade `pip`**:\n   - Before proceeding with the installation, ensure that `pip` is up-to-date. Run the following command:\n     ```\n     python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n     ```\n\n3. **Install/Upgrade `setuptools` and `wheel`**:\n   - These packages can assist in building and installing packages. Run:\n     ```\n     pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel\n     ```\n\n4. **Install `numpy` First**:\n   - Since `pandas` depends on `numpy`, try installing `numpy` separately:\n     ```\n     pip install numpy\n     ```\n\n5. **Reinstall `pandas`**:\n   - After successfully installing `numpy`, try reinstalling `pandas`:\n     ```\n     pip install pandas\n     ```\n\n6. **Check Environment**:\n   - Ensure that you're installing the packages in the correct environment. If you have multiple Python installations, you might be installing `pandas` for a different version. Verify by running the following commands to check the path:\n     ```\n     python -c \"import sys; print(sys.executable)\"\n     pip -V\n     ```\n\n7. **Use a Virtual Environment**:\n   - If the issue persists, try using a virtual environment to manage your dependencies. This helps isolate your project environment from other projects:\n     ```\n     pip install virtualenv\n     virtualenv myprojectenv\n     myprojectenv\\Scripts\\activate  # On Windows\n     # source myprojectenv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux\n     pip install pandas\n     ```\n\n8. **Alternative Installation Methods**:\n   - If `pip` installation continues to fail, consider using a precompiled binary or a package manager like `conda` (if you're open to using Anaconda):\n     ```\n     conda install pandas\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the ImportError and successfully use `pandas` in your project. If you upgrade to Python 3, make sure to adjust your script accordingly for compatibility."
