Currently, when I execute the script using the following code, it starts printing output because run.sh has print commands in it. I want to be able to not only print the output but also redirect it to a text file. Here is my current code:\n```python\nsubprocess.call([\"/home/myuser/run.sh\", \"/tmp/ad_xml\",  \"/tmp/video_xml\"])\n```"

        "content": "To redirect the output of a subprocess call to a text file while still being able to print it in the console, you can use the `subprocess` module in Python and specifically the `subprocess.run` method with `stdout` and `stderr` parameters. You can also use `tee` to achieve simultaneous output to the console and a file. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\n# Define the command to run\ncommand = [\"/home/myuser/run.sh\", \"/tmp/ad_xml\", \"/tmp/video_xml\"]\n\n# Open the output file\nwith open('output.txt', 'w') as f:\n    # Run the command with subprocess.run\n    process = subprocess.run(command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)\n    \n    # Write the output to the file\n    f.write(process.stdout)\n    f.write(process.stderr)\n    \n    # Print the output to the console\n    print(process.stdout)\n    print(process.stderr)\n```\n\nThis code will capture both `stdout` and `stderr` from the subprocess call and write them to a file named `output.txt`, while also printing them to the console.\n\nAlternatively, if you want to use `tee` to achieve the same in a more Unix-like fashion, you can modify your script as follows:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\n# Define the command to run with tee\ncommand = \"bash -c '/home/myuser/run.sh /tmp/ad_xml /tmp/video_xml | tee output.txt'\"\n\n# Run the command\nsubprocess.call(command, shell=True)\n```\n\nHere, `tee` is used to send the output to both the console and the `output.txt` file. Note that `shell=True` is used because we are passing a single string command that includes shell-specific syntax."
