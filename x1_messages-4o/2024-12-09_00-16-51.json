        "content": "I am working with a Python script that includes a bulk insert to a MS SQL Server using pyodbc. The script I am using involves a loop over 1,300,000 rows which causes the insert of about 300,000 rows to take around 40 minutes. I am looking for a way to speed up this process. Is the slow performance due to the iteration over rows using `for data in reader:`? I have included my current script below for reference. I am intentionally dynamically picking my column headers for the sake of making the code as pythonic as possible. The table name in the SQL Server is SpikeData123.\n\n```python\n# Opens the prepped csv file\nwith open (os.path.join(newpath,outfile), 'r') as f:\n    # hooks csv reader to file\n    reader = csv.reader(f)\n    # pulls out the columns (which match the SQL table)\n    columns = next(reader)\n    # trims any extra spaces\n    columns = [x.strip(' ') for x in columns]\n    # starts SQL statement\n    query = 'bulk insert into SpikeData123({0}) values ({1})'\n    # puts column names in SQL query 'query'\n    query = query.format(','.join(columns), ','.join('?' * len(columns)))\n\n    print 'Query is: %s' % query\n    # starts curser from cnxn (which works)\n    cursor = cnxn.cursor()\n    # uploads everything by row\n    for data in reader:\n        cursor.execute(query, data)\n        cursor.commit()\n```"

        "content": "The slow performance in your script could be attributed to how the data is being inserted into the SQL Server. There are a few potential areas for improvement:\n\n1. **Batch Insertion**: Instead of inserting each row one by one, you can insert data in batches. This reduces the number of round trips between your script and the SQL Server, which can significantly speed up the process.\n\n2. **Using SQL Server's BULK INSERT**: Instead of using `pyodbc` to insert rows one at a time, you can use SQL Server's native `BULK INSERT` command if you have access to the server's file system. This method is generally faster as it is optimized for large data loads.\n\n3. **Using `executemany`**: The `pyodbc` library supports `executemany`, which allows you to insert multiple rows in a single operation.\n\nHere's a revised version of your script that uses `executemany` for batch insertion:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport csv\nimport pyodbc\n\ndef bulk_insert_to_sql(file_path, table_name, cnxn, batch_size=1000):\n    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:\n        reader = csv.reader(f)\n        columns = next(reader)\n        columns = [x.strip(' ') for x in columns]\n\n        query = f'INSERT INTO {table_name} ({\",\".join(columns)}) VALUES ({\",\".join(\"?\" * len(columns))})'\n\n        cursor = cnxn.cursor()\n\n        data_batch = []\n        for data in reader:\n            data_batch.append(data)\n            if len(data_batch) == batch_size:\n                cursor.executemany(query, data_batch)\n                cnxn.commit()\n                data_batch = []\n\n        # Insert remaining data\n        if data_batch:\n            cursor.executemany(query, data_batch)\n            cnxn.commit()\n\n        cursor.close()\n\n# Example usage\nfile_path = os.path.join(newpath, outfile)\ntable_name = 'SpikeData123'\nbulk_insert_to_sql(file_path, table_name, cnxn)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Batch Size**: A batch size of 1000 is used to insert 1000 rows at a time. You can experiment with this value to find the optimal batch size for your setup.\n- **Commit After Each Batch**: The `commit()` is called after each batch is inserted to make the operation permanent.\n- **Native `BULK INSERT`**: If the CSV file is accessible by the SQL Server, you can use SQL Server's `BULK INSERT` command directly from a SQL query executed by `pyodbc` for potentially even faster performance.\n\nBy using these techniques, you should see a noticeable improvement in the time it takes to insert your data."
