This involves focusing your attention on the present moment and acknowledging your thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations without judgment. You can do this through deep breathing exercises, meditation, or simply by taking a mindful walk. Staying present helps reduce stress, enhances self-awareness, and promotes emotional well-being. Remember, it's okay to take small breaks throughout your day to just breathe and be aware of the here and now."
