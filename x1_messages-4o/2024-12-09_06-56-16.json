        "content": "The error message \"ImportError: No Module Named bs4\" indicates that the BeautifulSoup4 module, which provides the `bs4` package, is not installed in your virtual environment. When you activate a virtual environment, it creates an isolated environment for your project where you need to install all the necessary packages separately, even if they're already installed globally on your system.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to install BeautifulSoup4 within your virtual environment. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Activate your virtual environment**: Make sure your virtual environment is activated. You can activate it by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n   - On Windows:\n     ```bash\n     .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate\n     ```\n\n   - On macOS/Linux:\n     ```bash\n     source venv/bin/activate\n     ```\n\n2. **Install BeautifulSoup4**: Once your virtual environment is activated, you can install BeautifulSoup4 using pip. Run the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install beautifulsoup4\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify the installation**: After installing, you can verify the installation by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip show beautifulsoup4\n   ```\n\n   This command will display information about the BeautifulSoup4 package if it is installed correctly.\n\n4. **Run your Flask application**: Now, try running your Flask application again. The error should be resolved.\n\nIf you have a `requirements.txt` file for your project, you can add `beautifulsoup4` to it by running:\n\n```bash\npip freeze > requirements.txt\n```\n\nThis ensures that anyone else working on the project can install the necessary packages by running:\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nThese steps should help you resolve the import error and get your Flask project running smoothly within your virtual environment."
