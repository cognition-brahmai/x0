        "content": "To accomplish this task, you can create a C++ function that performs the following steps:\n\n1. Accept an integer `n` as input.\n2. Generate a random number between 1 and 10 and add it to `n`.\n3. Select a random joke from the provided array.\n4. Check if the modified `n` exceeds the length of the selected joke. If it does, handle it appropriately (e.g., use modulo operation to wrap around).\n5. Return the `n`th character of the selected joke.\n\nHere's a C++ function that implements these steps:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cstdlib>\n#include <ctime>\n\nconst char* catJokes[] = {\n  \"Why don't cats play poker in the jungle? Too many cheetahs.\",\n  \"Why did the cat join Instagram? To stalk meow celebrities.\",\n  \"What do you call a cat who likes to eat beans? A purrito.\",\n  \"Why do cats make terrible storytellers? They only have one tail.\",\n  \"What do you call a cat that loves to bowl? An alley cat.\",\n  \"Why don't cats like online shopping? They prefer a cat-alog.\"\n};\n\nchar getNthCharacter(int n) {\n    // Seed the random number generator\n    std::srand(std::time(nullptr));\n\n    // Add a random number between 1 and 10 to n\n    n += (std::rand() % 10) + 1;\n\n    // Select a random joke\n    int jokeIndex = std::rand() % (sizeof(catJokes) / sizeof(catJokes[0]));\n    const char* selectedJoke = catJokes[jokeIndex];\n\n    // Handle case where n exceeds the length of the joke\n    int jokeLength = std::strlen(selectedJoke);\n    if (n >= jokeLength) {\n        n = n % jokeLength; // Wrap around using modulo\n    }\n\n    // Return the nth character\n    return selectedJoke[n];\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    std::cout << \"Enter an integer: \";\n    std::cin >> n;\n\n    char result = getNthCharacter(n);\n    std::cout << \"The character is: \" << result << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Random Number Generation:** We use `std::rand()` to generate a random number. `std::srand(std::time(nullptr))` seeds the random number generator to ensure different results each time the program runs.\n- **Random Joke Selection:** We randomly select an index for the `catJokes` array to choose a joke.\n- **Index Handling:** If `n` exceeds the length of the joke, we use the modulo operation to wrap around, ensuring we always get a valid index.\n- **Character Retrieval:** Finally, we return the character at the modified index `n` from the selected joke.\n\nThis function should handle the requirements you've outlined efficiently."
