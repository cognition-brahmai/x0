My current code is as follows:\n\n```python\ndata=[]\nwebsites=['http://google.com', 'http://bbc.co.uk']\nfor w in websites:\n    r= requests.get(w, verify=False)\n    data.append( (r.url, len(r.content), r.elapsed.total_seconds(), str([(l.status_code, l.url) for l in r.history]), str(r.headers.items()), str(r.cookies.items())) )\n```\n\nHowever, I want the `requests.get` to timeout after 10 seconds so the loop doesn't get stuck. I've looked at previous solutions but none of them seem clean. I've also heard that not using requests might be a good idea, but I'm unsure of how to gather the same information without it. How can I implement this timeout feature into my current code?"

        "content": "You can easily implement a timeout feature in your existing code by using the `timeout` parameter available in the `requests.get` function. This parameter allows you to specify the maximum time (in seconds) that the request should take before it's considered a failure. Here's how you can modify your code to include a 10-second timeout:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndata = []\nwebsites = ['http://google.com', 'http://bbc.co.uk']\nfor w in websites:\n    try:\n        r = requests.get(w, verify=False, timeout=10)  # Set timeout to 10 seconds\n        data.append((\n            r.url,\n            len(r.content),\n            r.elapsed.total_seconds(),\n            str([(l.status_code, l.url) for l in r.history]),\n            str(r.headers.items()),\n            str(r.cookies.items())\n        ))\n    except requests.exceptions.Timeout:\n        print(f\"Request to {w} timed out.\")\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n# Output the collected data\nfor entry in data:\n    print(entry)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`timeout=10`**: This sets the timeout for the request to 10 seconds. If the server does not respond within this time, a `requests.exceptions.Timeout` exception is raised.\n- **`try-except` block**: It's a good practice to handle potential exceptions that can occur during HTTP requests, like timeouts or connection errors. This ensures that your program doesn't crash and you can handle errors gracefully.\n- **`requests.exceptions.Timeout`**: Specifically catches the timeout exception, so you know if a request took too long.\n- **`requests.exceptions.RequestException`**: Catches any other exceptions related to the request.\n\nThis approach keeps your code clean and allows you to handle cases where the server might be slow or unresponsive without affecting the rest of your data gathering process."
