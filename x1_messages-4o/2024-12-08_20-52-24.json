        "content": "To arrange the verbs in order of increasing intensity of movement, consider the energy and effort involved in each action:\n\n1. Step - This involves the least intensity, as it is simply the act of placing one foot in front of the other in a normal walking manner.\n2. Stride - This is more intense than a step, as it involves taking long, decisive steps, often indicating purpose or speed.\n3. Lunge - This involves the greatest intensity, as it requires a sudden forward movement, often with a bent knee, indicating a greater level of effort and energy.\n\nSo, the order is: step, stride, lunge."
