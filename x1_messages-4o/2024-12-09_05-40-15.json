However, I'm getting different results when comparing the results of numpy (CPU) and gnumpy (GPU). I have a test script which shows the problem, and the differences are around the magnitude of 10^-5. Should I be worried about these differences or is this the expected behaviour? The GPU I'm using is a GeForce GTX 770 and the numpy version is 1.6.1. I noticed the problem when I used gradient checking (with finite difference approximation) to verify that the small modifications I made to switch from numpy to gnumpy didn't break anything. The errors differed between CPU and GPU when using the same precision. What could be the reason for this?"

        "content": "Differences in results between CPU and GPU computations are common and generally expected due to several reasons related to how floating-point arithmetic is handled on different platforms. Here are some of the key reasons for the discrepancies you're observing:\n\n1. **Floating-point Precision**: \n   - Differences in floating-point precision between CPU and GPU calculations can lead to small discrepancies in results. GPUs often use single-precision (32-bit) floating-point arithmetic by default, while CPUs commonly use double-precision (64-bit). This difference in precision can cause the tiny differences you're seeing.\n\n2. **Parallelism and Non-determinism**:\n   - GPUs perform many operations in parallel, which can lead to non-deterministic results due to variations in the order of operations. This can especially affect floating-point operations where the associative law (i.e., (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)) does not hold due to rounding errors.\n\n3. **Optimization Differences**:\n   - Compiler optimizations can differ between CPU and GPU, leading to different results. These optimizations might change the way calculations are performed or even the order of operations, which can affect floating-point precision.\n\n4. **Library Implementations**:\n   - Different libraries (numpy for CPU and gnumpy for GPU) might have slightly different implementations for the same operations, which could lead to variations in results.\n\n5. **Hardware Differences**:\n   - The architecture of GPU and CPU is fundamentally different, and this can lead to variations in results due to differences in how arithmetic operations are handled at the hardware level.\n\nIn general, small differences on the order of 10^-5 are quite typical and usually not a cause for concern, especially when working with neural networks. The inherent stochastic nature of training neural networks often means that such small variations do not significantly affect the overall performance or convergence.\n\nHowever, if you notice that these differences are leading to significant discrepancies in the behavior or performance of your neural network, you might consider:\n\n- Increasing the precision of your GPU computations if possible.\n- Ensuring that your gradient checking and other validations are tolerant of small numerical differences.\n- Double-checking your implementation to ensure that the differences are not due to a bug or incorrect assumption.\n\nOverall, as long as your neural network is converging as expected and the results are within an acceptable range, these minor discrepancies should not pose a problem."
