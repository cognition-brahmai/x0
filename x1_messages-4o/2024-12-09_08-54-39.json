        "content": "Certainly! Quicksort is a popular and efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort elements in an array or list. Here's a simple implementation of the quicksort algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\ndef quicksort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    else:\n        pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]\n        left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]\n        middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]\n        right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]\n        return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)\n\n# Example usage\narr = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]\nsorted_arr = quicksort(arr)\nprint(\"Sorted array:\", sorted_arr)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Base Case:** If the array has 0 or 1 element, it is already sorted, so we return it as is.\n2. **Pivot Selection:** We select a pivot element from the array. In this case, we choose the middle element.\n3. **Partitioning:**\n   - We create three lists:\n     - `left`: Contains all elements less than the pivot.\n     - `middle`: Contains all elements equal to the pivot.\n     - `right`: Contains all elements greater than the pivot.\n4. **Recursive Sorting:** We recursively apply the quicksort function to the `left` and `right` sub-arrays and concatenate the results with the `middle` list.\n\nThis implementation is straightforward and works well for small to medium-sized arrays. For larger arrays or to optimize further, additional techniques such as choosing a better pivot or using in-place partitioning can be considered."
