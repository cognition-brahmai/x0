The error occurs when I run the following code:\n\n```python\ntest_image = test_media.file\noriginal = Image.open(test_image)\n\nwidth, height = original.size   # Get dimensions\nleft = width/2\ntop = height/2\nright = width/2\nbottom = height/2\ncropped_example = original.crop((left, top, right, bottom))\n\ncropped_example.show()\n```\n\nI initially found a cropping example for PIL and assumed it would work the same for Pillow, but I'm facing issues."

        "content": "The error \"tile cannot extend outside image\" occurs when the cropping coordinates you provide are not valid. Specifically, this happens when the right and bottom coordinates are less than or equal to the left and top coordinates, effectively creating a zero-sized crop area.\n\nIn your code, the values for `left`, `top`, `right`, and `bottom` are all set to `width/2` and `height/2`, which means you're trying to crop a zero-sized region. To fix this, you'll need to specify a valid rectangular area that has a positive width and height. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to crop the center portion of the image:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\n\ntest_image = test_media.file\noriginal = Image.open(test_image)\n\nwidth, height = original.size   # Get dimensions\n\n# Define the size of the crop (e.g., 100x100 pixels)\ncrop_width = 100\ncrop_height = 100\n\n# Calculate the coordinates for the crop\nleft = (width - crop_width) / 2\ntop = (height - crop_height) / 2\nright = left + crop_width\nbottom = top + crop_height\n\n# Ensure the crop area is within the image bounds\nleft = max(0, left)\ntop = max(0, top)\nright = min(width, right)\nbottom = min(height, bottom)\n\n# Crop the image\ncropped_example = original.crop((left, top, right, bottom))\n\n# Show the cropped image\ncropped_example.show()\n```\n\nIn this code, I've added a specific crop size (`crop_width` and `crop_height`) and adjusted the crop coordinates to center the crop area. Additionally, the code ensures that the crop coordinates are within the image bounds. Adjust the `crop_width` and `crop_height` values as needed to fit your requirements."
