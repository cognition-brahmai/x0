        "content": "In Python 3, why does the syntax of a lambda function within a 'sorted' function cause an error? This function `sort_dictionary` is meant to sort a dictionary in descending order of values and then by keys alphabetically. The dictionary input might look like this: `{ 'this': 1, 'is': 1, 'a': 1, 'large': 2, 'sentence': 1 }`. This function works perfectly in Python 2.7.2 but it causes a SyntaxError in Python 3.2.3. The error message is as follows: \n```\n  File \"frequency.py\", line 87\n    for entry in sorted(wordDict.iteritems(), key = lambda (k, v): (-v, k)):\n                                                           ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n```\nWhat could be the reason for this difference in behavior between the two Python versions?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to a change in the syntax of lambda functions between Python 2 and Python 3. In Python 2, you could use tuple unpacking directly in the lambda function's parameter list, as seen in your example with `(k, v)`. However, in Python 3, this form of tuple unpacking in function parameters is no longer allowed, which results in a `SyntaxError`.\n\nTo solve this issue in Python 3, you need to modify the lambda function to unpack the tuple inside the function body instead of the parameter list. Here's how you can rewrite the `sort_dictionary` function to work in Python 3:\n\n```python\ndef sort_dictionary(wordDict):\n    return sorted(wordDict.items(), key=lambda item: (-item[1], item[0]))\n\n# Example usage:\nwordDict = {'this': 1, 'is': 1, 'a': 1, 'large': 2, 'sentence': 1}\nsorted_dict = sort_dictionary(wordDict)\nprint(sorted_dict)\n```\n\nIn this updated version, `wordDict.items()` is used instead of `wordDict.iteritems()`, which is another change from Python 2 to Python 3. The `items()` method in Python 3 returns an iterator similar to `iteritems()` in Python 2.\n\nThe `lambda` function now takes a single parameter `item`, which is a tuple containing the key and value, and then unpacks the tuple within the body using `item[0]` for the key and `item[1]` for the value. This approach works seamlessly in Python 3."
