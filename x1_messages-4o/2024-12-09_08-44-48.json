The value in column 'A' is greater than 3 (which should return row 2)\n2. The values in columns 'A' and 'B' are greater than 4 and 3 respectively (which should return row 4)\n3. The value in column 'A' is greater than 3 and either the value in column 'B' is greater than 3 or the value in column 'C' is greater than 2 (which should return row 2)\n\nMoreover, if there isn't any row that fulfills the specific criteria, I want to get the first one after I just sort it descending by 'A' (or other cases by 'B', 'C', etc). For example:\n\n4. Get the first row where 'A' is greater than 6 (which should return row 4 by ordering it by 'A' in descending order and getting the first one)\n\nI was able to do it by iterating over the dataframe, but I would prefer a more pythonic solution.\n\nHere is the dataframe I am working with:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.DataFrame([[1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 2], [4, 6, 3], [4, 3, 4], [5, 4, 5]], columns=['A', 'B', 'C'])\n```"

        "content": "To achieve your goals in a more Pythonic way using Pandas, you can use boolean indexing combined with the `iloc` method to retrieve the first row that matches your criteria. Here\u2019s how you can do it for each of your specified conditions:\n\n1. **First row where the value in column 'A' is greater than 3:**\n\n   ```python\n   first_row_A_gt_3 = df[df['A'] > 3].iloc[0]\n   print(first_row_A_gt_3)\n   ```\n\n2. **First row where the values in columns 'A' and 'B' are greater than 4 and 3 respectively:**\n\n   ```python\n   first_row_A_gt_4_B_gt_3 = df[(df['A'] > 4) & (df['B'] > 3)].iloc[0]\n   print(first_row_A_gt_4_B_gt_3)\n   ```\n\n3. **First row where the value in column 'A' is greater than 3 and either the value in column 'B' is greater than 3 or the value in column 'C' is greater than 2:**\n\n   ```python\n   first_row_complex_condition = df[(df['A'] > 3) & ((df['B'] > 3) | (df['C'] > 2))].iloc[0]\n   print(first_row_complex_condition)\n   ```\n\n4. **If there isn't any row that fulfills the specific criteria, get the first one after sorting descending by 'A':**\n\n   ```python\n   filtered_df = df[df['A'] > 6]\n   if not filtered_df.empty:\n       first_row_A_gt_6 = filtered_df.iloc[0]\n   else:\n       first_row_A_desc = df.sort_values(by='A', ascending=False).iloc[0]\n   print(first_row_A_desc)\n   ```\n\nThese methods use boolean indexing to filter the dataframe based on the conditions you specified and use `iloc[0]` to select the first row that meets the criteria. If no row meets the criteria, the fourth method shows how you can sort the dataframe and select the first row."
