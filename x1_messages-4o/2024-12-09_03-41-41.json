I installed `pip` successfully, but when I try to install Pygame with `pip`, I am seeing an error: \"Could not install requirement Pygame because of HTTP error HTTP error 400: Bad request for URL ...\". I attempted to use the command `pip install hg+http://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame` as suggested in a Stack Overflow answer, but it gave me another error: \"Cannot find command hg\". With most online resources being for Mac, I am unsure how to proceed with my Windows system. Can anyone guide me on how to solve this issue?"

        "content": "To install Pygame on your Windows 7 system using the Enthought Python Distribution, you can try the following steps to resolve the issues you're facing:\n\n1. **Ensure Python and Pip are Properly Installed**: \n   - First, ensure that your Python installation is correctly configured. You should be able to run Python and pip commands from your command prompt. If not, you may need to add Python to your system's PATH environment variable.\n\n2. **Install Mercurial**:\n   - The error \"Cannot find command hg\" indicates that Mercurial (a version control system) is not installed. You can download and install Mercurial from [here](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/downloads). Make sure to add Mercurial to your PATH during installation so that the `hg` command can be recognized in your Command Prompt.\n\n3. **Use a Precompiled Pygame Binary**:\n   - Since compiling from source can be complex, especially on Windows, using a precompiled binary can simplify the process. Visit [Pygame's download page](https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml) and look for a Windows installer that matches your version of Python (32-bit or 64-bit) and Python version.\n\n4. **Install Pygame using Pip**:\n   - Once you have ensured that Python and pip are correctly installed and accessible, try installing Pygame using the following command:\n     ```\n     pip install pygame\n     ```\n   - If this still results in errors, you can try downloading the appropriate `.whl` file from [Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame). Once downloaded, you can install it using:\n     ```\n     pip install path_to_downloaded_whl_file\n     ```\n\n5. **Check for Compatibility Issues**:\n   - Ensure that the version of Pygame you are trying to install is compatible with your version of Python. Pygame requires Python 3.6 or later.\n\n6. **Network and Permissions**:\n   - If you're still facing HTTP errors, check your network connection and ensure that any firewall or proxy settings aren't blocking pip.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully install Pygame on your Windows 7 system. If you encounter any specific errors during the process, feel free to ask for further assistance."
