I have a sample series that I created using numpy's random function and pandas. I am able to plot the cumulative histogram using `s.hist(cumulative=True, normed=1)` and the CDF using `sns.kdeplot(s, cumulative=True)`. However, I am looking for a method that does both, similar to how `sns.distplot(s)` gives both the kde fit and the histogram. Is there a way to accomplish this?\n\nThe code I have is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\ns = pd.Series(np.random.normal(size=1000))\n```"

        "content": "To achieve the desired outcome of plotting both a cumulative histogram and a Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) using only Seaborn, you can combine Seaborn's `displot` or `histplot` with `kdeplot`. Unfortunately, Seaborn does not have a built-in function that directly overlays a cumulative histogram with a CDF like `distplot` does for non-cumulative plots. However, you can layer plots in Seaborn to achieve the desired visualization. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Generate a Pandas Series with random normal data\ns = pd.Series(np.random.normal(size=1000))\n\n# Create a cumulative histogram with Seaborn\nsns.histplot(s, bins=30, cumulative=True, stat='density', element='step', fill=False, color='blue', label='Cumulative Histogram')\n\n# Plot the CDF using Seaborn's kdeplot\nsns.kdeplot(s, cumulative=True, color='red', label='CDF')\n\n# Add a legend and labels\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel('Value')\nplt.ylabel('Cumulative Density')\nplt.title('Cumulative Histogram and CDF')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis code snippet will create a plot that overlays a cumulative histogram and a CDF on the same graph. Here\u2019s a breakdown of how it works:\n- `sns.histplot` is used to create the cumulative histogram. The `cumulative=True` argument specifies that the histogram should be cumulative, `stat='density'` normalizes the histogram to form a probability density, and `element='step'` with `fill=False` makes it look like a line plot rather than a filled histogram.\n- `sns.kdeplot` is used to plot the CDF, with the `cumulative=True` argument to make it cumulative.\n- `plt.legend()` is used to add a legend to distinguish between the cumulative histogram and the CDF.\n- Labels and a title are added for clarity. \n\nThis approach gives you the flexibility of Seaborn while achieving the visualization you are looking for."
