I have discovered the `os.walk()` and `os.listdir()` functions which may allow me to recursively descend into directories, building a Python object along the way. However, this feels like reinventing the wheel. Does anyone know of a working code solution to accomplish this task? The JSON should be in the following format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"directory\",\n  \"name\": \"hello\",\n  \"children\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"directory\",\n      \"name\": \"world\",\n      \"children\": [\n        {\n          \"type\": \"file\",\n          \"name\": \"one.txt\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"type\": \"file\",\n          \"name\": \"two.txt\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"file\",\n      \"name\": \"README\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"

        "content": "To generate a JSON representation of a directory tree in the specified format, you can use Python's `os` module in combination with `json`. Here's a simple function that utilizes `os.walk()` to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport json\n\ndef get_directory_tree(path):\n    def build_tree(current_path):\n        tree = {\n            \"type\": \"directory\",\n            \"name\": os.path.basename(current_path),\n            \"children\": []\n        }\n        \n        try:\n            entries = os.listdir(current_path)\n        except PermissionError:\n            return tree  # Skip directories that can't be accessed\n        \n        for entry in entries:\n            full_path = os.path.join(current_path, entry)\n            if os.path.isdir(full_path):\n                tree[\"children\"].append(build_tree(full_path))\n            else:\n                tree[\"children\"].append({\n                    \"type\": \"file\",\n                    \"name\": entry\n                })\n        \n        return tree\n    \n    return build_tree(path)\n\n# Usage\ndirectory_path = '/path/to/your/directory'\ndirectory_tree = get_directory_tree(directory_path)\ndirectory_tree_json = json.dumps(directory_tree, indent=4)\n\nprint(directory_tree_json)\n```\n\n### How It Works:\n1. **`get_directory_tree(path)`:** This function takes a directory path as input and recursively builds a tree structure.\n2. **`build_tree(current_path)`:** This nested function constructs a tree dictionary for each directory. It initializes a dictionary for the current directory and iterates over its contents.\n3. **`os.listdir(current_path)`:** Lists all entries in the current directory. It handles directories and files separately.\n4. **Recursive Calls:** If an entry is a directory, the function calls itself recursively to build a tree for that subdirectory.\n5. **File Handling:** If an entry is a file, it appends a file dictionary to the `children` list with the `type` set to `file` and the `name` set to the filename.\n6. **JSON Output:** The resulting tree structure is converted to JSON using `json.dumps()` with indentation for readability.\n\nReplace `/path/to/your/directory` with the actual path of the directory you want to scan. This script will output the directory tree in the specified JSON format."
