Here is my code:\n\n```python\nclass C:\n    def __init__(self, format):\n        self.format = format\n\n    def process(self, formatting=self.format):\n        print(formatting)\n```\n\nWhen I run this, I get a `NameError: name 'self' is not defined` error. I want the method to behave as follows:\n\n```python\nC(\"abc\").process()       # prints \"abc\"\nC(\"abc\").process(\"xyz\")  # prints \"xyz\"\n```\n\nCan someone explain why this doesn't work and how I can achieve my desired behavior?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the way default arguments are evaluated in Python. Default argument values are evaluated only once when the function is defined, not each time the function is called. This means that `self` is not defined at the time the default value is being evaluated, which is why you're getting a `NameError`.\n\nTo achieve the desired behavior, you can set the default value inside the method body instead of in the method signature. Here's how you can do that:\n\n```python\nclass C:\n    def __init__(self, format):\n        self.format = format\n\n    def process(self, formatting=None):\n        if formatting is None:\n            formatting = self.format\n        print(formatting)\n\n# Usage:\nC(\"abc\").process()       # prints \"abc\"\nC(\"abc\").process(\"xyz\")  # prints \"xyz\"\n```\n\nIn this version, the `process` method takes an optional parameter `formatting`, which defaults to `None`. Inside the method, it checks if `formatting` is `None` and, if so, assigns it the value of `self.format`. This approach ensures that the default value of `formatting` can depend on the instance's state."
