        "content": "To extract URLs from a string in Python, you can use regular expressions (regex). Here's a simple way to do it using the `re` module:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_urls(text):\n    # Define the regex pattern for a URL\n    url_pattern = r'(https?://[^\\s]+)'\n    \n    # Find all occurrences of the pattern\n    urls = re.findall(url_pattern, text)\n    \n    return urls\n\n# Example usage\nsample_text = \"Here are some URLs: https://example.com and http://test.com/page.\"\nurls = extract_urls(sample_text)\nprint(urls)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The `url_pattern` uses a regular expression to match URLs. Here's a breakdown:\n  - `https?://` matches `http://` or `https://`.\n  - `[^\\s]+` matches one or more characters that are not whitespace, which usually makes up the rest of the URL.\n- The `re.findall` function is used to find all substrings in the input text that match the pattern, returning them as a list.\n\nThis approach will give you a list of URLs found in the input string. You can customize the regex pattern if you need to accommodate more specific URL formats."
