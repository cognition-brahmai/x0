Since you have a table named \"voice_notes\" with columns \"id\" and \"note_content\", here's how you can insert the given voice note text into the table:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO voice_notes (id, note_content) \nVALUES (1, 'Hey, I need you to pick up some food for me. Can you get me a small pizza and some chicken wings?');\n```\n\nIn this example, I'm assuming that the `id` column is not auto-incrementing and needs to be specified manually. If your `id` column is auto-incrementing, you don't need to specify an `id` value in the `INSERT` statement:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO voice_notes (note_content) \nVALUES ('Hey, I need you to pick up some food for me. Can you get me a small pizza and some chicken wings?');\n```\n\nMake sure to adjust the `id` value or omit it if necessary, based on your table's schema."
