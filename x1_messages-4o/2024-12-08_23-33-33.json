        "content": "Can you design a keyboard that not only provides the functionality of a typical keyboard but also gives the feeling of typing on a vintage typewriter and produces the same sound? However, your design should also be ergonomic and comfortable for prolonged use. To make it more interesting, can you create custom keycaps that feature iconic symbols and characters from classic literature? But, here's the twist, you cannot use any keys from a standard QWERTY layout. You need to come up with a unique layout that requires reasoning to understand and use. Lastly, to showcase your creativity and knowledge, can you design a website that not only showcases your unique keyboard design but also provides step-by-step tutorials for others to create their own custom keyboards? This task requires not only technical knowledge and expertise in 3D printing and software development, but also a passion for vintage design and literature, and the ability to think outside the box for a truly unique keyboard experience."

        "content": "### Keyboard Design Concept\n\n#### 1. **Mechanical Mechanism & Sound:**\n- **Switches:** Utilize custom mechanical switches with a higher actuation force to mimic the resistance of vintage typewriter keys. Incorporate a tactile bump and a distinct click sound on actuation.\n- **Sound Resonance:** Integrate a small resonating chamber beneath each key to amplify the click sound, mimicking the classic typewriter acoustics.\n\n#### 2. **Ergonomic Design:**\n- **Split Keyboard Layout:** Design a split keyboard to reduce strain on hands and wrists. Each half can be angled and tilted for personalized comfort.\n- **Curved Key Rows:** Arrange the keys in a curved, concave layout to match the natural curvature of fingers.\n\n#### 3. **Unique Layout:**\n- **Non-QWERTY Layout:** Create a layout where keys are grouped based on frequency of use and linguistic patterns. For instance, vowels can be clustered together, and common consonants placed strategically around them.\n- **Reasoning Pattern:** Use a spiral arrangement starting from the center (most used keys) to the periphery (less used keys), prompting users to think about key locations based on usage patterns.\n\n#### 4. **Custom Keycaps:**\n- **Literature Symbols:** Design keycaps featuring symbols from classic literature such as the quill (writing), an owl (wisdom), or a raven (mystery).\n- **Material and Finish:** Use high-quality resin with a matte finish for a vintage look and feel.\n\n### Website Design Concept\n\n#### 1. **Homepage:**\n- **Visual Appeal:** Use a vintage typewriter theme with parchment background and sepia tones. Include high-resolution images of the keyboard.\n- **Interactive 3D Model:** Embed an interactive 3D model of the keyboard for users to explore the design intricately.\n\n#### 2. **Design Showcase:**\n- **Gallery:** Display images and videos of the keyboard in various stages of development.\n- **Features Section:** Highlight the unique features of the keyboard, including the sound mechanism, ergonomic design, and custom keycaps.\n\n#### 3. **Tutorials Section:**\n- **Step-by-Step Guides:** Provide comprehensive guides on creating custom keyboards, covering topics like 3D printing keycaps, programming custom layouts, and assembling mechanical switches.\n- **Video Content:** Include video tutorials for each step, from the design process to final assembly.\n\n#### 4. **Community Forum:**\n- **User Engagement:** Create a forum for enthusiasts to share their designs, modifications, and experiences.\n- **Literature Discussions:** Host a section for discussions on classic literature, inspiring connections between users' custom designs and their favorite literary works.\n\n#### 5. **Shop & Resources:**\n- **Purchase Options:** Offer resources to purchase parts and tools needed for keyboard creation.\n- **Resource Library:** Provide links to software tools, design templates, and suppliers for materials.\n\n### Implementation Strategy\n\n- **3D Printing Expertise:** Partner with a 3D printing firm to prototype keycaps and keyboard frames.\n- **Software Development:** Use HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for front-end development, ensuring the website is responsive and interactive. Back-end support with Python (Django/Flask) or Node.js for handling user data and forum discussions.\n- **Community Building:** Create social media pages and a newsletter to keep users engaged and informed about new tutorials and community projects.\n\nThis design concept integrates vintage aesthetics with modern ergonomic principles, creating a nostalgic yet functional typing experience. The website serves as both a showcase and a resource hub, empowering users to craft their unique keyboards while fostering a community of enthusiasts."
