Note that whether `include_package_data` is commented out or not does not make a difference."

        "content": "To include a sample configuration file in the binary egg distribution (`bdist_egg`) and ensure it is installed into the `{prefix}/etc` directory, you can modify your `setup.py` script as follows:\n\n1. Use `setuptools` to handle the installation instead of `distutils`. This will simplify the process and ensure compatibility with `bdist_egg`.\n\n2. Use the `package_data` or `include_package_data` parameters to include non-code files like configuration files in your binary distribution.\n\n3. Use a custom command class to handle the installation of configuration files to system directories like `{prefix}/etc`, since `setuptools` typically does not allow this by default for security reasons.\n\nHere is how you can modify your `setup.py`:\n\n```python\nfrom setuptools import setup, Command\nimport os\nimport shutil\n\nclass InstallDataFilesCommand(Command):\n    \"\"\"A custom command to install data files to {prefix}/etc.\"\"\"\n    description = 'Install configuration files to {prefix}/etc'\n    user_options = []\n\n    def initialize_options(self):\n        pass\n\n    def finalize_options(self):\n        pass\n\n    def run(self):\n        # Define the target directory for installation\n        target_directory = os.path.join(self.prefix, 'etc')\n        # Create the directory if it does not exist\n        os.makedirs(target_directory, exist_ok=True)\n        # Copy the configuration file\n        shutil.copy('etc/myapp.cfg', target_directory)\n\nsetup(\n    name='MyApp',\n    version='0.1',\n    packages=['myapp'],\n    scripts=['bin/myapp'],\n    cmdclass={\n        'install_data_files': InstallDataFilesCommand\n    },\n    data_files=[\n        # This is to ensure it is included in the source distribution\n        ('etc', ['etc/myapp.cfg']),\n    ],\n    include_package_data=True,  # Ensure package data is included\n    test_suite='nose.collector',\n)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Custom Command (`InstallDataFilesCommand`):**\n  - This command handles copying the configuration file to `{prefix}/etc`.\n  - The `run` method uses `os.makedirs` to ensure the target directory exists and `shutil.copy` to move the file.\n\n- **`cmdclass` Parameter:**\n  - Add a custom command (`install_data_files`) to perform the copying of data files.\n\n- **`data_files` Parameter:**\n  - This ensures the file is included in the source distribution, even though the actual installation path is handled in the custom command.\n\n- **`include_package_data=True`:**\n  - This flag ensures that all package data specified in `MANIFEST.in` or automatically detected is included in the distribution.\n\n### Note:\n\n- It's important to run your custom command after the installation, which might require some additional script or adjustments.\n- `{prefix}` should generally be managed by the installation process, so ensure you handle permissions and paths appropriately.\n- This approach assumes you are running the installation with sufficient permissions to write to the `{prefix}/etc` directory.\n\nBy using this approach, you ensure that your configuration file is included in the egg distribution and installed to the desired directory during installation."
