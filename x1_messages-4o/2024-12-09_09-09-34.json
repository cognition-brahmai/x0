        "content": "Yes, you can merge two arrays and remove duplicate elements in JavaScript using a combination of the spread operator and the `Set` object. Here's a simple way to do it:\n\n```javascript\n// Define two arrays\nconst array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];\nconst array2 = [3, 4, 5, 6];\n\n// Merge arrays and remove duplicates\nconst mergedArray = [...new Set([...array1, ...array2])];\n\nconsole.log(mergedArray);\n```\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Spread Operator**: The spread operator (`...`) is used to concatenate `array1` and `array2` into a new array.\n\n2. **Set Object**: A `Set` is a collection of unique values, meaning it automatically removes any duplicate elements.\n\n3. **Spread the Set into an Array**: Finally, the spread operator is used again to convert the `Set` back into an array.\n\nAs a result, `mergedArray` will contain only unique elements from both `array1` and `array2`. In this example, it will output:\n\n```\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\nThis method is both concise and efficient for merging arrays and eliminating duplicates."
