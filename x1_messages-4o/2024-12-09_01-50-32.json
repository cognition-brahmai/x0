        "content": "The syntax error you're encountering is due to the way you're trying to index the numpy array. When you want to extract specific columns from a numpy array, you should use proper indexing. In numpy, you can use a tuple for indexing, where the first element specifies the row indices (or a slice) and the second element specifies the column indices.\n\nHere's how you can extract specific columns from a numpy array:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Example MxN matrix\ndata = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],\n                 [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20],\n                 [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]])\n\n# Extract columns with indices 1 and 9\nextractedData = data[:, [1, 9]]\n\nprint(extractedData)\n```\n\nIn this example, `data[:, [1, 9]]` is used to extract the columns at index 1 and index 9 from all rows. The `:` operator means \"all rows\", and `[1, 9]` specifies the list of column indices you want to extract. This will give you a new numpy array with just the specified columns."
