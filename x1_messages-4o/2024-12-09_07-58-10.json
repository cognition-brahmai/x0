I am currently manually creating a list of indexes that are not in the sample indexes. Given the constraints like large data set, threading, and very low memory on the system, I am looking for a more efficient way to get indexes of a numpy array that are not in a given list. Here is a sample of my current approach:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport scipy.spatial.distance as sd\n\ndata = np.array(\n    [[ 0.93825827,  0.26701143],\n     [ 0.99121108,  0.35582816],\n     [ 0.90154837,  0.86254049],\n     [ 0.83149103,  0.42222948],\n     [ 0.27309625,  0.38925281],\n     [ 0.06510739,  0.58445673],\n     [ 0.61469637,  0.05420098],\n     [ 0.92685408,  0.62715114],\n     [ 0.22587817,  0.56819403],\n     [ 0.28400409,  0.21112043]]\n)\n\nsample_indexes = [1,2,3]\n\n# I'd rather not make this\nother_indexes = list(set(range(len(data))) - set(sample_indexes))\n\nsample_data = data[sample_indexes]\nother_data = data[other_indexes]\n\n# compare them\ndists = sd.cdist(sample_data, other_data)\n```\n\nI would like to do something like `other_data = data[ indexes not in sample_indexes]`. I've heard that numpy masks can do this but when I tried `other_data = data[~sample_indexes]`, I received an error. Do I have to create a mask?"

Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport scipy.spatial.distance as sd\n\ndata = np.array(\n    [[ 0.93825827,  0.26701143],\n     [ 0.99121108,  0.35582816],\n     [ 0.90154837,  0.86254049],\n     [ 0.83149103,  0.42222948],\n     [ 0.27309625,  0.38925281],\n     [ 0.06510739,  0.58445673],\n     [ 0.61469637,  0.05420098],\n     [ 0.92685408,  0.62715114],\n     [ 0.22587817,  0.56819403],\n     [ 0.28400409,  0.21112043]]\n)\n\nsample_indexes = [1, 2, 3]\n\n# Create a boolean mask for all elements\nmask = np.ones(len(data), dtype=bool)\n\n# Set the mask for sample_indexes to False\nmask[sample_indexes] = False\n\n# Use the mask to select elements not in sample_indexes\nother_data = data[mask]\n\n# Now you can compute distances\nsample_data = data[sample_indexes]\ndists = sd.cdist(sample_data, other_data)\n\nprint(dists)\n```\n\nIn this method, you create a boolean mask initialized to `True`. Then, you set the elements that correspond to your `sample_indexes` to `False`. Finally, you use this mask to select the elements of `data` that are not in `sample_indexes`. This approach is efficient and avoids the need to manually create the list of \"other\" indexes."
