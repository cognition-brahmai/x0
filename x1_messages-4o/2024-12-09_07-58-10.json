        "content": "I have an asynchronous stream of events, where each event contains information about the agency, agent, served-entity, date and time, and class-data. I need to correlate an event based on Served-Entity, Date+Time and Class-Data, and create a consolidated new event. For example, I have the following events:\n\nEvent #0021: { Agency='XYZ', Agent='ABC', Served-Entity='MMN', Date+Time='12-03-2011/11:03:37', Class-Date='missed-delivery,no-repeat,untracable,orphan' }\n\nEvent #0193: { Agency='KLM', Agent='DAY', Served-Entity='MMN', Date+Time='12-03-2011/12:32:21', Class-Date='missed-delivery,orphan,lost' }\n\nEvent #1217: { Agency='KLM', Agent='CARE', Served-Entity='MMN', Date+Time='12-03-2011/18:50:45', Class-Date='escalated' }\n\nThese three events, which are spaced out in time (more than 7hr separation), are for the same Served-Entity (MMN), occur within a certain time window (say 24-hours), have matching or related Class-Data. I would like to create a consolidated (new) event which could represent an inference drawn. Furthermore, I would like to create reports on a per Agency, per Agency, per Served-Entity basis, based on things like specific Class-Data tags (e.g. missed-delivery) over a certain period of time. This could be done using the original/input events, or the synthesized (inference) events. Also, it is likely in future, that the \"tags\" that appear in Class-Data could grow, without any human intervention. So not sure if this should then be treated as unstructured data. Another future requirement could be to identify trends / patterns of event occurrences (i.e. Event1 led to Event2 led to Event3). The event arrival rate could be quite high, possibly thousands of events per minute, and I need to archive the original/synthesized events for a period of time (a month or so). My solution needs to be based on FOSS components (preferably). I have done some research so far, which points in the direction of CEP (Complex Event Processing), Bayesian-Networks/Classification, Predictive-Analytics. I am looking for suggestions regarding the approach to take. I'd prefer to take the path which meets most of my goals, with minimum difficulty/time, or to put another way, \"learning AI\" or \"formal statistical methods\" isn't my short-term goal. Can anyone provide guidance on how to achieve this?"

        "content": "To address your requirements, you can consider a solution that leverages Complex Event Processing (CEP) along with other FOSS components to create a system capable of correlating, synthesizing, and analyzing events. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Event Collection and Storage:**\n   - Use a message broker like Apache Kafka to handle the high throughput of incoming events. Kafka can handle thousands of events per minute and provides durability and scalability.\n   - Store the raw events in a database that supports time-series data, like InfluxDB or a NoSQL database like MongoDB, which can handle unstructured data and allows for flexible schema evolution as the Class-Data tags grow.\n\n2. **Event Processing and Correlation:**\n   - Implement a CEP engine such as Apache Flink or Esper. These tools are designed for real-time event processing and can correlate events based on your criteria (Served-Entity, Date+Time, Class-Data).\n   - Define rules or patterns in the CEP engine to identify events that meet your correlation criteria and generate synthesized events.\n\n3. **Data Analysis and Reporting:**\n   - Use a data visualization tool like Apache Superset or Grafana to create dashboards and reports. These tools can connect to your database and provide rich visualization capabilities.\n   - For more advanced analytics, consider integrating with a data processing library like Apache Spark, which can perform complex queries and machine learning tasks.\n\n4. **Trend Analysis and Pattern Recognition:**\n   - For trend analysis, you can use the capabilities of Spark or Flink to identify patterns over time, such as sequences of related events.\n   - Implement machine learning models if needed for predictive analytics, using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, but this can be considered as an extension once the basic infrastructure is in place.\n\n5. **Archival and Retention:**\n   - Configure your storage solution to retain data for the desired period (e.g., one month). Tools like Kafka have built-in retention policies, and databases like MongoDB offer TTL (time-to-live) indexes to automatically delete old data.\n\nBy following this approach, you can build a robust system using FOSS components that meets your requirements for event correlation, synthesis, reporting, and trend analysis, without delving deeply into AI or formal statistical methods initially. This setup allows for future expansion into predictive analytics if your needs evolve."
