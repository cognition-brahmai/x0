        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests there is a mismatch between your code and the version of the Jinja2 library installed on your system. The `escape` function or object might have been moved or deprecated in recent versions of Jinja2.\n\nHere are several steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Jinja2 Version**: First, check the version of Jinja2 installed on your system. You can do this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip show jinja2\n   ```\n\n   This will display the version number. If it's a newer version, you might need to downgrade to an older version that still supports `escape` in the way your code expects.\n\n2. **Downgrade Jinja2**: If necessary, you can downgrade to an earlier version of Jinja2. For example, if your code was working with Jinja2 version 2.11.3, you can install it explicitly:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install jinja2==2.11.3\n   ```\n\n3. **Modify the Import Statement**: If downgrading isn't an option, you might want to look at the Jinja2 documentation or source code to find where `escape` is located in the current version. It may have been moved to a different module or needs to be accessed differently.\n\n4. **Check for Updates or Patches**: Check the repository or documentation of the library you're using that requires `escape` to see if there's an update or patch that resolves compatibility with newer Jinja2 versions.\n\n5. **Virtual Environment**: Consider using a virtual environment to manage your dependencies. This helps in isolating your project's dependencies from the system Python environment. You can create a virtual environment and install your packages within it:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\\Scripts\\activate`\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n6. **Review Release Notes**: Review the release notes of Jinja2 to see if there are any breaking changes related to the `escape` function.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the ImportError related to the `escape` function from the Jinja2 library."
