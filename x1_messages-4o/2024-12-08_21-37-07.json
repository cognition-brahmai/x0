Once the decimal number (28) is obtained, what is the mathematical expression to convert it into an 8-bit binary number taking into account the binary representation of each decimal digit? Lastly, how do you output the resulting binary number as a string of 0s and 1s separated by a delimiter? Please provide the specific Java code to accomplish this task."

        "content": "Certainly! Let's break down the task into steps and provide the Java code for each part:\n\n1. **Calculate the Number of Days in February for a Given Year:**\n   - Check if the year is a leap year. If it is, February has 29 days; otherwise, it has 28 days.\n\n2. **Convert the Decimal Number to an 8-bit Binary Number:**\n   - Convert the number 28 (days in February for a non-leap year) into its binary representation.\n\n3. **Output the Binary Number as a String of 0s and 1s Separated by a Delimiter:**\n   - Convert the binary number to a string with a delimiter, like a comma.\n\nHere's the Java code implementing these steps:\n\n```java\npublic class FebruaryDaysBinary {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int year = 2024; // Example year\n        int daysInFebruary = getDaysInFebruary(year);\n        \n        // Convert the number of days to an 8-bit binary number\n        String binaryRepresentation = convertTo8BitBinary(daysInFebruary);\n        \n        // Output the binary number as a string of 0s and 1s separated by a delimiter\n        String outputWithDelimiter = addDelimiterToBinaryString(binaryRepresentation, ',');\n        \n        System.out.println(\"Year: \" + year);\n        System.out.println(\"Days in February: \" + daysInFebruary);\n        System.out.println(\"Binary Representation: \" + outputWithDelimiter);\n    }\n\n    // Function to determine the number of days in February for a given year\n    public static int getDaysInFebruary(int year) {\n        if ((year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0)) {\n            return 29; // Leap year\n        }\n        return 28; // Non-leap year\n    }\n\n    // Function to convert a decimal number to an 8-bit binary string\n    public static String convertTo8BitBinary(int number) {\n        return String.format(\"%8s\", Integer.toBinaryString(number)).replace(' ', '0');\n    }\n\n    // Function to add a delimiter to a binary string\n    public static String addDelimiterToBinaryString(String binary, char delimiter) {\n        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();\n        for (int i = 0; i < binary.length(); i++) {\n            result.append(binary.charAt(i));\n            if (i < binary.length() - 1) {\n                result.append(delimiter);\n            }\n        }\n        return result.toString();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Leap Year Calculation:** The `getDaysInFebruary` method checks if a year is a leap year based on the rules of the Gregorian calendar.\n- **Binary Conversion:** The `convertTo8BitBinary` method converts the number of days to an 8-bit binary string. It ensures the binary string is 8 bits long by padding with leading zeros if necessary.\n- **Delimiter Addition:** The `addDelimiterToBinaryString` method adds a specified delimiter (in this case, a comma) between each digit of the binary string.\n\nThis code will output the binary representation of the number of days in February for any given year, separated by the chosen delimiter."
