I have confirmed that this is a `PATH` issue, as my `PYTHON_PATH` was initially empty. Despite setting it to `/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/django` and verifying that this path is in my `sys.path`, the issue persists. I also created a `/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/django.pth` file with the same path, but the problem remains. Later, I encountered an additional error \"No module named utils.version\". What could be causing these issues and how can I resolve them?"

        "content": "The issues you're encountering are likely due to the compatibility and configuration problems associated with using older versions of Python and Django. Here are some steps to help resolve these issues:\n\n1. **Verify Django Installation**: Ensure that Django is correctly installed. You can check this by running:\n   ```bash\n   python -c \"import django; print(django.get_version())\"\n   ```\n   If this command fails, it indicates that Django is not correctly installed in your environment.\n\n2. **Check Django Version Compatibility**: Django 1.3 is very old, and it is not compatible with some newer system libraries and Python versions. Make sure that your Django version is indeed 1.3 and that it is correctly installed for Python 2.5.\n\n3. **Correct Python Path**: Instead of setting `PYTHON_PATH`, make sure your environment's `PYTHONPATH` is set correctly. This variable should include the paths where Python looks for packages. You can set it in your shell configuration file (like `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`) as follows:\n   ```bash\n   export PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify Django Package Structure**: Since you mentioned missing modules, it's possible the Django installation might be incomplete or corrupted. You should verify that the required modules, such as `core.management` and `utils.version`, exist in the Django package directory.\n\n5. **Reinstall Django**: If the installation is incomplete, try reinstalling Django:\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall django\n   pip install django==1.3\n   ```\n   If `pip` is not available, you may need to install it first or use an alternative method to install Django.\n\n6. **Check for Legacy Support Libraries**: Some modules may have dependencies or require additional legacy libraries tailored for older versions of Python and Django. Ensure any such dependencies are resolved.\n\n7. **Use Virtual Environments**: It's a good practice to use virtual environments, especially when working with outdated software. This can help isolate the dependencies and configurations from the rest of the system. You can create a virtual environment for Python 2.5 and install Django 1.3 within it, ensuring compatibility:\n   ```bash\n   virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.5 myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n   pip install django==1.3\n   ```\n\n8. **Consider Upgrading**: If possible, consider upgrading to a more recent version of Python and Django. Python 2.5 and Django 1.3 are both obsolete and no longer supported, which may lead to security vulnerabilities and lack of features.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and fix the import errors you're facing. If problems persist, consider checking the official Django documentation for any additional setup or compatibility notes specific to the version you're using."
