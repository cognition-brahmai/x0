I can manually set a color array but I am looking for a more efficient way to do it. For context, here's how I've been doing it with three data sets:\n\n```python\nX = [1,2,3,4]\nY1 = [4,8,12,16]\nY2 = [1,4,9,16]\n\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nplt.scatter(X,Y1,color='red')\nplt.scatter(X,Y2,color='blue')\nplt.show()\n```\nI would like to know how to do this with 10 sets or more. I can easily assign a unique number to each data set if that helps."

        "content": "To automatically set a different color for each series in a scatter plot with multiple data sets, you can utilize Matplotlib's color cycler, which will automatically assign different colors from a predefined color cycle. This allows you to avoid manually specifying colors for each dataset.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Example data sets\nX = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])\nY = [\n    [4, 8, 12, 16],\n    [1, 4, 9, 16],\n    [2, 3, 5, 7],\n    [3, 6, 9, 12],\n    [1, 3, 5, 7],\n    [2, 4, 6, 8],\n    [3, 5, 7, 9],\n    [4, 6, 8, 10],\n    [5, 7, 9, 11],\n    [6, 8, 10, 12]\n]\n\n# Plotting each Y dataset with a unique color\nfor y in Y:\n    plt.scatter(X, y)\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this example, Matplotlib will automatically cycle through its default color cycle for each call to `plt.scatter()`. This will ensure each data series is plotted with a different color without the need to manually specify each color. You can also customize the color cycle by setting the `axes.prop_cycle` property to cycle through a list of colors you define, if desired."
