        "content": "In Python, comments are typically done using the `#` symbol, and they don't support inline comments within a continuation line (`\\`). This means that you can't insert comments directly on the same line using backslashes for line continuation.\n\nHowever, you can structure your code and comments in a way that makes it clear and easy to read. Here are some ways to include comments in multiline code:\n\n### Method 1: Using Separate Comment Lines\nInstead of trying to insert comments inline, you can use separate lines for comments:\n\n```python\n# Comment about the following block\nsomething = (\n    line_of_code *\n    # Comment about this line\n    another_line_of_code *\n    # Comment about this line\n    and_another_one *\n    # Comment about this line\n    etc\n)\n```\n\n### Method 2: Using a Block Comment\nIf you want to comment on a block of code, you can use a block comment before the code:\n\n```python\n# This block of code calculates something\n# It includes multiple operations\nsomething = (\n    line_of_code *\n    another_line_of_code *\n    and_another_one *\n    etc\n)\n```\n\n### Method 3: Using Triple Quotes for Documentation\nWhile not technically comments, you can use triple quotes as a way to include documentation or notes within your code. This won't be ignored by the interpreter, but it can serve as a multiline comment.\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThis block of code calculates something\nIt includes multiple operations\n\"\"\"\nsomething = (\n    line_of_code *\n    another_line_of_code *\n    and_another_one *\n    etc\n)\n```\n\nRemember, the best practice is to keep your comments clear and concise, and to use them to explain why the code is doing something, rather than what it is doing\u2014unless the code is complex and requires detailed explanation."
