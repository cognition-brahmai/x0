        "content": "Certainly! The span of an array is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. To find the span using Python, you can simply use the built-in functions `max()` and `min()` to calculate the maximum and minimum values, and then subtract the minimum from the maximum. Here's a simple implementation:\n\n```python\ndef find_span(arr):\n    if not arr:\n        raise ValueError(\"Array is empty\")\n    \n    max_value = max(arr)\n    min_value = min(arr)\n    \n    span = max_value - min_value\n    return span\n\n# Example usage:\narray = [3, 10, 6, 1, 8, 12, 4]\nspan = find_span(array)\nprint(f\"The span of the array is: {span}\")\n```\n\nThis program checks if the array is empty and raises an error if it is. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum and minimum values of the array and determines the span by subtracting the minimum from the maximum. You can test this function with different arrays to see how it works."
