        "content": "You can convert a large number into a list of its individual digits in Python by using a combination of string manipulation and list comprehension. Here's a simple way to achieve this:\n\n```python\nnumber = 43365644\ndigits_list = [int(digit) for digit in str(number)]\nprint(digits_list)\n```\n\nHere's how this code works:\n\n1. `str(number)` converts the number to a string, allowing you to iterate over each character (digit) in the number.\n2. The list comprehension `[int(digit) for digit in str(number)]` iterates over each character in the string, converts it back to an integer, and creates a list of these integers.\n3. `digits_list` will contain the individual digits of the number as elements of the list.\n\nWhen you run this code, `digits_list` will be `[4, 3, 3, 6, 5, 6, 4, 4]`."
