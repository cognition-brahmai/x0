I am working with two classes, one parent class 'A' and one subclass 'B'. In the last line of my code, I want to refer to the parent class 'A' with the \"self.f(num)\" command, instead of referring to the method in class 'B' which would create an infinite recursion. The code is as follows:\n\n```python\nclass A:\n    def __init__(self, num):\n        self.value=num\n    def f(self, num):\n        return self.value+2\nclass B(A):\n    def f(self, num):\n        return 7*self.f(num)\n```"

        "content": "To call a method from the parent class (class `A`) in Python when the method is overridden in a subclass (class `B`), you can use the `super()` function. This allows you to access the parent class's method without causing infinite recursion.\n\nHere is how you can modify your subclass `B` to use the method `f` from class `A`:\n\n```python\nclass A:\n    def __init__(self, num):\n        self.value = num\n\n    def f(self, num):\n        return self.value + 2\n\nclass B(A):\n    def f(self, num):\n        return 7 * super().f(num)  # Use super() to call the method from the parent class\n\n# Example usage:\nb_instance = B(3)\nresult = b_instance.f(5)\nprint(result)  # This will print 35, which is 7 times the result of A's f method\n```\n\nIn this code, `super().f(num)` calls the `f` method of the parent class `A`, thereby avoiding infinite recursion. The `super()` function is a powerful tool that allows you to call methods from a parent class efficiently."
