I am looking for a solution that could possibly separate between user CPU time, system CPU time, and elapsed time. I know about the `timeit` module but I find it complicated with many self-written functions. I would prefer a solution that enables me to start counting before the block of code and stop counting after the block of code with the times returned."

        "content": "To measure the execution time of a block of code in Python 2.7 and separate between user CPU time, system CPU time, and elapsed time, you can use the `time` and `resource` modules. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieving this:\n\n1. **Elapsed Time**: Use `time.time()` to measure the wall-clock time before and after the code block.\n\n2. **User and System CPU Time**: Use `resource.getrusage()` to get the CPU times before and after the code block.\n\nHere's a complete example:\n\n```python\nimport time\nimport resource\n\n# Start time measurements\nstart_wall_time = time.time()\nstart_resources = resource.getrusage(resource.RUSAGE_SELF)\n\n# Your code block here\n# Example: \nfor i in range(1000000):\n    pass  # Replace this with your actual code\n\n# End time measurements\nend_wall_time = time.time()\nend_resources = resource.getrusage(resource.RUSAGE_SELF)\n\n# Calculate elapsed times\nelapsed_wall_time = end_wall_time - start_wall_time\nelapsed_user_time = end_resources.ru_utime - start_resources.ru_utime\nelapsed_system_time = end_resources.ru_stime - start_resources.ru_stime\n\n# Print results\nprint(\"Elapsed wall-clock time: {:.6f} seconds\".format(elapsed_wall_time))\nprint(\"Elapsed user CPU time: {:.6f} seconds\".format(elapsed_user_time))\nprint(\"Elapsed system CPU time: {:.6f} seconds\".format(elapsed_system_time))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Wall-Clock Time**: This is the real-world time that has passed, as measured by `time.time()`.\n- **User CPU Time**: This is the time spent by the CPU executing user-level instructions, obtained from `ru_utime`.\n- **System CPU Time**: This is the time spent by the CPU executing system-level (kernel) instructions, obtained from `ru_stime`.\n\nThis solution gives you a detailed breakdown of the time spent in your code block, allowing you to understand its performance from different angles."
