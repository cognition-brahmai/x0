I attempted to do this using 'setup' and 'find_packages', but it was unsuccessful. In addition, I found that when I run 'python setup.py install', it excludes 'test' as expected, but when I run 'python setup.py sdist', everything is included contrary to my expectations. Is there a way to exclude 'test' using 'setup' and 'find_packages' without having to rely on the 'MANIFEST.in' file?"

        "content": "To exclude the `test` directory when creating a source distribution with `python setup.py sdist`, you typically need to use a `MANIFEST.in` file, as `find_packages()` primarily controls what gets included in the installation package, not the source distribution. However, if you want to avoid using `MANIFEST.in`, you can try a different approach by using the `find_packages` function more effectively, but note that this may not fully achieve your goal for source distributions without `MANIFEST.in`.\n\nHere's how you can use `find_packages` to exclude the `test` directory as best as possible:\n\n1. **Setup File Configuration:**\n\n   You can use the `exclude` parameter in `find_packages` to ignore certain packages during installation:\n\n   ```python\n   from setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\n   setup(\n       name='your_project_name',\n       version='0.1',\n       packages=find_packages(where='src', exclude=['test', 'test.*']),\n       package_dir={'': 'src'},\n   )\n   ```\n\n   This configuration will help ensure that `test` is excluded from the built package during installation.\n\n2. **Limitation:**\n\n   Unfortunately, `find_packages` does not control what files are included in the source distribution (`sdist`). The `sdist` command, by default, includes all files in the directory. Without a `MANIFEST.in`, `sdist` will include everything.\n\n3. **Alternative Approach:**\n\n   If you must avoid using `MANIFEST.in`, consider switching to using `setuptools`'s support for `setup.cfg` or even `pyproject.toml` for more configuration options and potentially future enhancements in `setuptools`. However, as of the latest versions, excluding directories from `sdist` without `MANIFEST.in` isn't natively supported.\n\n4. **Recommendation:**\n\n   The most straightforward and reliable method is to use a `MANIFEST.in` file:\n\n   ```\n   exclude test/*\n   ```\n\n   This explicitly tells `sdist` to exclude the `test` directory from the source distribution.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can manage package exclusions more effectively during both installation and distribution processes, although complete exclusion of directories from `sdist` remains most reliable with `MANIFEST.in`."
