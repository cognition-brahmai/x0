The algorithms I have found online are for determining the angle between vectors, which doesn't help me find the angles inside the triangle. I tried to implement a method I found on the Wikipedia page and subtracted the values, but the results are not as expected. Here is the Python code I used:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\npoints = np.array([[343.8998, 168.1526], [351.2377, 173.7503], [353.531, 182.72]])\n\nA = points[2] - points[0]\nB = points[1] - points[0]\nC = points[2] - points[1]\n\nfor e1, e2 in ((A, B), (A, C), (B, C)):\n    num = np.dot(e1, e2)\n    denom = np.linalg.norm(e1) * np.linalg.norm(e2)\n    print np.arccos(num/denom) * 180\n```\n\nThis code gives me angles 60.2912487814, 60.0951900475 and 120.386438829. What am I doing wrong?"

        "content": "Let's take a closer look at what you're trying to achieve and how your code is functioning. You want to find the angles inside a triangle given its vertices. It's important to note that the angles you're trying to find are between the sides of the triangle, not directly between the vectors from the same vertex. Here's a detailed breakdown of the approach and corrections needed:\n\n1. **Understanding the Vectors**: \n   - The vectors you have defined (A, B, C) are the differences between the vertices.\n   - \\( A = \\text{points}[2] - \\text{points}[0] \\) is the vector from point A to point C.\n   - \\( B = \\text{points}[1] - \\text{points}[0] \\) is the vector from point A to point B.\n   - \\( C = \\text{points}[2] - \\text{points}[1] \\) is the vector from point B to point C.\n\n2. **Angles in the Triangle**:\n   - To find the angle at vertex A, use the vectors from A to the other two points, which are vectors B and A (in your notation).\n   - To find the angle at vertex B, use vectors C and -B.\n   - To find the angle at vertex C, use vectors A and -C.\n\n3. **Correct Code Implementation**:\n   - Calculate the angle at each vertex using the dot product formula and the arccos function, converting the result to degrees.\n\nHere's the corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\npoints = np.array([[343.8998, 168.1526], [351.2377, 173.7503], [353.531, 182.72]])\n\n# Vectors for sides of the triangle\nAB = points[1] - points[0]\nAC = points[2] - points[0]\nBC = points[2] - points[1]\n\n# Calculating angles\ndef angle_between(v1, v2):\n    num = np.dot(v1, v2)\n    denom = np.linalg.norm(v1) * np.linalg.norm(v2)\n    angle_rad = np.arccos(num / denom)\n    return np.degrees(angle_rad)\n\n# Angle at A\nangle_A = angle_between(AB, AC)\n\n# Angle at B\nangle_B = angle_between(-AB, BC)\n\n# Angle at C\nangle_C = angle_between(-AC, -BC)\n\nprint(\"Angle at A:\", angle_A)\nprint(\"Angle at B:\", angle_B)\nprint(\"Angle at C:\", angle_C)\n```\n\nThis code calculates the angles at each vertex using the correct vectors, and it should give you the correct internal angles of the triangle. The sum of these angles should be very close to 180 degrees, as expected in a triangle."
