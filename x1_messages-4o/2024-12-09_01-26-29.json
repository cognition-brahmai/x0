I also tried saving it with a .jpg extension but the problem persists. Can you help me solve this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with the blank image might be due to how the figures are being handled before saving the plot. When you call `plt.show()`, it displays the plot in an interactive window and might clear the figure, which can result in a blank image being saved afterward.\n\nTo solve this, you should ensure that the `plt.savefig()` function is called before `plt.show()`. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport copy\n\n# Assuming dataStack, tumorStack, and T0 are already defined\n# Example:\n# dataStack = np.random.rand(100, 100)\n# tumorStack = np.random.randint(0, 2, (100, 100))\n# T0 = np.random.rand(100, 100)\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\n\nplt.subplot(121)\nplt.imshow(dataStack, cmap=plt.cm.bone)\nplt.title('Data Stack')\n\nplt.subplot(122)\ny = copy.deepcopy(tumorStack)\ny = np.ma.masked_where(y == 0, y)\n\nplt.imshow(dataStack, cmap=plt.cm.bone)\nplt.imshow(y, cmap=plt.cm.jet_r, interpolation='nearest')\nplt.title('Tumor Overlay')\n\nif T0 is not None:\n    plt.figure()\n    plt.imshow(T0, cmap=plt.cm.bone)\n    plt.title('T0 Image')\n\n# Save the figure before plt.show()\nplt.savefig('tessstttyyy.png', dpi=100)\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nHere are a few additional tips to ensure your plots save correctly:\n\n1. **Order of Operations**: Make sure `plt.savefig()` is called before `plt.show()`.\n\n2. **Figure Management**: If you're creating multiple figures, ensure that you're saving the correct figure. You can control this using `plt.figure()` to create and switch between different figures.\n\n3. **Check File Path**: Ensure that the file path provided in `plt.savefig()` is correct and that your program has write permissions to that location.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to save your plots correctly. Let me know if you encounter any other issues!"
