Here's a step-by-step guide to creating a gluten-free recipe that includes at least two types of biscuits with different textures:\n\n### Recipe: Gluten-Free Biscuit Dessert\n\n#### Ingredients:\n\n1. **Crunchy Biscuit Base:**\n   - 1 cup gluten-free digestive biscuits (crushed)\n   - 2 tablespoons melted butter\n\n2. **Soft Biscuit Layer:**\n   - 1 cup gluten-free shortbread biscuits (crumbled)\n   - 2 tablespoons coconut oil (melted)\n\n3. **Creamy Layer:**\n   - 1 cup cream cheese (softened)\n   - 1/4 cup powdered sugar\n   - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n\n4. **Fruit Topping:**\n   - 1 cup mixed berries (fresh or frozen)\n   - 1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup\n\n#### Instructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the Crunchy Biscuit Base:**\n   - Crush the gluten-free digestive biscuits into fine crumbs using a food processor or by placing them in a ziplock bag and crushing with a rolling pin.\n   - In a mixing bowl, combine the crushed biscuits with melted butter. Mix until the crumbs are well-coated.\n   - Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of a baking dish to form an even layer.\n   - Refrigerate the base for about 15 minutes to set.\n\n2. **Create the Soft Biscuit Layer:**\n   - Crumble the gluten-free shortbread biscuits into smaller pieces.\n   - In a separate bowl, mix the crumbled shortbread with melted coconut oil until combined.\n   - Gently spread the soft biscuit mixture over the crunchy base layer.\n\n3. **Prepare the Creamy Layer:**\n   - In a mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese until smooth.\n   - Add powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Mix well until the ingredients are fully incorporated and the mixture is creamy.\n   - Spread the creamy layer evenly over the soft biscuit layer.\n\n4. **Add the Fruit Topping:**\n   - In a small saucepan, heat the mixed berries with honey or maple syrup over medium heat. Stir occasionally until the berries are softened and the mixture is slightly thickened.\n   - Let the berry topping cool slightly, then spread it over the creamy layer.\n\n5. **Chill and Serve:**\n   - Refrigerate the assembled dessert for at least 2 hours to allow the layers to set.\n   - Once set, slice into squares or preferred shapes and serve chilled.\n\nEnjoy your delicious gluten-free dessert that beautifully combines the crunchy and soft textures of different biscuits!"
