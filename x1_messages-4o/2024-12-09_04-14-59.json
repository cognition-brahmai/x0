Open your Python interpreter and run:\n\n   ```python\n   import flask\n   print(flask.__version__)\n   ```\n\n   This will print the version number of the installed Flask package.\n\n3. **Using pip:**\n   You can also use `pip` to check the installed version. Run the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip show flask\n   ```\n\n   This command will provide detailed information about the Flask package, including its version.\n\nThese methods will help you easily determine which version of Flask is installed on your system."
