I am currently using Python 2.5 and Django. Here is my current approach:\n\n```python\ndef only_roman_chars(s):\n    try:\n        s.encode(\"iso-8859-1\")\n        return True\n    except UnicodeDecodeError:\n        return False\n```\n\nIs this the most optimal way to achieve this?"

        "content": "Using `iso-8859-1` encoding to filter characters is a reasonable approach for the Roman alphabet and some common European characters, but it might not be the most optimal or clear way to achieve your goal. Here's why and an alternative approach:\n\n### Why `iso-8859-1` Might Not Be Ideal:\n- **Limited Coverage**: `iso-8859-1` (also known as Latin-1) covers many Western European characters, but it might not include all of the specific characters you want (e.g., some characters like \u00df may be in `iso-8859-1`, but others might not be in your desired set).\n- **Clarity**: Using encoding as a filter can be less clear than explicitly defining the set of allowed characters.\n\n### Alternative Approach:\nA more explicit and clear method would involve defining a set of allowed characters and checking against it. Here's an example of how you might implement this using regular expressions in Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef only_roman_chars(s):\n    # Define the allowed characters (Roman alphabet + specific European characters)\n    allowed_chars = re.compile(u'^[a-zA-Z\u00df\u00fc\u00f8\u00e9\u00e0\u00ee]+$', re.UNICODE)\n    \n    # Check if the string matches the allowed characters\n    return bool(allowed_chars.match(s))\n\n# Example Usage\nprint(only_roman_chars(\"Hello\"))  # True\nprint(only_roman_chars(\"H\u00e9llo\"))  # True\nprint(only_roman_chars(\"\u4f60\u597d\"))    # False\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Regular Expression**: The regular expression `^[a-zA-Z\u00df\u00fc\u00f8\u00e9\u00e0\u00ee]+$` checks if the entire string consists only of the specified characters. You can adjust this set to include any additional characters you want to allow.\n- **Unicode Flag**: The `re.UNICODE` flag ensures that the regex engine treats the pattern and input string as Unicode.\n\nThis method is more maintainable and clear, as it explicitly states which characters are allowed. You can easily modify the character set if needed, and it's clear to anyone reading the code what the constraints are."
