One approach is to use an excel table to track your investments and ensure that they are evenly distributed across different sectors and asset classes.\nHere is an example excel table that you can use to create a balanced portfolio:\n| Company | Ticker | Sector | Price | Shares | Total Value |\n|---------|--------|--------|-------|--------|-------------|\n| Apple   | AAPL   | Tech   | $145  | 50     | $7,250      |\n| Amazon  | AMZN   | Retail | $3,225| 10     | $32,250     |\n| JPMorgan| JPM    | Finance| $155  | 30     | $4,650      |\n| CocaCola| KO     | FMCG   | $55   | 100    | $5,500      |\n| Total   |        |        |       |        | $49,650     |\nIn this example, the portfolio is well-diversified across different sectors, with 25% invested in technology, 65% in retail, and 10% in finance and FMCG. The portfolio also has a total value of $49,650, with each investment contributing to the overall balance.\nBy regularly updating and monitoring your excel table, you can ensure that your portfolio remains balanced and aligned with your investment objectives."
