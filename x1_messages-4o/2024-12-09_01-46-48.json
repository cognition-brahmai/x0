I can list the contents of the directory with the `s3cmd` command, but when I try to connect to the S3 bucket using Python boto with the command `bucket = conn.get_bucket('bucket-name')`, I encounter the error `boto.exception.S3ResponseError: S3ResponseError: 403 Forbidden`. Furthermore, when I try to specify the directory in the bucket with the command `bucket = conn.get_bucket('bucket-name/dir-in-bucket')`, the script stalls for about 10 seconds and then prints out an error. The full trace of the error is provided below. I am specifically using the boto version 2 module, not boto3. How can I solve this issue and successfully connect to the S3 bucket?\n\nError Trace:\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"test_s3.py\", line 7, in <module>\n    bucket = conn.get_bucket('bucket-name/dir-name')\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/boto/s3/connection.py\", line 471, in get_bucket\n    return self.head_bucket(bucket_name, headers=headers)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/boto/s3/connection.py\", line 490, in head_bucket\n    response = self.make_request('HEAD', bucket_name, headers=headers)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/boto/s3/connection.py\", line 633, in make_request\n    retry_handler=retry_handler\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/boto/connection.py\", line 1046, in make_request\n    retry_handler=retry_handler)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/boto/connection.py\", line 922, in _mexe\n    request.body, request.headers)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/httplib.py\", line 958, in request\n    self._send_request(method, url, body, headers)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/httplib.py\", line 992, in _send_request\n    self.endheaders(body)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/httplib.py\", line 954, in endheaders\n    self._send_output(message_body)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/httplib.py\", line 814, in _send_output\n    self.send(msg)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/httplib.py\", line 776, in send\n    self.connect()\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/httplib.py\", line 1157, in connect\n    self.timeout, self.source_address)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/socket.py\", line 553, in create_connection\n    for res in getaddrinfo(host, port, 0, SOCK_STREAM):\nsocket.gaierror: [Errno -2] Name or service not known\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is a common issue when dealing with AWS S3 buckets using the boto library. Here are some steps and considerations to troubleshoot and solve the problem:\n\n1. **Check Your Credentials**:\n   - Ensure that the AWS credentials you are using (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) have the necessary permissions to access the bucket. Double-check the `~/.aws/credentials` file or wherever you have stored your credentials.\n\n2. **Correct Bucket Name**:\n   - The command `bucket = conn.get_bucket('bucket-name')` should only include the bucket name, not the directory path within the bucket. S3 does not support directories in the traditional sense; they are a part of the object key.\n\n3. **Bucket Permissions**:\n   - Verify that your IAM user or role has the required permissions for the bucket. You may need to have permissions like `s3:ListBucket`, `s3:GetObject`, etc.\n\n4. **Region Specification**:\n   - Make sure you are connecting to the correct region. You can specify the region by modifying the connection:\n\n     ```python\n     from boto.s3.connection import S3Connection\n     conn = S3Connection('<access_key>', '<secret_key>', host='s3.<region>.amazonaws.com')\n     ```\n\n5. **Network and DNS Issues**:\n   - The error `socket.gaierror: [Errno -2] Name or service not known` suggests there might be a DNS resolution issue. Check your network settings and ensure that your server or machine can resolve AWS endpoints. You might try using a different DNS server or checking your network configuration.\n\n6. **Ensure Boto is Properly Installed**:\n   - Confirm that you have the correct version of boto installed and there are no conflicts. Consider reinstalling boto with:\n\n     ```bash\n     pip install boto --upgrade\n     ```\n\n7. **Debugging with Logs**:\n   - Enable boto logs for detailed debugging information by setting the environment variable `BOTO_LOG_LEVEL` to `debug`:\n\n     ```bash\n     export BOTO_LOG_LEVEL=debug\n     ```\n\n8. **Use Alternative Methods to List Objects**:\n   - If you can list objects using `s3cmd`, try using boto's `list` method to list the contents of the bucket:\n\n     ```python\n     bucket = conn.get_bucket('bucket-name')\n     for key in bucket.list(prefix='dir-in-bucket/'):\n         print(key.name)\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to address the issues and successfully connect to and interact with your S3 bucket using boto. If problems persist, reviewing AWS CloudTrail logs for any denied actions or errors related to S3 access might provide additional insights."
