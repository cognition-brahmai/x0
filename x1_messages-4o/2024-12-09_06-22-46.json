I've been following the instructions on Nvidia's website (section: Getting Started with FFmpeg/libav using NVIDIA GPUs). I've configured it with the following options: `--enable-nonfree --disable-shared --enable-nvenc --enable-cuda --enable-cuvid --enable-libnpp --extra-cflags=-Ilocal/include --extra-cflags=-I../common/inc --extra-ldflags=-L../common/lib/x64 --prefix=ffmpeg`. However, I've hit a snag and I'm getting the error: \"libnpp not found.\" The common folder has been downloaded from NVIDIA Video Codec SDK but there are no npp libs or header files present in it. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "Compiling FFmpeg with NVIDIA hardware acceleration can be tricky, especially when dealing with the NVIDIA Performance Primitives (NPP) library. Here are some steps and tips that might help you resolve the \"libnpp not found\" error:\n\n1. **Verify NVIDIA SDK and Toolkit Installation:**\n   - Ensure you have the correct version of the CUDA Toolkit installed. The NPP library is part of the CUDA Toolkit, not specifically the Video Codec SDK.\n   - Check the installation directory of the CUDA Toolkit (e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\\CUDA\\vX.X` where `vX.X` is your CUDA version) to verify that the NPP libraries and headers are present. Look in the `lib/x64` and `include` directories for `npp*` files.\n\n2. **Set Environment Variables:**\n   - Make sure your environment variables are properly set to point to the CUDA Toolkit directories. This includes adding the `bin` and `lib/x64` directories to your `PATH`, and setting `CUDA_HOME` to the root of your CUDA Toolkit installation.\n\n3. **Modify Configure Command:**\n   - Ensure your `--extra-cflags` and `--extra-ldflags` point to the correct directories within the CUDA Toolkit. For example:\n     ```\n     --extra-cflags=-IC:/Program Files/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/vX.X/include\n     --extra-ldflags=-LC:/Program Files/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/vX.X/lib/x64\n     ```\n\n4. **Check Specific NPP Libraries:**\n   - Depending on your CUDA version, you might need to specify particular NPP libraries. You can do this by adding them to `--extra-ldflags`. For example:\n     ```\n     --extra-ldflags=-lnppc -lnppial -lnppicc -lnppidei -lnppif -lnppig -lnppim -lnppist -lnppisu -lnppitc\n     ```\n\n5. **Verify CUDA Toolkit Version Compatibility:**\n   - Ensure that the CUDA Toolkit version you are using is compatible with the FFmpeg version you're compiling. Sometimes, certain FFmpeg versions require specific CUDA Toolkit versions.\n\n6. **Check for MinGW/MSYS Compatibility:**\n   - Ensure that your MinGW/MSYS setup is compatible with the paths and tools you're using. Sometimes, issues with path formats can cause libraries not to be found.\n\n7. **Download and Link NPP Separately:**\n   - If for some reason the NPP libraries are missing from your CUDA Toolkit installation, you might need to download them separately from NVIDIA's website or reinstall the CUDA Toolkit.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the \"libnpp not found\" error and successfully compile FFmpeg with NVIDIA hardware acceleration support on Windows using MinGW/MSYS. If you continue to face issues, consider checking NVIDIA and FFmpeg forums for assistance, as other users may have encountered similar problems."
