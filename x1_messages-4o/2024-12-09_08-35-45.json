        "content": "In Python, there are some differences in performance and memory usage when using `from X import method1, method2` versus `import X`, but they are generally minor and not usually a concern unless you are working in a very resource-constrained environment.\n\n1. **`from X import method1, method2`:**\n   - **Performance:** This approach might be slightly faster when accessing `method1` and `method2` because you can use them directly without the need to reference the module name each time (e.g., `method1()` instead of `X.method1()`). This minor reduction in attribute lookup time can offer a tiny performance boost.\n   - **Memory Usage:** Only the specified methods (`method1` and `method2`) are imported into the local namespace, but the entire module `X` is still loaded into memory. The namespace is just populated with only the selected methods, but the memory usage is essentially the same for the loaded module.\n\n2. **`import X`:**\n   - **Performance:** Accessing methods requires prefixing them with the module name (e.g., `X.method1()`), which involves an additional attribute lookup. This can be slightly slower than using the methods directly, but the difference is usually negligible.\n   - **Memory Usage:** The entire module is loaded into memory and available under the module namespace. This doesn't consume more memory compared to `from X import method1, method2`, as the module is loaded into memory in both cases.\n\nIn most cases, the choice between the two should be based on readability and maintainability of the code rather than performance or memory usage. If you're using just a couple of methods, `from X import method1, method2` can make the code cleaner and more readable. However, if you need many components from the module or want to keep the module's namespace intact to avoid potential name conflicts, `import X` might be preferable."
