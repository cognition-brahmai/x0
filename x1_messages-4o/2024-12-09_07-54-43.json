For instance, the following input creates an error:\n```\n-d C:\\SMTHNG\\Name with spaces\\MORE\\file.csv\n```\nThe error message I receive is:\n```\nerror: unrecognized arguments: with spaces\\MORE\\file.csv\n```\nIt appears that the flag only takes in 'C:\\SMTHNG\\Name' as input. How can I solve this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing arises because spaces in file paths are interpreted as argument separators by the command line. To handle spaces in file paths when using `argparse` in Python, you have two primary options:\n\n1. **Quote the File Path**: When you provide the file path as an argument, you can wrap it in quotes to ensure it's treated as a single argument. This can be done using either single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`\"`), like so:\n\n   ```shell\n   -d \"C:\\SMTHNG\\Name with spaces\\MORE\\file.csv\"\n   ```\n\n   or\n\n   ```shell\n   -d 'C:\\SMTHNG\\Name with spaces\\MORE\\file.csv'\n   ```\n\n2. **Escape Spaces**: Alternatively, you can escape spaces in the file path using a backslash (`\\`). This method is less common on Windows but is an option on Unix-like systems. Here is how it would look:\n\n   ```shell\n   -d C:\\SMTHNG\\Name\\ with\\ spaces\\MORE\\file.csv\n   ```\n\nHowever, quoting is generally the more straightforward and preferred method, especially on Windows.\n\nAdditionally, ensure your script is handling the input correctly by printing or logging the received path to verify it's being interpreted as expected. Here's a simple example of how you might implement and test this in your script:\n\n```python\nimport argparse\n\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=\"Process a file path.\")\nparser.add_argument(\"-d\", \"--dmp\", default=None, help=\"Path to the file\")\n\nargs = parser.parse_args()\n\nif args.dmp:\n    print(f\"File path received: {args.dmp}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No file path provided.\")\n```\n\nWhen running your script, test it with quoted file paths to see if it resolves the issue."
