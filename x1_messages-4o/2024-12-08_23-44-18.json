        "content": "To handle arrays with duplicate elements using binary search in Go, we can modify the existing `binarySearch` function to find the first occurrence of the target element. This involves tweaking the logic slightly to ensure that if a match is found, we continue to search in the left half to see if there is an earlier occurrence of the same element.\n\nHere's how you can modify the code to achieve that:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\n// Function to find the first occurrence of an element\nfunc binarySearchFirstOccurrence(arr []int, left int, right int, x int) int {\n    result := -1\n    for left <= right {\n        mid := left + (right-left)/2\n        if arr[mid] == x {\n            result = mid\n            right = mid - 1 // Continue searching in the left half\n        } else if arr[mid] < x {\n            left = mid + 1\n        } else {\n            right = mid - 1\n        }\n    }\n    return result\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    arr := []int{2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 14, 14, 17, 20}\n    n := len(arr)\n    x := 14\n    result := binarySearchFirstOccurrence(arr, 0, n-1, x)\n    if result == -1 {\n        fmt.Println(\"Element not present\")\n    } else {\n        fmt.Println(\"Element first found at index\", result)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We introduced a variable `result` which stores the index of the first occurrence of the target element `x`.\n- If the element at `mid` is equal to `x`, we update `result` and continue to search in the left half by setting `right = mid - 1` to find the first occurrence.\n- If `arr[mid]` is less than `x`, we search in the right half by setting `left = mid + 1`.\n- If `arr[mid]` is more than `x`, we search in the left half by setting `right = mid - 1`.\n\nThis modified function will find the first occurrence of the target element in the array, even if there are duplicates."
