However, when I run the following code:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nb = [object(), object()]\n\nprint(random.shuffle(b))\n```\n\nI get `None` as output. What am I doing wrong?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is because the `random.shuffle()` function shuffles the list in place and returns `None`. It doesn't return a new list but modifies the original list directly. That's why when you try to print the result of `random.shuffle(b)`, you get `None`.\n\nTo shuffle the list and see the result, you should shuffle the list first and then print it:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nb = [object(), object()]\n\nrandom.shuffle(b)  # This shuffles the list in place\nprint(b)  # Now print the shuffled list\n```\n\nIn this code, `random.shuffle(b)` shuffles the list `b`, and then `print(b)` displays the shuffled list."
