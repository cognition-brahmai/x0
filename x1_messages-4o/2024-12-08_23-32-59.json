The table has columns named \"id\", \"text\", and \"zip_code\". Your task is to use your skills in SQL and logic to identify the street names and zip codes by searching for keywords like \"street\", \"avenue\", \"road\", and \"zip code\" within the text column. The solution should provide a list of street names and their respective zip codes. Good luck!"

        "content": "Certainly! To solve this puzzle, we will need to construct an SQL query that searches for keywords such as \"street\", \"avenue\", \"road\", and \"zip code\" in the \"text\" column of the \"address_info\" table. We will then extract the relevant street names and zip codes.\n\nHere is a step-by-step SQL solution:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Patterns**: We need to locate patterns that represent street names and zip codes. Common keywords are \"street\", \"avenue\", \"road\", etc., followed by a proper noun or number. Zip codes are usually numeric patterns.\n\n2. **SQL Query Construction**: We will use a combination of SQL functions such as `LIKE`, `SUBSTRING`, and possibly regex if the database supports it, to extract the desired information.\n\nHere's a sample SQL query that might help:\n\n```sql\nSELECT id, \n       SUBSTRING(text, \n                 CHARINDEX('street', LOWER(text)) - 100, \n                 200) AS street_name, \n       SUBSTRING(text, \n                 PATINDEX('%[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]%', text), \n                 5) AS zip_code\nFROM address_info\nWHERE LOWER(text) LIKE '%street%'\n   OR LOWER(text) LIKE '%avenue%'\n   OR LOWER(text) LIKE '%road%'\n   OR LOWER(text) LIKE '%zip code%';\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`CHARINDEX`**: This function is used to find the starting position of the keyword \"street\" in the text. A similar approach can be applied for \"avenue\", \"road\", or other relevant keywords.\n  \n- **`SUBSTRING`**: Extracts a portion of the text around the identified keyword. The numbers `-100` and `200` are arbitrary and can be adjusted based on expected text length around keywords.\n\n- **`PATINDEX`**: Finds the position of a five-digit number which is assumed to be the zip code.\n\n### Important Considerations:\n\n- **Database Support**: Ensure that the database supports the functions used. Some databases might offer regex functions which could be more efficient.\n  \n- **Data Variability**: The structure of the text data might vary significantly, so the query may need to be adjusted based on the actual data content.\n\n- **Validation**: After extracting, validate the results to ensure accuracy. This may involve additional steps if the data is particularly unstructured.\n\nThis query provides a starting point, and you may need to refine it based on the specifics of your data and database capabilities."
