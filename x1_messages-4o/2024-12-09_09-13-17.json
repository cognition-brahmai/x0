        "content": "Certainly! Below is a simple shell script that calculates and displays the sum of the first 10 natural numbers:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Initialize variables\nsum=0\n\n# Loop through the first 10 natural numbers\nfor (( i=1; i<=10; i++ ))\ndo\n  # Add the current number to the sum\n  sum=$((sum + i))\ndone\n\n# Display the sum\necho \"The sum of the first 10 natural numbers is: $sum\"\n```\n\n### How It Works:\n- The script initializes a variable `sum` to 0.\n- It then uses a `for` loop to iterate through numbers 1 to 10.\n- In each iteration, it adds the current number (`i`) to `sum`.\n- After the loop completes, it displays the total sum.\n\nTo run this script:\n1. Save it to a file, for example `sum.sh`.\n2. Make the script executable by running `chmod +x sum.sh` in the terminal.\n3. Execute the script by running `./sum.sh`. \n\nYou should see the output: `The sum of the first 10 natural numbers is: 55`."
