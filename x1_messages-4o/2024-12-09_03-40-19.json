        "content": "When you're running tests with `pytest`, it can be useful to know whether your code is executing in a test environment so that you can, for instance, connect to a different database. There are a few strategies you can use to detect when your code is running under a `pytest` session:\n\n1. **Environment Variable**: You can set an environment variable when running your tests and check for it in your code. For example, you can set an environment variable `PYTEST_RUNNING` to `1` when running `pytest` and check for it in your application code.\n\n   In your test setup or command line:\n   ```bash\n   PYTEST_RUNNING=1 pytest\n   ```\n\n   In your application code:\n   ```python\n   import os\n\n   if os.getenv('PYTEST_RUNNING') == '1':\n       # Connect to test database\n   else:\n       # Connect to production database\n   ```\n\n2. **Pytest Plugin**: Use the `pytest` configuration or hook system to set a flag or use a marker. This is a bit more advanced and may be overkill for simple cases.\n\n3. **Checking for Pytest Modules**: You could check if `pytest` is imported, though this is less reliable and not recommended for robust applications.\n\n   ```python\n   def is_running_under_pytest():\n       try:\n           import pytest\n           return True\n       except ImportError:\n           return False\n\n   if is_running_under_pytest():\n       # Connect to test database\n   else:\n       # Connect to production database\n   ```\n\n4. **Command-Line Options**: You can also use pytest command-line options to pass a parameter to your tests and read that parameter in your code.\n\n   In your test run command:\n   ```bash\n   pytest --test-environment\n   ```\n\n   In your `conftest.py`:\n   ```python\n   def pytest_addoption(parser):\n       parser.addoption(\"--test-environment\", action=\"store_true\", help=\"use test database\")\n\n   def pytest_configure(config):\n       if config.getoption(\"--test-environment\"):\n           os.environ['TEST_ENV'] = '1'\n   ```\n\n   In your application code:\n   ```python\n   import os\n\n   if os.getenv('TEST_ENV') == '1':\n       # Connect to test database\n   else:\n       # Connect to production database\n   ```\n\nChoose the strategy that best aligns with your project's requirements and complexity. The environment variable approach is often the simplest and most effective for many cases."
