I am currently using the 'which' parameter in the grid properties to define both major and minor gridlines with the same linestyle. Is there a way to specify a different linestyle for minor gridlines only? Here is the code I'm currently using:\n\n```python\nplt.plot(current, counts, 'rd', markersize=8)\nplt.yscale('log')\nplt.grid(b=True, which='both', color='0.65', linestyle='-')\n```"

        "content": "Yes, you can specify different styles for major and minor gridlines in Matplotlib by calling the `grid` method separately for each. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve solid black major gridlines and grey dashed minor gridlines:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Example data\ncurrent = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5])\ncounts = np.array([10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000])\n\nplt.plot(current, counts, 'rd', markersize=8)\nplt.yscale('log')\n\n# Set major gridlines\nplt.grid(b=True, which='major', color='black', linestyle='-')\n\n# Set minor gridlines\nplt.minorticks_on()  # Enable minor ticks\nplt.grid(b=True, which='minor', color='grey', linestyle='--')\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what this code does:\n\n- `plt.grid(b=True, which='major', color='black', linestyle='-')`: This sets the major gridlines to be solid and black.\n- `plt.minorticks_on()`: This enables minor ticks on the axes, which is necessary for minor gridlines to appear.\n- `plt.grid(b=True, which='minor', color='grey', linestyle='--')`: This sets the minor gridlines to be grey and dashed.\n\nBy calling `plt.grid()` separately for major and minor gridlines, you can customize them independently."
