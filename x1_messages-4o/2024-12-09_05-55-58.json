        "content": "Yes, Python's default list sorter does sort a list of tuples by the first element in each tuple. When you use the `sort()` method on a list of tuples, Python sorts the tuples based on the first element. If the first elements are equal, it then considers the second element, and so on, just like it does for sorting strings or other sequences.\n\nHere's a simple example to illustrate this:\n\n```python\n# List of tuples\ntuples_list = [(3, 'banana'), (1, 'apple'), (2, 'pear'), (1, 'orange')]\n\n# Sorting the list of tuples\ntuples_list.sort()\n\nprint(tuples_list)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n[(1, 'apple'), (1, 'orange'), (2, 'pear'), (3, 'banana')]\n```\n\nIn this example, the list of tuples is sorted primarily by the first element in each tuple. \n\nIf you want to sort the list of tuples by the first element explicitly, you don't need to do anything extra because that's the default behavior. However, you can specify a `key` function if you want to make it more explicit or if you need to sort by another element. Here\u2019s how you could do that:\n\n```python\n# Sorting explicitly by the first element\ntuples_list.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n\nprint(tuples_list)\n```\n\nThis will yield the same result as above. The `key` parameter is useful when you need to sort by a different element, such as the second element or a combination of elements."
