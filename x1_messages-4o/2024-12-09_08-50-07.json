        "content": "To retrieve both the \"title\" and \"description\" columns from a table in MySQL, you can use the SELECT statement. Here's the basic syntax for the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT title, description FROM your_table_name;\n```\n\nReplace `your_table_name` with the actual name of your table. This query will return all the rows from the table, displaying the data from the \"title\" and \"description\" columns. If you want to add conditions to filter the results, you can use the WHERE clause. For example:\n\n```sql\nSELECT title, description FROM your_table_name WHERE some_column = some_value;\n```\n\nThis will give you the \"title\" and \"description\" for rows where `some_column` matches `some_value`."
