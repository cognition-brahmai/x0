You can do this using an f-string (formatted string literal) in Python. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\n# Assume TotalAmount is defined with some value\nTotalAmount = \"100.00\"\n\n# Open the file in write mode\nwith open(\"Output.txt\", \"w\") as text_file:\n    # Use an f-string to include the value of TotalAmount in the string\n    text_file.write(f\"Purchase Amount: {TotalAmount}\")\n\n# The file is automatically closed after the with block\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- We use `with open(...) as ...` to handle file operations, which automatically closes the file after the block.\n- We use an f-string (`f\"...\"`) to insert the value of `TotalAmount` into the string. The expression `{TotalAmount}` inside the f-string is replaced with the value of the `TotalAmount` variable. \n\nThis should write the correct `Purchase Amount: 100.00` (or whatever value `TotalAmount` holds) to `Output.txt`."
