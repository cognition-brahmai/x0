I believe I've installed everything correctly with the CUDA toolkit as I can compile my samples, but I'm confused about whether I need to install the CUDA SDK as well. Is there any difference between these two? Also, I'm not sure if the CUDA 6 is running for my 9 series card. Here is my nvcc version:\n\n```\nnvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver\nCopyright (c) 2005-2014 NVIDIA Corporation\nBuilt on Wed_Aug_27_10:36:36_CDT_2014\nCuda compilation tools, release 6.5, V6.5.16\n```\n\nFurthermore, I'm trying to include `<cutil.h>` in my code as per a book I'm following, but I can't find that file anywhere in the includes. I've followed the guide provided by NVIDIA (http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/6_5/rel/docs/CUDA_Getting_Started_Linux.pdf) and since I've done what they say, I'm not sure why I'm encountering this issue. Could you provide some guidance?"

        "content": "To address your concerns regarding CUDA installation and usage on Ubuntu 14.04 for your Maxwell card, let's break down the different components and issues you're facing:\n\n1. **CUDA Toolkit vs. CUDA SDK**: \n   - The CUDA Toolkit includes all the necessary tools, libraries, and compiler needed for developing with CUDA. This includes `nvcc`, the CUDA compiler, libraries such as cuBLAS, cuFFT, and others.\n   - The term \"CUDA SDK\" is often used interchangeably with the CUDA Toolkit, but it traditionally referred to additional sample codes and examples provided by NVIDIA to help developers get started. These are now typically included with the CUDA Toolkit under the \"samples\" directory.\n\n2. **CUDA Support for Maxwell Cards**: \n   - CUDA 6.5 supports Maxwell architecture (Compute Capability 5.0) which includes GTX 9** series cards. If your samples are compiling and running, your setup is likely functioning correctly.\n   - To verify that your card is being detected and CUDA is working, you can run the `deviceQuery` sample. It will show the properties of the CUDA-capable devices detected on your system.\n\n3. **Missing `<cutil.h>`**:\n   - The `cutil.h` header and its associated libraries were part of older CUDA SDKs as utility functions to simplify some common tasks. However, they have been deprecated and removed in later versions, starting around CUDA 5.0.\n   - If your book refers to `cutil.h`, it's likely using an older codebase. You can either find an older version of the CUDA SDK that includes these utilities, or update the code to use newer alternatives. Most of the functionality provided by `cutil.h` can be replaced with standard C++ or CUDA runtime functions.\n\n4. **General Recommendations**:\n   - Ensure that your `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables are set correctly to include the CUDA Toolkit paths. This is crucial for compiling and running CUDA applications.\n   - Consider upgrading your Ubuntu version to a more recent release if possible, as Ubuntu 14.04 is quite old and may have compatibility issues with newer software and libraries.\n\n5. **Additional Resources**:\n   - Check the NVIDIA Developer forums for any specific issues others might have encountered with similar setups.\n   - Look into the sample codes provided with the CUDA Toolkit for examples on how to structure your CUDA projects without relying on deprecated utilities.\n\nBy addressing these points, you should be able to resolve the issues you're encountering with your CUDA setup on Ubuntu 14.04."
