        "content": "Selecting the two most influential people of the twentieth century based on their impact on global economic policies and their contributions to technological advancement is a challenging task, given the numerous impactful figures in these fields. However, two individuals who stand out due to their significant contributions are:\n\n1. **John Maynard Keynes**: Keynes was a British economist whose ideas fundamentally changed the theory and practice of macroeconomics and the economic policies of governments. He is best known for his work during the Great Depression, advocating for government intervention to mitigate economic recessions and depressions. His ideas gave rise to Keynesian economics, which influenced economic policies globally, especially in the mid-20th century, helping to shape modern economic theory and fiscal policy.\n\n2. **Alan Turing**: Turing was a mathematician and computer scientist whose work laid the foundational concepts for modern computing and artificial intelligence. His development of the Turing machine provided the basis for the theory of computation, and his work on breaking the Enigma code during World War II had a profound impact on the war's outcome. Turing's contributions to computer science have had lasting effects on technological advancement and innovation throughout the century and beyond.\n\nBoth individuals left an indelible mark on their respective fields and continue to influence economic and technological landscapes today."
