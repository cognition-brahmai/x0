        "content": "I am working with Python and I have a function named `splitNet()` that parses a file into a list. Inside the function, I open a file and read lines from it, replace \"\\r\\n\" in each line, split the line by comma and convert the split items to integers. I store these integers in a list called 'network' and return this list. However, when I try to print the 'network' list outside of the function for debugging purposes, I encounter a `NameError` indicating that 'network' is not defined. Is there something I am doing wrong? Is there a better way to pass variables between functions without using global variables? Here is my code:\n\n```python\ndef splitNet():\n    network = []\n    for line in open(\"/home/tom/Dropbox/CN/Python/CW2/network.txt\",\"r\").readlines():\n        line = line.replace(\"\\r\\n\", \"\")\n        line = string.split(line, ',')\n        line = map(int, line)\n        network.append(line)\n    return network\n```\n\nI get the following error when I try to print the list:\n```python\nNameError: name 'network' is not defined\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that you're trying to access the `network` list outside of the `splitNet()` function without actually calling the function to get its returned value. In Python, variables defined within a function are local to that function and cannot be accessed outside of it unless returned. Here's how you can properly use the function to get the `network` list and print it:\n\n1. Call the `splitNet()` function and store its returned value in a variable.\n2. Print the variable that stores the returned list.\n\nHere's an example of how to do this:\n\n```python\ndef splitNet():\n    network = []\n    for line in open(\"/home/tom/Dropbox/CN/Python/CW2/network.txt\", \"r\").readlines():\n        line = line.replace(\"\\r\\n\", \"\")\n        line = line.split(',')  # Use str.split() instead of string.split()\n        line = map(int, line)\n        network.append(list(line))  # Convert map object to list\n    return network\n\n# Call the function and store the result in a variable\nnetwork = splitNet()\n\n# Print the returned list\nprint(network)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- Use `str.split()` instead of `string.split()`. The `string` module does not have a `split` method.\n- Convert the `map` object to a list using `list(map(...))` before appending it to the `network` list. In Python 3, `map` returns an iterator, which needs to be converted to a list.\n- Make sure to call the function and store its result in a variable before attempting to print it. This variable is what you should print to see the contents of `network`."
