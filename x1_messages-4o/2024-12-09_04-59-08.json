If the list is [['a','b'], ['a','c'], ['b','d']], I can search for a pair easily by doing ['a','b'] in list. Now, is there a way to check if a pair exists in which a specific string is present in only the second position without using a for loop? I don't need to know the index or keep the loop going after it's found."

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this by using the `any()` function along with a generator expression. The `any()` function will return `True` as soon as it finds a match, without needing to loop through the entire list. Here's how you can check if a specific string is present in only the second position of any pair:\n\n```python\npairs = [['a', 'b'], ['a', 'c'], ['b', 'd']]\n\n# Let's say you want to check if there is a pair with 'c' in the second position\ntarget = 'c'\n\n# Use any() with a generator expression\nexists = any(pair[1] == target for pair in pairs)\n\nprint(exists)  # This will print True if such a pair exists, otherwise False\n```\n\nIn this example, `any(pair[1] == target for pair in pairs)` will evaluate to `True` as soon as it finds a pair where the second element is 'c', and it will stop checking further."
