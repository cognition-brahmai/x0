Has this been considered?"

        "content": "Yes, Python has built-in support for asynchronous programming, primarily through the `asyncio` library, which is part of the Python standard library. `asyncio` allows you to run asynchronous code using `async` and `await`, and manage asynchronous tasks with event loops.\n\nHere's how you can use `asyncio` to achieve something similar to what you've described:\n\n### Asynchronous Method Calls with `asyncio`\n\nYou can define an asynchronous function using `async def`, and use `await` to call other asynchronous functions. Here's a basic example:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def longComputation():\n    # Simulate a long computation or I/O-bound operation\n    await asyncio.sleep(2)\n    return \"Computation Result\"\n\nasync def main():\n    # Schedule longComputation to be run\n    task = asyncio.create_task(longComputation())\n\n    # Alternative, polling\n    while not task.done():\n        print(\"Doing something else...\")\n        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)  # Simulate doing other work\n\n    result = await task  # Get the result of the computation\n    print(f\"Computation finished with result: {result}\")\n\n# Run the main function\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n### Wrapping Non-Async Code\n\nIf you have a synchronous function and want to run it asynchronously, you can use `loop.run_in_executor()` to run it in a separate thread or process. Here\u2019s an example:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport time\nfrom concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor\n\ndef longComputation():\n    # Simulate a long computation (blocking)\n    time.sleep(2)\n    return \"Computation Result\"\n\nasync def main():\n    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()\n\n    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:\n        # Schedule longComputation to run in a separate thread\n        task = loop.run_in_executor(executor, longComputation)\n\n        # Alternative, polling\n        while not task.done():\n            print(\"Doing something else...\")\n            await asyncio.sleep(0.5)  # Simulate doing other work\n\n        result = await task  # Get the result of the computation\n        print(f\"Computation finished with result: {result}\")\n\n# Run the main function\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **`async def` and `await`**: These are used to declare asynchronous functions and wait for other asynchronous operations to complete.\n- **`asyncio.create_task()`**: This schedules an asynchronous function to run concurrently with the rest of the code.\n- **`loop.run_in_executor()`**: This allows you to run blocking (synchronous) code in a separate thread or process, making it async-compatible.\n\nThis approach allows you to interleave computation and other tasks efficiently, leveraging Python's asynchronous capabilities."
