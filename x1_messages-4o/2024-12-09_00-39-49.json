I've also tried setting my environment to the virtualenv that I want to update and then running from a different pip, but that fails as well. Here is the error I encountered:\n\n```\n(jm) E:\\python\\jm&gt;c:\\Python26\\Scripts\\pip install --upgrade pip\nDownloading/unpacking pip\n  Running setup.py egg_info for package pip\n    warning: no previously-included files matching '*.txt' found under directory 'docs\\_build'\n    no previously-included directories found matching 'docs\\_build\\_sources'\nInstalling collected packages: pip\n  Found existing installation: pip 0.7.1\n    Uninstalling pip:\n      Successfully uninstalled pip\n  Running setup.py install for pip\n    warning: no previously-included files matching '*.txt' found under directory 'docs\\_build'\n    no previously-included directories found matching 'docs\\_build\\_sources'\n    Installing pip-script.py script to c:\\Python26\\Scripts\n    Installing pip.exe script to c:\\Python26\\Scripts\n    Installing pip.exe.manifest script to c:\\Python26\\Scripts\n    Installing pip-2.6-script.py script to c:\\Python26\\Scripts\n    Installing pip-2.6.exe script to c:\\Python26\\Scripts\n    Installing pip-2.6.exe.manifest script to c:\\Python26\\Scripts\nException:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"c:\\Python26\\lib\\site-packages\\pip-0.7.1-py2.6.egg\\pip\\basecommand.py\", line 120, in main\n  File \"c:\\Python26\\lib\\site-packages\\pip-0.7.1-py2.6.egg\\pip\\commands\\install.py\", line 165, in run\n  File \"c:\\Python26\\lib\\site-packages\\pip-0.7.1-py2.6.egg\\pip\\req.py\", line 1251, in install\n  File \"c:\\Python26\\lib\\site-packages\\pip-0.7.1-py2.6.egg\\pip\\req.py\", line 466, in commit_uninstall\n  File \"c:\\Python26\\lib\\site-packages\\pip-0.7.1-py2.6.egg\\pip\\req.py\", line 1549, in commit\n  File \"c:\\Python26\\lib\\shutil.py\", line 216, in rmtree\n    rmtree(fullname, ignore_errors, onerror)\n  File \"c:\\Python26\\lib\\shutil.py\", line 216, in rmtree\n    rmtree(fullname, ignore_errors, onerror)\n  File \"c:\\Python26\\lib\\shutil.py\", line 221, in rmtree\n    onerror(os.remove, fullname, sys.exc_info())\n  File \"c:\\Python26\\lib\\shutil.py\", line 219, in rmtree\n    os.remove(fullname)\nWindowsError: [Error 5] Access is denied: 'c:\\\\users\\\\mark\\\\appdata\\\\local\\\\temp\\\\pip-gvsove-uninstall\\\\python26\\\\scripts\\\\pip.exe'\n```\nI'm hoping someone else has figured out a way around this. This isn't a problem on Linux."

        "content": "Updating `pip` on Windows can sometimes run into issues due to file locks or permissions. Here's a step-by-step method to help you update `pip` successfully:\n\n1. **Close Any Open Command Prompts**: Ensure that no command prompts or terminals are open that might be using `pip`.\n\n2. **Use Python's `-m` Option**: This can help avoid issues related to the file lock by not directly invoking the `pip` executable. Run the following command in your command prompt:\n   ```bash\n   python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n   ```\n   Make sure you're using the correct Python version. If you have multiple versions, specify the full path to the Python executable.\n\n3. **Run Command Prompt as Administrator**: Sometimes permission issues can be resolved by running the command prompt as an administrator. Right-click on the Command Prompt icon and select \"Run as administrator\" before executing the update command.\n\n4. **Check Python Environment**: Make sure you're in the correct virtual environment or using the correct Python version. You can activate your virtual environment by navigating to its directory and running:\n   ```bash\n   .\\Scripts\\activate\n   ```\n\n5. **Use a Different Installation Method**: If the above methods fail, try using an alternative method to update `pip`.\n\n   - **Download get-pip.py**: You can manually download the `get-pip.py` script from the official [pip website](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) and run it:\n     ```bash\n     python get-pip.py\n     ```\n\n6. **Check for Open Applications**: Sometimes, applications or processes that use Python can lock files. Ensure no such applications are running.\n\n7. **Use a Batch Script**: Create a batch script to update `pip`:\n   - Create a new text file and enter the following content:\n     ```batch\n     @echo off\n     setlocal enabledelayedexpansion\n     for /f \"delims=\" %%i in ('python -c \"import sys; print(sys.executable)\"') do set PYTHON_EXE=%%i\n     \"%PYTHON_EXE%\" -m pip install --upgrade pip\n     endlocal\n     ```\n   - Save it with a `.bat` extension and run it as an administrator.\n\n8. **Manual Deletion**: If the error persists, manually delete `pip.exe` from the `Scripts` directory in your Python installation path and then try running the update command again.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to update `pip` on your Windows system successfully."
