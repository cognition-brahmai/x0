        "content": "To convert an ISO 8601 timestamp to seconds in Python, you can use the `datetime` module, which is part of Python's standard library. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:\n\n1. Parse the ISO 8601 timestamp string into a `datetime` object.\n2. Convert the `datetime` object to a Unix timestamp (seconds since the epoch).\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timezone\n\n# Your ISO 8601 timestamp\niso_timestamp = '1984-06-02T19:05:00.000Z'\n\n# Parse the ISO 8601 timestamp into a datetime object\ndt = datetime.fromisoformat(iso_timestamp.replace('Z', '+00:00'))\n\n# Convert the datetime object to a Unix timestamp (seconds since the epoch)\nseconds = dt.timestamp()\n\n# Print the result\nprint(seconds)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- The `fromisoformat` function is used to parse the ISO 8601 string into a `datetime` object. Since the timestamp ends with 'Z', which indicates UTC time, we replace 'Z' with '+00:00' to ensure it is correctly interpreted as UTC.\n- The `timestamp` method is then used on the `datetime` object to get the time in seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970).\n\nThis will give you the timestamp in seconds. If you need to handle time zones more explicitly (e.g., if the timestamp includes offsets other than 'Z'), you might need more sophisticated handling with the `pytz` library or `dateutil` for more complex scenarios."
