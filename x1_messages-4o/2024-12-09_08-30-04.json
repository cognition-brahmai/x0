However, in one case, I encountered a webpage with a response header: GZIP encoding. When I attempted to print the source code of this webpage, all the symbols were displayed in my putty. How can I decode this GZIP encoded data to regular text in Python?"

Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can decode the GZIP encoded response from a webpage:\n\n1. **Download the Webpage Content**: Use libraries like `requests` to fetch the content of the webpage. Make sure to correctly handle the GZIP encoding.\n\n2. **Decode the GZIP Data**: Use the `gzip` module to decompress the data.\n\nHere's a complete example:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport gzip\nfrom io import BytesIO\n\n# URL of the webpage you want to download\nurl = 'http://example.com'\n\n# Fetch the webpage content\nresponse = requests.get(url, headers={'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip'})\n\n# Check if the response indicates GZIP encoding\nif response.headers.get('Content-Encoding') == 'gzip':\n    # Decompress the GZIP data using gzip module\n    buffer = BytesIO(response.content)\n    with gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=buffer) as gzip_file:\n        html_content = gzip_file.read().decode('utf-8')\nelse:\n    # If not GZIP encoded, just decode the content using UTF-8\n    html_content = response.content.decode('utf-8')\n\n# Print the decoded HTML content\nprint(html_content)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **`requests.get`**: This method is used to fetch the webpage. The `'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip'` header indicates that you can handle GZIP encoded responses.\n\n- **`Content-Encoding` Header**: Check if this header is set to 'gzip' to confirm that the response is indeed GZIP encoded.\n\n- **`gzip.GzipFile`**: This is used to decompress the GZIP content. You need to wrap the response content in a `BytesIO` object since `GzipFile` expects a file-like object.\n\n- **Decoding**: After decompression, make sure to decode the bytes to a string using the appropriate character encoding, usually UTF-8.\n\nWith this approach, you should be able to handle GZIP encoded responses and decode them into readable HTML or text content."
