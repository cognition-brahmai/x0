        "content": "Yes, wxPython does have GUI builders that can help you create interfaces without extensive coding, although they may not be as integrated as the form builder in Microsoft Visual Studio. Here are a few options you can consider:\n\n1. **wxFormBuilder**: This is one of the most popular tools for designing wxPython GUIs. It provides a drag-and-drop interface, allowing you to build forms visually. It generates XML files that can be converted into Python code, which you can then integrate into your application.\n\n2. **wxGlade**: This is another GUI designer for wxPython. It focuses on simplicity and ease of use, offering a straightforward interface for creating forms. wxGlade can generate code in Python, C++, and XRC (an XML resource format for wxWidgets).\n\n3. **Boa Constructor**: Although it's an older tool and not actively maintained, Boa Constructor offers a full-featured IDE for Python and wxPython development, including a visual GUI designer.\n\n4. **PythonCard**: This is a simpler framework for building GUI applications with wxPython. It includes a resource editor for creating user interfaces visually.\n\nWhile these tools provide visual design capabilities, you might still need to write some code to handle events and integrate the GUI with your application's logic. However, they can significantly reduce the amount of manual coding required to create the interface itself."
