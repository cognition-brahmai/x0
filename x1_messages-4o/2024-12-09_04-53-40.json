I have a static method in this class, \"addOrder\", which updates the dictionary. I am running 4 threads simultaneously, each for a different restaurant, and each thread calls the \"addOrder\" method. Here is the function that is executed by each thread:\n\n```python\ndef addOrders(restaurant_name):\n\n    #creates orders\n    ...\n\n    OrderBook.addOrder(restaurant_name, orders)\n```\n\nIs this operation thread-safe? Or should I use a lock before calling the \"addOrder\" method?"

        "content": "In Python, operations on dictionaries are not inherently thread-safe. Although the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython ensures that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time, it does not guarantee that compound operations (like checking if a key exists and then modifying the dictionary) are atomic. Therefore, if your `addOrder` method modifies the shared dictionary, you need to ensure thread safety.\n\nHere's what you should consider:\n\n1. **Atomic Operations**: Simple operations like assigning a value to a key (`dict[key] = value`) are atomic under CPython due to the GIL, but compound operations (like checking and then setting) are not.\n\n2. **Compound Operations**: If `addOrder` involves checking if a key exists, modifying a value, or inserting/updating multiple keys in a single action, you should use a lock to prevent race conditions.\n\n3. **Thread Safety with Locks**: To make `addOrder` thread-safe, you can use a `threading.Lock`. Here's an example of how you might modify your class:\n\n    ```python\n    import threading\n\n    class OrderBook:\n        _lock = threading.Lock()\n        _orders = {restaurant_name: [] for restaurant_name in ['restaurant1', 'restaurant2', 'restaurant3', 'restaurant4']}\n\n        @staticmethod\n        def addOrder(restaurant_name, orders):\n            with OrderBook._lock:\n                if restaurant_name in OrderBook._orders:\n                    OrderBook._orders[restaurant_name].extend(orders)\n                else:\n                    OrderBook._orders[restaurant_name] = orders\n\n    def addOrders(restaurant_name):\n        # creates orders\n        orders = ...\n        OrderBook.addOrder(restaurant_name, orders)\n    ```\n\nBy using a lock, you ensure that only one thread can modify the dictionary at a time, preventing potential race conditions and ensuring the integrity of your data."
