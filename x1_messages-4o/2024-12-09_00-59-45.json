However, when I try to create an instance of `FavoriteCar` and print some attributes, I encounter an error \"AttributeError: __fields_set__\". Can anyone explain what's happening here? I'm using pydantic because I need a way to quickly convert Python objects to `dict` (or JSON) and back. Here is my code:\n\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nfrom typing import List\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\n@dataclass\nclass User(BaseModel):\n    id: int \n\n@dataclass\nclass FavoriteCar(User):\n    car_names: List[str] \n\ncar = FavoriteCar(id=1, car_names=[\"Acura\"])\nprint(f\"{car.id} {car.car_names[0]}\")\n```\n\nAnd the error that I'm getting is:\n\n```python\nself.__fields_set__.add(name)\nAttributeError: __fields_set__\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering arises from the use of the `dataclass` decorator with classes that inherit from `pydantic.BaseModel`. In Pydantic, `BaseModel` and Python's `dataclass` are both used to define classes with a focus on data, but they are not directly compatible when used together. Pydantic's `BaseModel` already provides features for data validation and model creation, so you don't need to use `dataclass` with it.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you should remove the `@dataclass` decorator from your classes. Here\u2019s how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass User(BaseModel):\n    id: int\n\nclass FavoriteCar(User):\n    car_names: List[str]\n\ncar = FavoriteCar(id=1, car_names=[\"Acura\"])\nprint(f\"{car.id} {car.car_names[0]}\")\n```\n\nBy removing the `@dataclass` decorators, you will allow Pydantic to manage the creation and validation of your models correctly. This should resolve the `AttributeError` you're encountering. Pydantic models are already designed to work with type annotations for data validation and serialization/deserialization to/from dictionaries and JSON, which aligns with your original intention of using Pydantic."
