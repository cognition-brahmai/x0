The function should take a sentence as input and return an object with properties for tense and voice. The tense property should have values of present, past, future, or present perfect. The voice property should have values of active or passive. For example, if given the sentence \"The cake was baked by the chef\", the function should return {tense: past, voice: passive}."

        "content": "Creating a JavaScript function to determine the tense and voice of a given sentence involves some complexity, as natural language processing can be quite intricate. However, I can guide you through a basic approach to achieve this. This implementation will be a simple heuristic-based method and may not cover all edge cases or complex sentence structures.\n\nHere's a simple JavaScript function to get you started:\n\n```javascript\nfunction determineTenseAndVoice(sentence) {\n    // Convert the sentence to lower case for simpler matching\n    const lowerSentence = sentence.toLowerCase();\n\n    // Regular expressions for detecting tense\n    const presentRegex = /\\b(is|am|are|do|does|has|have)\\b/;\n    const pastRegex = /\\b(was|were|did|had)\\b/;\n    const futureRegex = /\\b(will|shall)\\b/;\n    const presentPerfectRegex = /\\b(has|have) (been )?\\b/;\n\n    // Regular expressions for detecting voice\n    const passiveVoiceRegex = /\\b(by)\\b/;\n\n    // Initialize tense and voice\n    let tense = \"unknown\";\n    let voice = \"active\";\n\n    // Determine the tense\n    if (presentPerfectRegex.test(lowerSentence)) {\n        tense = \"present perfect\";\n    } else if (presentRegex.test(lowerSentence)) {\n        tense = \"present\";\n    } else if (pastRegex.test(lowerSentence)) {\n        tense = \"past\";\n    } else if (futureRegex.test(lowerSentence)) {\n        tense = \"future\";\n    }\n\n    // Determine the voice\n    if (passiveVoiceRegex.test(lowerSentence) && pastRegex.test(lowerSentence)) {\n        voice = \"passive\";\n    }\n\n    return { tense, voice };\n}\n\n// Example usage\nconst sentence = \"The cake was baked by the chef\";\nconst result = determineTenseAndVoice(sentence);\nconsole.log(result); // { tense: 'past', voice: 'passive' }\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Tense Detection**: \n   - The function uses regular expressions to detect keywords that typically indicate present, past, future, and present perfect tenses.\n   \n2. **Voice Detection**:\n   - It checks for the presence of \"by\" which is often used in passive constructions, combined with past tense auxiliary verbs to infer a passive voice.\n\n3. **Limitations**:\n   - This simple method may not handle complex sentences, different sentence structures, or all grammatical nuances accurately.\n   - It assumes that a sentence containing \"by\" and a past tense verb is passive, which may not always hold true.\n\nFor more accurate natural language processing tasks, using a library like `compromise`, `nlp.js`, or integrating with more sophisticated NLP tools or APIs would be beneficial. This approach is a starting point and can be expanded upon with more advanced techniques."
