        "content": "I am currently using Django south and have two applications, \"tv\" and \"movies\". Each of them has a VideoFile model. I noticed that these two videofile objects are very similar and I want to remove this redundancy by creating a new model in a separate application, \"media\". This new model will contain a generic VideoFile class and will use inheritance to extend it. All these three applications are already managed by south migrations. According to the recommendations from the south documentation, it is bad practice to combine a schema and data migration. They propose that it should be done in a few steps. I was thinking that it could be done using separate migrations like this (assuming media.VideoFile is already created):\n\n1. Schema migration to rename all fields in tv.VideoFile and movies.VideoFile that will move to the new media.VideoFile model, maybe to something like old_name, old_size, etc.\n2. Schema migration to tv.VideoFile and movies.VideoFile to inherit from media.VideoFile.\n3. Data migration to copy old_name to name, old_size to size, etc.\n4. Scheme migration to remove old_ fields.\n\nBefore I commit to all this work, I wanted to ask if this approach will work? Or is there a better way to achieve this?"

        "content": "Your approach is generally sound and aligns with best practices for handling schema and data migrations separately. Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown of your plan, with a few additional considerations to ensure a smooth transition:\n\n1. **Prepare the New Model:**\n   - Ensure that your `media.VideoFile` model is properly defined and migrated. This acts as the base class for the other models.\n\n2. **Rename Fields in Existing Models:**\n   - Perform a schema migration to rename fields in `tv.VideoFile` and `movies.VideoFile`. This helps maintain data integrity while you transition to the new structure.\n\n3. **Update Model Inheritance:**\n   - Modify `tv.VideoFile` and `movies.VideoFile` to inherit from `media.VideoFile`. This will involve updating the model definitions and performing another schema migration.\n\n4. **Data Migration:**\n   - Write a data migration to copy data from the renamed fields (`old_name`, `old_size`, etc.) to the new fields (`name`, `size`, etc.) in the `media.VideoFile` model. Make sure to handle any potential data discrepancies or inconsistencies during this step.\n\n5. **Clean Up:**\n   - Once the data migration is confirmed to be successful, perform another schema migration to remove the old fields (`old_name`, `old_size`, etc.) from `tv.VideoFile` and `movies.VideoFile`.\n\n6. **Test Thoroughly:**\n   - Ensure that all migrations run smoothly in a testing environment before applying them to production. Check that the data is correctly transferred and that your applications function as expected with the new model structure.\n\n7. **Update Application Logic:**\n   - Review and update any application logic that interacts with the `tv.VideoFile` and `movies.VideoFile` models to ensure compatibility with the new `media.VideoFile` base model.\n\nBy breaking down the process into these discrete steps, you minimize the risk of errors and make it easier to troubleshoot any issues that arise. This approach also aligns well with South's recommendations for handling complex migrations. If you're using Django 1.7 or later, consider using Django's built-in migration framework as it offers more advanced capabilities and might simplify the process."
