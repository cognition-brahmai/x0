Can I train DetectNet on thousands of different images with one specific rotation angle of an object, to detect objects at any rotation angles? Also, is the rotation invariance applicable to other networks like Yolo, Yolo v2, DenseBox on which DetectNet is based?"

        "content": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), including modern architectures like DetectNet, YOLO, and DenseBox, are not inherently rotation invariant. This means that if you train a CNN with images of an object at a specific rotation angle, the network might struggle to recognize the same object at different angles unless it has seen similar variations during training.\n\nTo achieve rotation invariance, or at least a degree of robustness to rotations, you typically need to augment your training dataset with rotated versions of the original images. This augmentation process helps the network learn to recognize objects regardless of their orientation. Tools and libraries for data augmentation are widely available and often include functionality for random rotations, flipping, scaling, and other transformations.\n\nRegarding DetectNet specifically, it does not have built-in rotation invariance. Training it on images with various rotations is essential for it to perform well across different orientations. The same principle applies to YOLO, YOLO v2, and DenseBox. All these networks benefit from data augmentation to handle rotation and other variations in the input data.\n\nIn summary, to make these networks more robust to rotations, you should:\n\n1. Augment your training dataset with rotated images.\n2. Consider using techniques like rotation-equivariant CNNs if absolute rotation invariance is crucial for your application.\n\nThese steps will help improve the model's ability to detect objects at various angles."
