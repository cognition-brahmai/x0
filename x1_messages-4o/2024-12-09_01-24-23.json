However, I'm now required to modify my program to calculate and plot the running average of the data, using the formula:\n\n$Y_k=\\frac{1}{2r}\\sum_{m=-r}^r y_{k+m}$\n\nWhere `r=5` in this case and the `y_k` is the second column in the data file. I'm required to plot both the original data and the running average on the same graph. I'm not sure how to calculate the sum in Python in a way that takes every ten points in the data, averages it, and does this until the end of the points. Here is what I have so far:\n\n```python\nfrom pylab import plot, ylim, xlim, show, xlabel, ylabel\nfrom numpy import linspace, loadtxt\n\ndata = loadtxt(\"sunspots.txt\", float)\nr=5.0\n\nx = data[:,0]\ny = data[:,1]\n\nplot(x,y)\nxlim(0,1000)\nxlabel(\"Months since Jan 1749.\")\nylabel(\"No. of Sun spots\")\nshow()\n```"

        "content": "To calculate and plot the running average of the data using the given formula, you can create a function that computes the running average for each point in the data. Then, you can plot both the original data and the running average on the same graph. Here's how you can modify your existing code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom pylab import plot, ylim, xlim, show, xlabel, ylabel\nfrom numpy import linspace, loadtxt\n\n# Load the data from the file\ndata = loadtxt(\"sunspots.txt\", float)\nr = 5  # The window size for averaging\n\n# Extract the columns\nx = data[:, 0]\ny = data[:, 1]\n\n# Function to calculate the running average\ndef running_average(y, r):\n    n = len(y)\n    y_avg = []\n    for k in range(n):\n        # Calculate the start and end indices for the window\n        start_index = max(0, k - r)\n        end_index = min(n, k + r + 1)\n        \n        # Calculate the average for the current window\n        window_average = sum(y[start_index:end_index]) / (end_index - start_index)\n        y_avg.append(window_average)\n    return y_avg\n\n# Calculate the running average\ny_running_avg = running_average(y, r)\n\n# Plot the original data\nplot(x, y, label='Original Data')\n# Plot the running average\nplot(x, y_running_avg, label='Running Average', color='red')\n\n# Set the limits and labels for the plot\nxlim(0, 1000)\nxlabel(\"Months since Jan 1749.\")\nylabel(\"No. of Sun spots\")\nylim(0, max(y) + 10)\n# Add a legend to distinguish the two lines\nlegend = plt.legend(loc='upper right')\nshow()\n```\n\nIn this code, the `running_average` function calculates the running average for each point in the data array `y`. It uses a sliding window of size `2r+1` centered at each point `k`. Boundary conditions are handled by adjusting the start and end indices so that they remain within the bounds of the array.\n\nAfter computing the running average, both the original data and the running average are plotted on the same graph using different colors for clarity. The `legend` function is used to add a legend to the plot, so you can easily distinguish between the original data and the running average."
