However, my current script copies everything after it finds the string. How can I modify my script to copy only the lines that contain the specific string?\n\nHere is my current code:\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nf = open('list1.txt')\nf1 = open('output.txt', 'a')\n\ndoIHaveToCopyTheLine=False\n\nfor line in f.readlines():\n\n    if 'tests/file/myword' in line:\n        doIHaveToCopyTheLine=True\n\n    if doIHaveToCopyTheLine:\n        f1.write(line)\n\nf1.close()\nf.close()\n```"

        "content": "To modify your script so that it only copies lines containing the specific string \"tests/file/myword\" rather than copying everything after finding the string, you need to write each line as soon as you find the string in it without toggling a flag. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\n# Open the input and output files\nwith open('list1.txt', 'r') as f, open('output.txt', 'a') as f1:\n    # Iterate through each line in the input file\n    for line in f:\n        # Check if the specific string is in the current line\n        if 'tests/file/myword' in line:\n            # Write the line to the output file\n            f1.write(line)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Removed the Flag**: You don't need a flag to determine if you should start copying. Instead, check each line independently.\n2. **Use of `with` Statement**: This handles opening and closing files more gracefully and ensures that files are properly closed even if an error occurs.\n3. **Simplified Loop**: The loop directly checks if the string is in each line and writes it if the condition is met."
