For example, given the following code:\n\n```python\nindexes = [5, 12, 17]\nlist = range(20)\n```\n\nI want to achieve this result:\n\n```python\npart1 = list[:5]\npart2 = list[5:12]\npart3 = list[12:17]\npart4 = list[17:]\n```\n\nIf there are no indexes provided, the entire list should be returned. How can I accomplish this?"

        "content": "To split a list into multiple parts based on a set of arbitrary indexes, you can create a function that iterates over the given indexes, slicing the list accordingly. Here's one way to implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef split_list_by_indexes(lst, indexes):\n    # Ensure the indexes are sorted\n    indexes = sorted(indexes)\n    \n    # Initialize the start index\n    start_index = 0\n    \n    # Initialize a list to hold the parts\n    parts = []\n    \n    # Iterate over the indexes\n    for index in indexes:\n        # Append the slice from start_index to the current index\n        parts.append(lst[start_index:index])\n        # Update the start index\n        start_index = index\n    \n    # Append the remaining part of the list\n    parts.append(lst[start_index:])\n    \n    return parts\n\n# Example usage\nindexes = [5, 12, 17]\nlst = list(range(20))\n\nparts = split_list_by_indexes(lst, indexes)\nfor i, part in enumerate(parts):\n    print(f\"part{i+1} = {part}\")\n```\n\nThis function `split_list_by_indexes` first sorts the indexes to ensure they are in order, then iterates over them to slice the list into parts. It also appends the remaining part of the list after the last index. If no indexes are provided, it simply returns the entire list as one part. This solution efficiently handles the splitting of lists based on arbitrary indexes."
