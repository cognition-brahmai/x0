I have a dictionary structured like this:\n\n```python\nuser_dict = {\n            \"user1\": [(\"video1\", 10),(\"video2\",20),(\"video3\",1)],\n            \"user2\": [(\"video1\", 4),(\"video2\",8),(\"video6\",45)],\n            ...\n            \"user100\": [(\"video1\", 46),(\"video2\",34),(\"video6\",4)]                 \n            } \n```\nwhere `(video1,10)` signifies `(videoid, number of requests)`. I need to randomly select 10 users and perform calculations on the associated values, such as calculating the number of video IDs for each user and summing up the total number of requests for these 10 users. I need to do this for a varying number of random users (20, 30, 40, etc.). I know that `random.choice` can only select one value at a time, so how can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To randomly select multiple keys (users) from your dictionary and then perform calculations on the associated values, you can use the `random.sample` function, which allows you to select multiple unique items from a list. Here's how you can accomplish this:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# Your dictionary\nuser_dict = {\n    \"user1\": [(\"video1\", 10), (\"video2\", 20), (\"video3\", 1)],\n    \"user2\": [(\"video1\", 4), (\"video2\", 8), (\"video6\", 45)],\n    # ... (add other users)\n    \"user100\": [(\"video1\", 46), (\"video2\", 34), (\"video6\", 4)]\n}\n\ndef analyze_random_users(user_dict, num_users):\n    # Ensure that the number of users requested does not exceed the number of available users\n    if num_users > len(user_dict):\n        raise ValueError(\"Number of users to select exceeds the number of available users.\")\n\n    # Randomly select `num_users` keys from the dictionary\n    selected_users = random.sample(user_dict.keys(), num_users)\n\n    total_requests = 0\n    video_counts = {}\n\n    for user in selected_users:\n        videos = user_dict[user]\n        # Calculate the total number of requests\n        total_requests += sum(requests for _, requests in videos)\n        \n        # Count the number of unique video IDs for each user\n        for video_id, _ in videos:\n            if video_id in video_counts:\n                video_counts[video_id] += 1\n            else:\n                video_counts[video_id] = 1\n\n    return total_requests, video_counts\n\n# Example usage\nnum_users_to_select = 10  # You can change this to 20, 30, 40, etc.\ntotal_requests, video_counts = analyze_random_users(user_dict, num_users_to_select)\n\nprint(f\"Total requests for {num_users_to_select} random users: {total_requests}\")\nprint(f\"Video counts: {video_counts}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Random Selection**: `random.sample(user_dict.keys(), num_users)` is used to select `num_users` unique keys from the dictionary without replacement.\n\n2. **Calculations**:\n   - **Total Requests**: Sum up all the requests for the selected users.\n   - **Video Counts**: Count how many times each video ID appears for the selected users.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: If you try to select more users than are available in the dictionary, a `ValueError` is raised.\n\nYou can modify the `num_users_to_select` variable to change the number of users you want to randomly select and analyze."
