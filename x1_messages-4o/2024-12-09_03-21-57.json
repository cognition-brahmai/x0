In the script editor, I can select stats from the pulldown menu after typing scipy, but I am unable to do so within the python console. The options does not appear in the pulldown menu. I am currently using pandas 2.7 and SciPy 0.13.0. Are there any known issues causing this?"

        "content": "The AttributeError you're encountering is likely due to the way the `scipy` module is being imported or possibly due to an outdated version of SciPy. Here's a step-by-step approach to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Correct Import Statement**: Make sure you are importing the `stats` module correctly. The correct import statement should be:\n   ```python\n   from scipy import stats\n   ```\n\n2. **Update SciPy**: The version of SciPy you are using (0.13.0) is quite old and may not have the `stats` module or certain functionalities that you are trying to use. Consider updating SciPy to a more recent version. You can do this using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade scipy\n   ```\n\n3. **Check for Name Conflicts**: Ensure that there are no files named `scipy.py` or `stats.py` in your working directory that might be causing a conflict with the import. Python might be importing the local file instead of the actual `scipy` library.\n\n4. **Verify Installation**: Double-check if SciPy is installed correctly. You can verify this by running:\n   ```python\n   import scipy\n   print(scipy.__version__)\n   ```\n\n5. **Environment Issues**: If you are using a virtual environment, make sure it is activated and SciPy is installed within that environment.\n\n6. **Check Python Console**: Since you mentioned the issue occurs within the Python console, ensure that the console is using the same Python interpreter and environment where SciPy is installed.\n\n7. **Dependencies**: Sometimes, issues arise from incompatible dependencies. When you update SciPy, it should resolve most dependency issues automatically. However, you may also need to update other related packages.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the AttributeError and properly use `scipy.stats` in your script. If the issue persists after these steps, consider creating a new virtual environment and installing necessary packages afresh to eliminate any environment-related problems."
