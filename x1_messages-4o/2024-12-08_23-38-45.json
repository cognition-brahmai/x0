        "content": "Certainly! Below is a PHP code snippet that calculates the average of an array of numbers. The code includes comments to explain each step:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Function to calculate the average of numbers in an array\nfunction calculateAverage($numbers) {\n    // Check if the array is not empty\n    if (count($numbers) === 0) {\n        return 0; // Return 0 if the array is empty\n    }\n\n    // Initialize a variable to store the sum of numbers\n    $sum = 0;\n\n    // Loop through each number in the array\n    foreach ($numbers as $number) {\n        // Add the current number to the sum\n        $sum += $number;\n    }\n\n    // Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the number of elements\n    $average = $sum / count($numbers);\n\n    // Return the calculated average\n    return $average;\n}\n\n// Example usage\n$numbersArray = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]; // Define an array of numbers\n$average = calculateAverage($numbersArray); // Call the function to calculate the average\necho \"The average is: \" . $average; // Output the result\n?>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Function Definition**: A function `calculateAverage` is defined to take an array of numbers as its parameter.\n2. **Empty Array Check**: The function first checks if the array is empty. If it is, it returns 0 to avoid division by zero errors.\n3. **Sum Initialization**: A variable `$sum` is initialized to store the sum of all numbers in the array.\n4. **Looping Through the Array**: The `foreach` loop iterates over each number in the array, adding it to `$sum`.\n5. **Average Calculation**: The average is calculated by dividing the total sum by the count of numbers in the array.\n6. **Result Return**: The function returns the calculated average.\n7. **Example Usage**: An example array is defined, and the function is called to calculate and print the average of the numbers in the array."
