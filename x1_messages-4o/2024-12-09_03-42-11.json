        "content": "To include source code in bullet lists with reStructuredText and avoid the \"Literal block expected; none found\" warning, you need to ensure that the code blocks are properly indented and formatted. In reStructuredText, after the list item and the double colons (`::`), you should indent the code block consistently. Here's how you can structure it:\n\n```rst\n- List item 1 ::\n\n  .. code-block:: python\n\n     # Your code sample\n     print(\"Hello, World!\")\n     for i in range(5):\n         print(i)\n\n- List item 2 ::\n\n  .. code-block:: python\n\n     # Another code sample\n     def greet(name):\n         return f\"Hello, {name}\"\n\n     print(greet(\"Alice\"))\n```\n\nHere's what's happening:\n\n1. **Double Colons (`::`)**: This indicates that what follows is a literal block, such as a code block.\n\n2. **Indentation**: Ensure that the code block is indented under the list item. The indentation level should be consistent and typically requires two spaces after the item marker and two spaces for the code block itself.\n\n3. **Code Block Directive**: Use the `.. code-block::` directive to specify the language for syntax highlighting (e.g., `python` in the example).\n\nMake sure there is a blank line before and after the `.. code-block::` directive for it to be recognized correctly.\n\nBy following this structure, you should be able to include source code in your bullet lists without encountering warnings."
