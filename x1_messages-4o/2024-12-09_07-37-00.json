I want to assign `some_var['my_key']` to `my_var` if `some_var` contains `'my_key'`, otherwise, `my_var` should be set to `None`. I tried to do it this way:\n\n```python\nmy_var = some_var['my_key'] | None\n```\n\nBut it does not seem to work."

        "content": "In Python, the most efficient and straightforward way to access a dictionary key and return `None` if the key does not exist is to use the `dict.get()` method. This method allows you to specify a default value that will be returned if the key is not found in the dictionary. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nmy_var = some_var.get('my_key', None)\n```\n\nIn this code, `some_var.get('my_key', None)` will return the value associated with `'my_key'` if it exists in `some_var`. If `'my_key'` does not exist, it will return `None`, which you can then assign to `my_var`. This approach is concise and handles the scenario you described effectively."
