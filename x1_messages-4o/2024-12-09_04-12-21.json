        "content": "If you want to display tick labels but not the actual tick marks or the spines, you can use the following approach. Instead of removing the ticks with `set_xticks([])` and `set_yticks([])`, you actually want to hide the ticks and spines while keeping the labels visible. Here's how you can achieve that with Matplotlib:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Sample data\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ny = [10, 20, 25, 30, 40]\n\n# Create a plot\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(x, y)\n\n# Hide the spines\nax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['left'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['bottom'].set_visible(False)\n\n# Hide the ticks\nax.xaxis.set_ticks_position('none')  # Hides the x ticks\nax.yaxis.set_ticks_position('none')  # Hides the y ticks\n\n# Keep the labels visible\nax.set_xticklabels(ax.get_xticks())\nax.set_yticklabels(ax.get_yticks())\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this code, we hide the spines (borders) of the plot using `ax.spines['side'].set_visible(False)` for each side you want to hide. We also remove the tick marks by setting the tick positions to 'none'. The labels are retained by setting the tick labels explicitly with `ax.set_xticklabels()` and `ax.set_yticklabels()`, using the current ticks to generate labels.\n\nThis way, you can achieve the appearance of having only the tick labels without the corresponding ticks or spines."
