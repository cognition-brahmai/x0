I have been trying to read in an RGB image and convert it to grayscale, but I am finding it difficult as the matplotlib tutorial doesn't cover this. In Matlab, I use the code `img = rgb2gray(imread('image.png'))`. I tried to slice the array in Python with the code `lum_img = img[:,:,0]` but this isn't the same as converting from RGB to grayscale. I wrote a simple function for this purpose, but I am hoping to find a built-in function since this is a common operation in image processing. Here is my function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef rgb2gray(rgb):\n\n    r, g, b = rgb[:,:,0], rgb[:,:,1], rgb[:,:,2]\n    gray = 0.2989 * r + 0.5870 * g + 0.1140 * b\n\n    return gray\n```"

        "content": "To convert an RGB image to grayscale in Python using `matplotlib`, you can use the `rgb2gray` function from the `skimage.color` module, which is part of the `scikit-image` library. This function is designed to perform the conversion using the same luminance-preserving approach you've implemented manually. Here's how you can do it:\n\nFirst, ensure you have `scikit-image` installed. You can install it via pip if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\npip install scikit-image\n```\n\nThen, you can use the following code to read an image using `matplotlib`, convert it to grayscale, and display both the original and grayscale images:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom skimage import color, io\n\n# Read the image using matplotlib\nimg = io.imread('image.png')\n\n# Convert the image to grayscale using skimage\ngray_img = color.rgb2gray(img)\n\n# Display the original and grayscale images\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 5))\nax = axes.ravel()\n\nax[0].imshow(img)\nax[0].set_title(\"Original RGB Image\")\nax[0].axis('off')\n\nax[1].imshow(gray_img, cmap='gray')\nax[1].set_title(\"Grayscale Image\")\nax[1].axis('off')\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Reading the Image:** The `io.imread` function from `skimage` is used here to read the image file.\n- **Converting to Grayscale:** The `color.rgb2gray` function converts the RGB image to grayscale by applying the same luminance-preserving weights (0.2989, 0.5870, 0.1140) that you used in your custom function.\n- **Displaying Images:** `matplotlib.pyplot` is used to display the original RGB image and the resulting grayscale image side by side.\n\nThis approach leverages a well-tested library function for the conversion, ensuring that the operation is performed efficiently and correctly."
