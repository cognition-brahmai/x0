When an exception occurs in a slot, it is printed to the screen but does not bubble up, which affects my testing strategy as I don't get to see the test fail. Is there a workaround for this problem? Here is an example of the issue:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom PyQt4 import QtGui, QtCore\n\nclass Test(QtGui.QPushButton):\n    def __init__(self, parent=None):\n        QtGui.QWidget.__init__(self, parent)\n        self.setText(\"hello\")\n        self.connect(self, QtCore.SIGNAL(\"clicked()\"), self.buttonClicked)\n\n    def buttonClicked(self):\n        print \"clicked\"\n        raise Exception(\"wow\")\n\napp=QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv)\nt=Test()\nt.show()\ntry:\n    app.exec_()\nexcept:\n    print \"exiting\"\n```\n\nIn this code, as you can see, even though an exception is raised in the `buttonClicked` method, the program never quits."

        "content": "When using PyQt, exceptions that occur in slots (such as the `buttonClicked` method) are indeed often suppressed, which can make debugging difficult. This is because PyQt handles them internally, and they don't propagate up to the application level where you might expect them to terminate the program.\n\nTo handle this situation and make sure exceptions in slots are visible and can be tested effectively, you can use the following strategies:\n\n1. **Override `sys.excepthook`:** You can override the default exception handler for uncaught exceptions. This allows you to define what happens when an exception is raised, such as printing the traceback or logging it.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom PyQt4 import QtGui, QtCore\nimport traceback\n\nclass Test(QtGui.QPushButton):\n    def __init__(self, parent=None):\n        QtGui.QWidget.__init__(self, parent)\n        self.setText(\"hello\")\n        self.connect(self, QtCore.SIGNAL(\"clicked()\"), self.buttonClicked)\n\n    def buttonClicked(self):\n        print(\"clicked\")\n        raise Exception(\"wow\")\n\ndef handle_exception(exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback):\n    if issubclass(exc_type, KeyboardInterrupt):\n        # If it's a KeyboardInterrupt, call the default handler\n        sys.__excepthook__(exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback)\n        return\n    print(\"Uncaught exception\", exc_type, exc_value)\n    traceback.print_tb(exc_traceback)\n\nsys.excepthook = handle_exception\n\napp = QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv)\nt = Test()\nt.show()\ntry:\n    app.exec_()\nexcept:\n    print(\"exiting\")\n```\n\n2. **Use a try-except block inside the slot:** Another way to handle exceptions is to wrap the code inside the slot with a try-except block. This is more localized and can be useful if you want to handle specific exceptions differently.\n\n```python\ndef buttonClicked(self):\n    try:\n        print(\"clicked\")\n        raise Exception(\"wow\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Exception occurred: {e}\")\n```\n\n3. **Event Filters and Custom Handlers:** For more advanced use cases, you can install event filters or create custom handlers to catch exceptions from signals and slots.\n\nUsing these strategies, you should be able to catch exceptions that occur in slots and handle them appropriately for testing or debugging purposes."
