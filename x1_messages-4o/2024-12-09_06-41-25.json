Should I use queue.Queue and the threading package to achieve this?"

        "content": "To limit the queue size in a `ThreadPoolExecutor` from the `concurrent.futures` package, you can use a custom implementation by subclassing `ThreadPoolExecutor` and overriding the `submit` method to control the queue size. Alternatively, you can use a `queue.Queue` in conjunction with threading to manage the tasks manually, but that might be more complex than necessary.\n\nHere's an example of how you can subclass `ThreadPoolExecutor` to limit the queue size:\n\n```python\nfrom concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor\nimport queue\n\nclass LimitedThreadPoolExecutor(ThreadPoolExecutor):\n    def __init__(self, max_workers=None, max_queue_size=0, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(max_workers, *args, **kwargs)\n        self._queue = queue.Queue(max_queue_size)\n\n    def submit(self, fn, *args, **kwargs):\n        # Block until a free slot in the queue is available\n        self._queue.put(None)\n        # Submit the task\n        future = super().submit(fn, *args, **kwargs)\n        # When the task is done, release the slot in the queue\n        future.add_done_callback(lambda f: self._queue.get())\n        return future\n\ndef some_func(arg):\n    # does some heavy lifting\n    # outputs some results\n    print(f\"Processing {arg}\")\n\n# Usage\nmax_workers = 1\nmax_queue_size = 10\n\nwith LimitedThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_workers, max_queue_size=max_queue_size) as executor:\n    for arg in range(10000000):\n        executor.submit(some_func, arg)\n```\n\nThis subclass `LimitedThreadPoolExecutor` manages a queue with a maximum size specified by `max_queue_size`. It uses this queue to block the submission of new tasks until a slot becomes available, effectively limiting the number of tasks queued at any given time.\n\nBy setting `max_queue_size` to a suitable number, you can control the memory usage and avoid submitting too many futures at once. Adjust `max_queue_size` and `max_workers` according to your application's requirements and resources."
