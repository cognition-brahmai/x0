        "content": "Certainly! You can use JavaScript to analyze sentences and identify those that don't fit a specific context or violate certain criteria. For this example, let's focus on two criteria: identifying sentences that are in the past tense and detecting sentences containing a specific word.\n\nTo achieve this, we'll use basic natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Note that for complex NLP tasks, it's often better to use specialized libraries or APIs, but here's a simple example using JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\n// Sample text\nconst text = `\n  I love programming. \n  Yesterday, I went to the store. \n  Today, I am learning JavaScript. \n  I will go to the park tomorrow.\n`;\n\n// Criteria\nconst specificWord = 'yesterday';\nconst pastTenseIndicators = ['ed', 'was', 'were', 'had', 'did'];\n\n// Function to check if a sentence is in past tense\nfunction isPastTense(sentence) {\n  return pastTenseIndicators.some(indicator => sentence.includes(indicator));\n}\n\n// Function to check if a sentence contains a specific word\nfunction containsSpecificWord(sentence, word) {\n  return sentence.toLowerCase().includes(word.toLowerCase());\n}\n\n// Function to analyze text and find sentences that violate criteria\nfunction findViolatingSentences(text, specificWord) {\n  const sentences = text.match(/[^.!?]*[.!?]/g) || [];\n  const violatingSentences = [];\n\n  sentences.forEach(sentence => {\n    const trimmedSentence = sentence.trim();\n    if (isPastTense(trimmedSentence) || containsSpecificWord(trimmedSentence, specificWord)) {\n      violatingSentences.push(trimmedSentence);\n    }\n  });\n\n  return violatingSentences;\n}\n\n// Find and log sentences that violate the criteria\nconst violatingSentences = findViolatingSentences(text, specificWord);\nconsole.log('Violating Sentences:', violatingSentences);\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Text Splitting**: The text is split into sentences using a regular expression that matches sentence-ending punctuation.\n\n2. **Criteria Checks**:\n   - **Past Tense**: The function `isPastTense` checks for simple indicators of past tense, such as verbs ending in \"ed\" or common past tense auxiliary verbs. Note that this is a basic approach and won't cover all cases.\n   - **Specific Word**: The function `containsSpecificWord` checks if a sentence contains the specified word.\n\n3. **Finding Violating Sentences**: The function `findViolatingSentences` goes through each sentence and checks if it meets either of the criteria. Violating sentences are collected and printed.\n\nThis code provides a basic framework and can be expanded with more sophisticated NLP techniques or integrated with libraries such as Natural or compromise.js for more advanced analysis."
