        "content": "To calculate the final amount owed for 10 products purchased from three vendors with varying prices and quantities, including different tax rates for each vendor, and split the payment between two payment methods using MATLAB, you can follow these steps. I'll provide an example code to illustrate this:\n\n1. **Define the Products and Vendors:** \n   - Each product has a price and quantity.\n   - Each vendor has a different tax rate.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Cost for Each Vendor:**\n   - Multiply the price by the quantity for each product.\n   - Apply the vendor's tax rate to the subtotal.\n\n3. **Calculate the Overall Total:**\n   - Sum the total costs from all vendors.\n\n4. **Split the Payment:**\n   - Divide the total amount between two payment methods.\n\nHere's an example MATLAB script that demonstrates this process:\n\n```matlab\n% Define product details: prices and quantities for each vendor\nproductPrices = [\n    10, 15, 20;  % Vendor 1\n    12, 18, 25;  % Vendor 2\n    14, 22, 28   % Vendor 3\n];\nproductQuantities = [\n    2, 3, 1;  % Vendor 1\n    1, 2, 4;  % Vendor 2\n    5, 1, 2   % Vendor 3\n];\n\n% Define tax rates for each vendor\ntaxRates = [0.1, 0.15, 0.08];  % 10%, 15%, and 8% for vendors 1, 2, and 3\n\n% Initialize total cost\ntotalCost = 0;\n\n% Calculate total cost for each vendor\nfor vendor = 1:3\n    % Calculate subtotal for this vendor\n    subtotal = sum(productPrices(vendor, :) .* productQuantities(vendor, :));\n    \n    % Apply tax\n    totalWithTax = subtotal * (1 + taxRates(vendor));\n    \n    % Add to total cost\n    totalCost = totalCost + totalWithTax;\nend\n\n% Display the overall total cost\nfprintf('Overall Total Cost: %.2f\\n', totalCost);\n\n% Split the payment between two payment methods (e.g., 60% and 40%)\npaymentMethod1 = 0.6 * totalCost;\npaymentMethod2 = 0.4 * totalCost;\n\nfprintf('Payment Method 1 Amount: %.2f\\n', paymentMethod1);\nfprintf('Payment Method 2 Amount: %.2f\\n', paymentMethod2);\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Product Prices and Quantities:** These are defined in matrices for each vendor.\n- **Tax Rates:** Different tax rates are applied to each vendor's subtotal.\n- **Total Cost Calculation:** For each vendor, we calculate the subtotal, apply the tax, and add it to the overall total.\n- **Payment Split:** The total amount is split between two payment methods in a specified ratio (60% and 40% in this case).\n\nYou can adjust the product prices, quantities, tax rates, and payment split ratios as needed for your specific scenario."
