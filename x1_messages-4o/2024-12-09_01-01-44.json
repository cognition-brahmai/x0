        "content": "To create a decorator in Python that can be used both with and without parameters, you can use a technique that involves checking if the decorator is being called with a function or another parameter. You can achieve this by defining a function that will be used to handle the different cases.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to make the decorator work both with and without a parameter:\n\n```python\nclass d(object):\n    def __init__(self, fn=None, msg='my default message'):\n        # If the first argument is a function, then we are dealing with a no-parameter decorator\n        if callable(fn):\n            self.fn = fn\n            self.msg = msg\n        else:\n            self.fn = None\n            self.msg = fn if fn is not None else msg\n\n    def __call__(self, fn):\n        # If the function was not set during initialization, set it now\n        if self.fn is None:\n            self.fn = fn\n\n        def newfn(*args, **kwargs):\n            print(self.msg)\n            return self.fn(*args, **kwargs)\n        return newfn\n\n# Using the decorator with a parameter\n@d('This is working')\ndef hello():\n    print('hello world!')\n\n# Using the decorator without a parameter\n@d\ndef too_bad():\n    print('this works too!')\n\n# Call the functions to see the results\nhello()  # Output: This is working\n         #         hello world!\n\ntoo_bad()  # Output: my default message\n           #         this works too!\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - The `__init__` method is modified to accept an optional function (`fn`) and a message (`msg`).\n   - If the `fn` argument is callable (a function), it means the decorator is used without parentheses, and `fn` is assigned to `self.fn`.\n   - Otherwise, `fn` is assumed to be the message, and `self.fn` is initially set to `None`.\n\n2. **Calling**:\n   - The `__call__` method checks if `self.fn` is `None`. If it is, this means that the decorator was used with parameters, and the actual function is passed to `__call__`. Hence, `self.fn` is set to the passed function `fn`.\n   - The `newfn` function wraps the original function and prints the message before executing the function.\n\n3. **Decorator Usage**:\n   - The decorator can now be used both with and without parameters. When used without parameters, it defaults to the specified default message.\n\nBy using this pattern, you ensure that your decorator is flexible and can handle both cases seamlessly."
