        "content": "To write an SQL query that counts the number of countries with a population exceeding 10 billion, you would first need a table that contains country data, including population information. Let's assume you have a table named `countries` with columns `country_name` and `population`. Here's how you can write the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS number_of_countries\nFROM countries\nWHERE population > 10000000000;\n```\n\nThis query selects the count of all countries where the population column value exceeds 10 billion. Note that the number `10000000000` represents 10 billion. Make sure the `population` column data type can accommodate such large numbers, typically `BIGINT` in SQL databases."
