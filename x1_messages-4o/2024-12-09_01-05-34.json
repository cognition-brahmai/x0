        "content": "How can I use Python regex to replace text using a captured group? I want to change the string \"the blue dog and blue cat wore blue hats\" to \"the gray dog and gray cat wore blue hats\". The command I use in `sed` is `echo 'the blue dog and blue cat wore blue hats' | sed 's/blue \\(dog\\|cat\\)/gray \\1/g'`. I tried doing a similar replacement in Python using the following code:\n\n```python\nimport re\ns = \"the blue dog and blue cat wore blue hats\"\np = re.compile(r\"blue (dog|cat)\")\np.sub('gray \\1',s)\n```\n\nBut it gives me an unexpected result: 'the gray \\x01 and gray \\x01 wore blue hats'. How can I correctly accomplish this in Python?"

        "content": "In Python's `re.sub()` method, the replacement string uses `\\1`, `\\2`, etc., to refer to captured groups, but you need to use a different syntax within a string literal. You should use `\\\\1` in the replacement string or use a raw string literal to prevent Python from interpreting `\\1` as an escape sequence.\n\nHere's how you can achieve the desired replacement using Python:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ns = \"the blue dog and blue cat wore blue hats\"\np = re.compile(r\"blue (dog|cat)\")\nresult = p.sub(r'gray \\1', s)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nBy using `r'gray \\1'`, you ensure that the backslash is treated as a literal character, and `\\1` correctly refers to the first captured group. This will give you the expected output:\n\n```\nthe gray dog and gray cat wore blue hats\n```\n\nUsing a raw string (`r''`) for both the pattern and the replacement string is a common practice in Python when dealing with regular expressions to avoid issues with escape sequences."
