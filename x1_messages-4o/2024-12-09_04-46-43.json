        "content": "In Python, dictionary keys must be immutable, which means they cannot be changed after they are created. Since dictionaries are mutable, you cannot directly use them as keys in another dictionary. However, you can create a workaround by using something immutable to represent your dictionary. Here are a few options:\n\n1. **Convert the dictionary to a tuple:**\n   You can convert the key dictionary to a tuple of key-value pairs, which is immutable and can be used as a key.\n\n   ```python\n   # Original dictionary\n   dict_key = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n\n   # Convert to tuple\n   key_as_tuple = tuple(dict_key.items())\n\n   # Use as key in another dictionary\n   main_dict = {key_as_tuple: \"value\"}\n\n   print(main_dict)\n   ```\n\n2. **Use a frozenset:**\n   A `frozenset` is an immutable version of a set, which can also be used as a key if the dictionary keys and values are hashable.\n\n   ```python\n   # Original dictionary\n   dict_key = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n\n   # Convert to frozenset\n   key_as_frozenset = frozenset(dict_key.items())\n\n   # Use as key in another dictionary\n   main_dict = {key_as_frozenset: \"value\"}\n\n   print(main_dict)\n   ```\n\n3. **Stringify the dictionary:**\n   Convert the dictionary to a string representation and use that as a key.\n\n   ```python\n   # Original dictionary\n   dict_key = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n\n   # Convert to string\n   key_as_string = str(dict_key)\n\n   # Use as key in another dictionary\n   main_dict = {key_as_string: \"value\"}\n\n   print(main_dict)\n   ```\n\nEach method has its pros and cons, such as ease of readability and performance implications, so you should choose the one that fits your use case best."
