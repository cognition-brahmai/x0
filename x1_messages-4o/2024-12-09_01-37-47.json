        "content": "Debugging Mako templates can indeed be challenging, especially when it comes to identifying the source of errors in the templates. However, there are several strategies and tools you can use to make the process more manageable:\n\n1. **Enable Debugging Features**:\n   - Mako provides a `strict_undefined` mode, which can help catch undefined variables. You can enable this by setting `strict_undefined=True` when creating your template:\n     ```python\n     from mako.template import Template\n     template = Template(\"<your_template>\", strict_undefined=True)\n     ```\n\n2. **Use the `mako.exceptions` Module**:\n   - Mako has an `exceptions` module that can provide detailed tracebacks. You can use `mako.exceptions.html_error_template()` to render a more informative HTML error page:\n     ```python\n     from mako.template import Template\n     from mako.exceptions import html_error_template\n\n     try:\n         template = Template(\"<your_template>\")\n         print(template.render())\n     except:\n         print(html_error_template().render())\n     ```\n\n3. **Check the Template Syntax**:\n   - Ensure that the syntax of your Mako template is correct. Mako templates use Python-like syntax, but with special tags for control structures (`%`, `${}`, etc.). Double-check that all tags are properly closed and that there are no typos.\n\n4. **Break Down the Template**:\n   - If you're encountering an issue in a large template, try breaking it down into smaller parts. You can isolate sections of the template by commenting out parts and testing each section individually.\n\n5. **Logging**:\n   - Implement logging in your application to capture the input data and the rendered template output. This can help you trace what data is being passed into the template and identify where the issue might be occurring.\n\n6. **Use a Linter**:\n   - There are linters available for Mako templates that can help catch common mistakes and errors. Consider using a tool like `pylint` with a Mako plugin to analyze your templates.\n\n7. **Test with Sample Data**:\n   - Use mock data that closely resembles the real data to test your templates. This can help identify issues with data-dependent logic in the template.\n\nBy using these strategies, you should be able to more effectively debug and resolve issues in your Mako templates without having to manually inspect every line of code."
