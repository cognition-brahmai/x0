I have a string of numbers like '0, 0, 0, 11, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 19, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 11'. I tried iterating over the string and appending each character to a list after converting it to an integer. However, this approach does not work as the string contains spaces and commas. I don't want to remove these characters as they are separating the numbers, for example, '19' should be interpreted as one number, not two separate numbers '1' and '9'. Could you provide a solution for this problem?"

        "content": "To convert a string of numbers separated by spaces and commas into a list of integers in Python, you can use the `split()` method to separate the string into individual elements and then use a list comprehension to convert those elements into integers. Here is a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Use the `replace()` method to remove any spaces that might be surrounding the commas, if necessary.\n2. Use the `split(',')` method to split the string at each comma, creating a list of number strings.\n3. Use a list comprehension to iterate over the split string list and convert each element into an integer.\n\nHere is the complete code:\n\n```python\n# Given string of numbers\nnum_string = '0, 0, 0, 11, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 19, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 11'\n\n# Step 1: Remove any spaces around commas (optional, since split can handle it)\n# num_string = num_string.replace(' ', '')\n\n# Step 2: Split the string by commas\nnum_list_str = num_string.split(',')\n\n# Step 3: Convert each number string to an integer using a list comprehension\nnum_list_int = [int(num.strip()) for num in num_list_str]\n\n# Print the resulting list of integers\nprint(num_list_int)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[0, 0, 0, 11, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 19, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 11]\n```\n\nThis code will correctly parse your string, convert each number to an integer, and handle spaces appropriately by stripping them in the comprehension."
