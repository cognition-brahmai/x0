        "content": "I am currently studying a document about backpropagation and I came across the weight adjustment formula which is stated as: new weight = old weight + learning rate * delta * df(e)/de * input. In this formula, df(e)/de is the derivative of the activation function, commonly a sigmoid function like tanh. I have a few questions about this. What is the purpose of df(e)/de in this formula? Why do we multiply the other factors with df(e)/de? Why is it insufficient to just have learning rate * delta * input?"

        "content": "The purpose of the derivative of the activation function, denoted as \\( \\frac{df(e)}{de} \\), in the weight adjustment formula is to account for the non-linearity introduced by the activation function in a neural network. Here's why it is essential:\n\n1. **Role of Activation Functions**: Activation functions like sigmoid or tanh introduce non-linearity to the model. This non-linearity enables the network to learn complex patterns. However, when we perform backpropagation, we need to understand how a change in the input to an activation function (the weighted sum before activation) affects the output of that activation function.\n\n2. **Chain Rule in Backpropagation**: Backpropagation involves the application of the chain rule of calculus to compute the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight in the network. The chain rule requires us to multiply the derivatives of all functions involved. Here, \\( \\frac{df(e)}{de} \\) is the derivative of the activation function with respect to its input, and it tells us how sensitive the output of the activation function is to changes in its input. This sensitivity needs to be considered when adjusting the weights.\n\n3. **Gradient Scaling**: The derivative \\( \\frac{df(e)}{de} \\) effectively scales the error signal (delta) that is propagated backward through the network. Without this scaling, the adjustments to the weights would not reflect the true impact of changes in weights on the network's output.\n\n4. **Why Not Just Learning Rate * Delta * Input?**: If you omit \\( \\frac{df(e)}{de} \\), you ignore the specific non-linear transformation applied by the activation function. This would lead to incorrect weight updates, as the error gradient would not accurately represent the effect of the weights on the final output. The derivative ensures that the weight updates are proportional to how much a small change in the weight will affect the output error, considering the non-linear transformation.\n\nIn summary, \\( \\frac{df(e)}{de} \\) is crucial for correctly computing gradients in networks with non-linear activation functions, ensuring that weight updates are appropriately scaled and directionally accurate. This allows the neural network to converge to an optimal solution by effectively minimizing the loss function."
