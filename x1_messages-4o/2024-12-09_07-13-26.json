        "content": "The error message you're encountering suggests that there's a mismatch in the data types when you're trying to concatenate or write the elements of `line`. Specifically, it seems like the elements of `line` are NumPy array elements with data type `dtype('S32')`, which indicates that they are byte string (fixed-size string) types, and you're trying to concatenate them using the `+` operator.\n\nTo resolve the issue, you should ensure that each element you are trying to write to the file is converted to a regular Python string. One way to do this is to decode each byte string to a regular string before concatenation. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nname_out = \"histogram_\" + donor + \"_\" + acceptor + \".dat\"\nf = open(name_out, 'w')\nf.write('distance  d.probability  efficiency  e.probability\\n')  # Added newline for proper formatting\nfor line in dist_hist:\n    # Decode each element if they are byte strings\n    str_line = [element.decode() if isinstance(element, bytes) else str(element) for element in line]\n    f.write('  '.join(str_line) + '\\n')  # Join the elements with spaces and add a newline at the end\nf.close()\n\nprint(\"data saved in \" + name_out)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n\n1. **Decoding Byte Strings**: The list comprehension `[element.decode() if isinstance(element, bytes) else str(element) for element in line]` ensures that each element of `line` is a string. If the element is a byte string, it is decoded to a regular string.\n\n2. **Joining Elements**: The elements are joined using `'  '.join(str_line)` which is more efficient and cleaner than manually concatenating with the `+` operator.\n\n3. **Newline Character**: Added `\\n` at the end of the header write operation and each line write operation to ensure each entry is on a new line in your output file.\n\nBy making these changes, your error should be resolved, and the output file should be formatted correctly."
