        "content": "In Python 3, the division operator `/` always performs floating-point division, even when both operands are integers. This is a change from Python 2, where dividing two integers with `/` would perform integer division (also known as floor division), truncating the decimal part and returning an integer.\n\nTo achieve the same behavior as Python 2 in Python 3, where the division of two integers results in an integer, you can use the floor division operator `//`. This operator will divide the numbers and return the largest integer less than or equal to the result. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\n# Example of integer division in Python 3 using //\na = 7\nb = 3\n\n# Integer division\nresult = a // b\nprint(result)  # Output: 2\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you have to use the `/` operator and still want to mimic the behavior of Python 2, you could convert the result to an integer using the `int()` function, but this may not be exactly the same in all cases because it truncates towards zero:\n\n```python\n# Example using normal division and then converting to integer\na = 7\nb = 3\n\n# Division followed by conversion to integer\nresult = int(a / b)\nprint(result)  # Output: 2\n```\n\nUsing `//` is the preferred and more efficient way to ensure integer division in Python 3."
