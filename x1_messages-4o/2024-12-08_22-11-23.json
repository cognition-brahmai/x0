The choices are: \"jumps\", \"hops\", \"skips\", \"scampers\". Once the user selects the correct verb, the program should print out \"Correct!\" and end. If the user selects an incorrect verb, the program should prompt them to try again. Use a while loop and if/else statements to accomplish this."

        "content": "Certainly! Below is a Python program that prompts the user to choose the appropriate verb for the sentence \"The squirrel _____ through the trees\" using a while loop and if/else statements:\n\n```python\ndef choose_verb():\n    correct_verb = \"scampers\"\n    choices = [\"jumps\", \"hops\", \"skips\", \"scampers\"]\n\n    print(\"Complete the sentence: 'The squirrel _____ through the trees'\")\n    print(\"Choose the correct verb from the following options:\")\n    for i, choice in enumerate(choices, 1):\n        print(f\"{i}. {choice}\")\n\n    while True:\n        try:\n            user_choice = int(input(\"Enter the number corresponding to your choice: \"))\n            if user_choice < 1 or user_choice > len(choices):\n                print(\"Please choose a number between 1 and 4.\")\n                continue\n\n            selected_verb = choices[user_choice - 1]\n            if selected_verb == correct_verb:\n                print(\"Correct!\")\n                break\n            else:\n                print(\"Incorrect. Try again.\")\n        except ValueError:\n            print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a number between 1 and 4.\")\n\nchoose_verb()\n```\n\n### How It Works:\n1. The program defines a function `choose_verb` that contains the logic for the task.\n2. It sets `correct_verb` to \"scampers\".\n3. It lists the possible `choices`.\n4. It uses a `while` loop to continuously prompt the user for input until the correct choice is made.\n5. The `try-except` block handles any non-integer inputs to prevent the program from crashing.\n6. If the user selects the correct verb, the program prints \"Correct!\" and exits the loop.\n7. If the user selects an incorrect verb, the program prompts them to try again."
