        "content": "Creating a visual representation of a computer system's architecture in Swift can be an interesting project, especially if you're looking to illustrate the flow of data and interactions between components. You can achieve this by using SwiftUI for the UI and Core Graphics for drawing custom graphics. Here\u2019s a simplified example of how you might implement such a function:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide:\n\n1. **Define the Components and Data Flow:**\n   Create a model to represent the components and their interactions.\n\n2. **Create a View to Draw the Components:**\n   Use SwiftUI to create a view that renders each component and the connections between them.\n\n3. **Animate the Data Flow:**\n   Use SwiftUI\u2019s animation capabilities to demonstrate the flow of data.\n\n### Example Code:\n\n```swift\nimport SwiftUI\n\n// Model to represent a component\nstruct Component: Identifiable {\n    let id = UUID()\n    let name: String\n    let position: CGPoint\n}\n\n// Model to represent a connection between components\nstruct Connection {\n    let from: Component\n    let to: Component\n}\n\n// SwiftUI View\nstruct SystemArchitectureView: View {\n    @State private var components: [Component] = [\n        Component(name: \"CPU\", position: CGPoint(x: 100, y: 100)),\n        Component(name: \"GPU\", position: CGPoint(x: 300, y: 100)),\n        Component(name: \"RAM\", position: CGPoint(x: 200, y: 300))\n    ]\n    \n    @State private var connections: [Connection] = []\n\n    var body: some View {\n        ZStack {\n            // Draw connections\n            ForEach(connections, id: \\.from.id) { connection in\n                Path { path in\n                    path.move(to: connection.from.position)\n                    path.addLine(to: connection.to.position)\n                }\n                .stroke(Color.blue, lineWidth: 2)\n                .animation(.easeInOut(duration: 2))\n            }\n            \n            // Draw components\n            ForEach(components) { component in\n                Text(component.name)\n                    .position(component.position)\n                    .padding()\n                    .background(Color.gray)\n                    .cornerRadius(10)\n            }\n        }\n        .onAppear {\n            // Define connections with some delay to animate\n            DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 1) {\n                self.connections.append(\n                    Connection(from: self.components[0], to: self.components[1])\n                )\n                self.connections.append(\n                    Connection(from: self.components[1], to: self.components[2])\n                )\n                self.connections.append(\n                    Connection(from: self.components[2], to: self.components[0])\n                )\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Preview\nstruct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {\n    static var previews: some View {\n        SystemArchitectureView()\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Components**: Defined using a `Component` struct with a name and position.\n- **Connections**: Represented by drawing lines between component positions using `Path`.\n- **Animation**: Connections are animated to appear after a delay using `DispatchQueue`.\n\nThis example provides a basic framework. You can expand it by adding more components, interactions, colors, and more complex animations to enhance the visualization. SwiftUI provides a robust framework for creating dynamic and interactive UIs, making it ideal for such applications."
