        "content": "To solve this puzzle, let's denote the original 4-digit number as \\( abcd \\), where \\( a, b, c, \\) and \\( d \\) are distinct digits from 1 to 9, and it is multiplied by 4 to give \\( dcba \\).\n\nWe have the equation:\n\n\\[ 4 \\times (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) = 1000d + 100c + 10b + a \\]\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n\\[ 4000a + 400b + 40c + 4d = 1000d + 100c + 10b + a \\]\n\nRearranging terms:\n\n\\[ 3999a + 390b - 60c - 996d = 0 \\]\n\nThis can be simplified by dividing the entire equation by 3:\n\n\\[ 1333a + 130b - 20c - 332d = 0 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find distinct integers \\( a, b, c, \\) and \\( d \\) from 1 to 9 that satisfy this equation.\n\nTo find a solution, consider the fact that \\( abcd \\) is a 4-digit number and multiplying by 4 results in another 4-digit number, \\( dcba \\). Therefore, \\( a \\) should be small enough so that multiplying by 4 doesn\u2019t exceed 9 as the last digit in \\( dcba \\). \n\nLet's try some possible values for \\( a \\):\n\n- If \\( a = 2 \\), \\( abcd \\times 4 \\) would result in \\( dcba \\) being an 8xxx number, which can't happen as \\( a \\) should be less than 3.\n\n- If \\( a = 1 \\), then \\( abcd \\times 4 \\) results in \\( dcba \\) being a 4xxx number.\n\nLet's verify for \\( a = 2 \\):\n\nIf \\( a = 2 \\):\n\n\\[ 1333(2) + 130b - 20c - 332d = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ 2666 + 130b - 20c - 332d = 0 \\]\n\nNow, let's assume \\( d = 8 \\) since it should be larger to account for the multiplication by 4:\n\n\\[ 2666 + 130b - 20c - 2656 = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ 10 + 130b - 20c = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ 130b = 20c - 10 \\]\n\n\\[ 13b = 2c - 1 \\]\n\nTrying values for \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) that satisfy distinct digits:\n\n- If \\( b = 7 \\), then:\n\n\\[ 13(7) = 2c - 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 91 = 2c - 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 2c = 92 \\]\n\n\\[ c = 46 \\] \n\nThis doesn't work. Let's try \\( b = 9 \\):\n\n- If \\( b = 9 \\), then:\n\n\\[ 13(9) = 2c - 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 117 = 2c - 1 \\]\n\n\\[ 2c = 118 \\]\n\n\\[ c = 59 \\]\n\nThis is impossible because digits range from 1 to 9. \n\nContinuing with logical reasoning and checking for small numbers, it turns out that the only solution with distinct digits and \\( a = 2 \\) that works is:\n\n- If \\( a = 2 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), \\( c = 7 \\), \\( d = 8 \\).\n\nThe number is 2178, and:\n\n\\[ 4 \\times 2178 = 8712 \\]\n\nThus, the original number is **2178**."
