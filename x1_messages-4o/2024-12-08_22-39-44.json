Chocolate is not a typical ingredient in this savory dish.\n\n2. **Greek Salad**: A traditional Greek salad includes ingredients such as tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, feta cheese, and onions. Chocolate does not feature in this salad, which focuses on fresh vegetables and a tangy dressing.\n\n3. **Caprese Salad**: This Italian-inspired salad is made with fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, basil, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar. The emphasis is on the freshness of the produce, and chocolate is not a part of this flavor profile.\n\nThese salads are known for their specific combinations of ingredients that do not include chocolate, which tends to be more associated with desserts rather than savory salads."
