However, my function does not work as expected. For example, when I call `oneDArray([1,[2,2,2],4])`, I want the output to be `[1,2,2,2,4]`, but it does not work correctly. On the other hand, when I call `oneDArray([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])`, it works perfectly and returns `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`. Why does my code work for the second case and not the first one? How can I modify my function so it works for the first case as well?\n\nHere is my current code:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef oneDArray(x):\n    return list(itertools.chain(*x))\n```"

        "content": "The issue with your code arises because the `itertools.chain` function with the unpacking operator `*` works well when all elements of the input list are iterable. In the case of `oneDArray([1,[2,2,2],4])`, the first and last elements are not iterable, which causes the `chain` function to fail.\n\nTo solve this problem, you need to account for elements that may not be lists and ensure that you flatten the entire structure, regardless of its depth. One way to do this is to write a recursive function that processes each element and flattens it if it's a list. Here is a modified version of your function that should work for both cases:\n\n```python\ndef oneDArray(x):\n    result = []\n    for item in x:\n        if isinstance(item, list):\n            result.extend(oneDArray(item))\n        else:\n            result.append(item)\n    return result\n\n# Test cases\nprint(oneDArray([1, [2, 2, 2], 4]))  # Output: [1, 2, 2, 2, 4]\nprint(oneDArray([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The function `oneDArray` now checks if each element in the input list `x` is itself a list.\n- If it is a list, the function calls itself recursively to flatten that sublist and extends the result list with the flattened elements.\n- If an element is not a list, it simply appends the element to the result list.\n- This approach ensures that all nested lists, regardless of depth, are flattened into a single list."
