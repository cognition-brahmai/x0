        "content": "To improve the accessibility of the Gucci website based on the evaluation results, the following specific changes can be made:\n\n1. **Missing Alt Attribute on Images (8 occurrences):**\n   - Ensure all images have descriptive `alt` attributes. This helps screen readers convey the content and purpose of images to users with visual impairments.\n   - Example: `<img src=\"image.jpg\" alt=\"A Gucci handbag in black leather\">`\n\n2. **Empty Link Text (4 occurrences):**\n   - Provide clear and descriptive text for all links. Avoid using generic terms like \"click here.\"\n   - Example: Instead of `<a href=\"product.html\"></a>`, use `<a href=\"product.html\">View the Gucci handbag collection</a>`\n\n3. **Missing Form Label (2 occurrences):**\n   - Ensure that all form fields have associated labels using the `<label>` element, which should be linked to the corresponding input element by the `for` attribute.\n   - Example: \n     ```html\n     <label for=\"email\">Email Address:</label>\n     <input type=\"email\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\">\n     ```\n\n4. **Contrast Ratio Below 4.5:1 (6 occurrences):**\n   - Improve text and background color combinations to meet the minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text. Use tools like contrast checkers to identify problematic areas.\n   - Example: If the text is light gray on a white background, consider using a darker gray to increase contrast.\n\n5. **Empty Button Link Text (1 occurrence):**\n   - Ensure all buttons have meaningful text to describe their function, making it clear what action will occur when clicked.\n   - Example: Instead of `<button></button>`, use `<button>Submit Order</button>`\n\nImplementing these changes will enhance the website's accessibility, making it more inclusive for users with disabilities. Additionally, it's a good practice to regularly test and review the website's accessibility to ensure compliance with the latest standards and guidelines."
