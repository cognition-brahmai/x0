Remember, your poem must follow the traditional 5-7-5 syllable structure and use words that invoke the essence of both springtime and Ikebana. To make it a bit more challenging, try incorporating a reference to the number of petals on a specific flower commonly used in Ikebana arrangements. Good luck!"
