        "content": "The error you're encountering is a common one when trying to send emails using Gmail's SMTP server. It generally relates to security settings on the Gmail account you're trying to use. Here are some steps you can follow to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Enable Less Secure Apps:**\n   - Although you mentioned you've enabled low security apps, ensure it's still enabled. Sometimes settings can revert.\n   - Visit: [Less secure apps & your Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps) and ensure it's turned on.\n\n2. **Use App Passwords:**\n   - If you have Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) enabled on your Gmail account, you cannot use your regular password. Instead, you'll need to create an App Password.\n   - Go to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) > App Passwords, and generate a new app password for the email client.\n   - Replace `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` with this app password.\n\n3. **Unlock Captcha:**\n   - Visit [Display Unlock Captcha](https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha) and click \u201cContinue\u201d to allow access to your Gmail account.\n\n4. **Review and Update Your `settings.py`:**\n   - Ensure your `EMAIL_BACKEND` is correct. If you're using SSL, you should use:\n     ```python\n     EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'\n     EMAIL_USE_SSL = True\n     ```\n   - Ensure your email settings are properly set:\n     ```python\n     EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'\n     EMAIL_PORT = 465\n     EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'sarath4coding@gmail.com'\n     EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your_app_password_here'  # Use the App Password if 2FA is enabled\n     EMAIL_USE_SSL = True\n     ```\n\n5. **Check Your Network and Firewall:**\n   - Ensure that your server or local environment allows outgoing connections on port 465. Sometimes network restrictions can block these ports.\n\n6. **Verify Django and Python Versions:**\n   - Make sure your Django and Python environments are compatible and properly configured. Django 1.8 is quite old and might have compatibility issues with newer Python versions.\n\n7. **Testing with Different Email Clients:**\n   - As a troubleshooting step, try sending an email using the Gmail account with a different client or script to confirm that the issue is specific to your Django application.\n\nIf after following these steps you're still facing issues, consider using a different email service, like SendGrid or Mailgun, which might offer easier integration with Django and less stringent security requirements."
