        "content": "How do I pass parameters with an SQL query in Pandas? I am using an SQLAlchemy engine to connect to a PostgreSQL database. I've been able to successfully pass parameters as a list using the following code:\n\n```python\ndf = psql.read_sql(('select \"Timestamp\",\"Value\" from \"MyTable\" '\n                     'where \"Timestamp\" BETWEEN %s AND %s'),\n                   db,params=[datetime(2014,6,24,16,0),datetime(2014,6,24,17,0)],\n                   index_col=['Timestamp'])\n```\n\nHowever, according to the Pandas documentation, I should also be able to pass parameters as a dictionary. I've tried implementing this as follows, but it doesn't seem to work:\n\n```python\ndf = psql.read_sql(('select \"Timestamp\",\"Value\" from \"MyTable\" '\n                     'where \"Timestamp\" BETWEEN :dstart AND :dfinish'),\n                   db,params={\"dstart\":datetime(2014,6,24,16,0),\"dfinish\":datetime(2014,6,24,17,0)},\n                   index_col=['Timestamp'])\n```\n\nWhat is the recommended way of running these types of queries from Pandas?"

        "content": "When using SQLAlchemy with Pandas to pass parameters as a dictionary, it's important to ensure that the SQL query syntax and parameter binding are correctly aligned with SQLAlchemy's expectations. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Ensure you're using the correct placeholder syntax**: When passing parameters as a dictionary, use `:param_name` for placeholders in your query, which you've already done correctly.\n\n2. **Verify your SQLAlchemy connection**: Make sure your `db` variable is indeed an SQLAlchemy engine or connection object.\n\n3. **Debug any potential issues**: If you're still encountering issues, ensure that the datetime objects are being correctly interpreted by the database. You can use `print` statements to check the values being passed.\n\nHere's a working example based on your setup:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Assuming `db` is your SQLAlchemy engine or connection\n# db = create_engine('postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/mydatabase')\n\nquery = '''\n    SELECT \"Timestamp\", \"Value\" FROM \"MyTable\"\n    WHERE \"Timestamp\" BETWEEN :dstart AND :dfinish\n'''\n\nparams = {\n    \"dstart\": datetime(2014, 6, 24, 16, 0),\n    \"dfinish\": datetime(2014, 6, 24, 17, 0)\n}\n\n# Use read_sql_query instead of read_sql for clarity\ndf = pd.read_sql_query(query, db, params=params, index_col='Timestamp')\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\n**Troubleshooting Tips**:\n\n- **Check the SQLAlchemy version**: Make sure your SQLAlchemy version supports named parameters. You can do this by running `pip show sqlalchemy`.\n\n- **Check the database compatibility**: Ensure that your PostgreSQL database can handle the datetime format being sent. Sometimes, explicit casting might be needed.\n\n- **Inspect error messages**: If the code doesn't work, look closely at the error messages which might provide more insights into what could be going wrong.\n\nBy ensuring these steps, you should be able to pass parameters as a dictionary successfully."
