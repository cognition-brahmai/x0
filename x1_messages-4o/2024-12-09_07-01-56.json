However, when attempting to change the 'hour' attribute of the 'tomorrow' object I get an AttributeError that states 'datetime.datetime' objects are not writable. How can I either modify the 'hour' attribute or get a 'datetime' object for 12:00 the following day?\n\nHere is my current code:\n\n```python\ntoday_time = datetime.datetime.now()\ntomorrow = today_time + datetime.timedelta(days = 1)\ntomorrow.hour = 12\nresult = (tomorrow-today_time).total_seconds()\n```\n\nThe error I receive is:\n\n```python\nAttributeError: attribute 'hour' of 'datetime.datetime' objects is not writable\n```"

        "content": "In Python, `datetime.datetime` objects are immutable, meaning you cannot modify their attributes directly. Instead, you can create a new `datetime` object with the desired modifications using the `replace()` method. Here's how you can achieve your goal of calculating the seconds between the current time and 12:00 noon the following day:\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\n# Get the current time\ntoday_time = datetime.datetime.now()\n\n# Calculate the same time tomorrow\ntomorrow = today_time + datetime.timedelta(days=1)\n\n# Create a new datetime object for 12:00 the following day\ntomorrow_noon = tomorrow.replace(hour=12, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)\n\n# Calculate the difference in seconds\nresult = (tomorrow_noon - today_time).total_seconds()\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- We calculate `tomorrow` by adding one day to the current time.\n- We then use the `replace()` method to create a `tomorrow_noon` object with the time set to 12:00 (noon) on the next day.\n- Finally, we calculate the difference in seconds between `tomorrow_noon` and `today_time`."
