The first one is a setuptools package (not uploaded to any online repository) and the second one is a simple python script with two modules. The second project is configured to use a dedicated virtualenv. When I install the first project in the virtualenv, PyCharm shows an error \"No module named p\" for import statements in the second project, even though the script runs fine. Is there a way to configure PyCharm to recognize modules installed in development mode?\n\nThe structure of the first project is as follows:\n```\np/\n|\n+- p/\n|  |\n|  +- __init__.py\n|  +- other subpackages, modules, etc.\n+- setup.py\n+- README, DESCRIPTION, setup.cfg, etc.\n```\nWhen I configure the PyCharm project to live in its own virtualenv and install it there in development mode, everything works fine.\n\nI recently installed another package from pypi via PyCharm, following which PyCharm started recognizing the package installed by python3 setup.py develop. It seems like PyCharm was not in sync with some cache. Can PyCharm be told to update its caches regarding the used python environment?"

        "content": "PyCharm can sometimes have issues recognizing packages installed in development mode, particularly if there have been recent changes to the environment or the setup. Here are a few steps you can take to ensure PyCharm correctly recognizes your installed packages:\n\n1. **Invalidate Caches/Restart**: PyCharm has a built-in option to clear its caches, which can often resolve issues with code recognition. You can do this by going to `File` > `Invalidate Caches / Restart...` and choosing to invalidate and restart. This will refresh PyCharm's understanding of the project environment.\n\n2. **Check Interpreter Settings**: Ensure that the virtual environment where you installed your package is set as the Python interpreter for the project. Go to `File` > `Settings` (or `PyCharm` > `Preferences` on macOS) > `Project: <project_name>` > `Python Interpreter`. Make sure the correct virtual environment is selected.\n\n3. **Reinstall in Development Mode**: Sometimes, simply reinstalling the package in development mode can help. Navigate to the root directory of your first project and run:\n   ```bash\n   python3 setup.py develop\n   ```\n   This ensures the package is linked correctly.\n\n4. **Synchronize the Virtual Environment**: If you manually installed a package or made changes outside of PyCharm, you can synchronize the virtual environment. In the Python Interpreter settings, there's an option to \"Synchronize Packages,\" which may help PyCharm recognize the changes.\n\n5. **Mark Source Directories**: Ensure that the source directories of your package are marked correctly. Right-click on the `p` directory in the project view and select `Mark Directory as` > `Sources Root`. This helps PyCharm understand where to look for modules.\n\n6. **Check Import Statements**: Double-check the import statements in your second project. If your package is structured as `p`, your import statements should reflect the correct structure, such as `from p import module_name`.\n\n7. **Rebuild Project**: If none of the above works, try rebuilding the project. This can be done by selecting `Build` > `Rebuild Project` from the menu.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with PyCharm not recognizing modules installed in development mode. If the problem persists, it might be worth checking for any PyCharm updates or considering reporting the issue to JetBrains' support."
