The program should continue asking the user for guesses until they correctly guess the number, at which point the program should print out how many guesses it took the user to get it right."

        "content": "Certainly! For a science fiction novel that fits your description, I suggest \"The Hunger Games\" by Suzanne Collins. It's set in a dystopian future where the United States has been replaced by the nation of Panem, which consists of a wealthy Capitol and twelve poorer districts. The story explores themes of social class division, oppression, and survival.\n\nNow, for the Java code that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and allows the user to guess it:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Random;\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class GuessingGame {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Random random = new Random();\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        \n        int randomNumber = random.nextInt(100) + 1; // Generates a number between 1 and 100\n        int guess;\n        int numberOfGuesses = 0;\n        \n        System.out.println(\"Welcome to the Guessing Game!\");\n        System.out.println(\"I have selected a number between 1 and 100. Try to guess it!\");\n\n        do {\n            System.out.print(\"Enter your guess: \");\n            guess = scanner.nextInt();\n            numberOfGuesses++;\n\n            if (guess < randomNumber) {\n                System.out.println(\"Too low! Try again.\");\n            } else if (guess > randomNumber) {\n                System.out.println(\"Too high! Try again.\");\n            } else {\n                System.out.println(\"Congratulations! You've guessed the number correctly.\");\n                System.out.println(\"It took you \" + numberOfGuesses + \" guesses.\");\n            }\n        } while (guess != randomNumber);\n\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis Java program will keep prompting the user for guesses until they correctly guess the randomly generated number. Once they do, it will display the number of attempts it took to arrive at the correct answer."
