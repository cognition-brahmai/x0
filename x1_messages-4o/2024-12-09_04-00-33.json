        "content": "I'm encountering a \"Read-only file system\" error in my AWS Lambda function when I attempt to download a file from an S3 bucket. My function is triggered when I drop a 'file.csv' into the bucket. Despite the file not being large, and even after introducing a 60-second pause before opening the file for reading, I still face the issue. For some reason, an extra \".6CEdFe7C\" is appended to the filename. The original file name is \"file.csv\" but when the s3.download_file method tries to download, it attempts to download \"file.csv.6CEdFe7C\". Why is this happening and how can I fix it? Here is the error:\n\n```python\n[Errno 30] Read-only file system: u'/file.csv.6CEdFe7C': IOError\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"/var/task/lambda_function.py\", line 75, in lambda_handler\ns3.download_file(bucket, key, filepath)\nFile \"/var/runtime/boto3/s3/inject.py\", line 104, in download_file\nextra_args=ExtraArgs, callback=Callback)\nFile \"/var/runtime/boto3/s3/transfer.py\", line 670, in download_file\nextra_args, callback)\nFile \"/var/runtime/boto3/s3/transfer.py\", line 685, in _download_file\nself._get_object(bucket, key, filename, extra_args, callback)\nFile \"/var/runtime/boto3/s3/transfer.py\", line 709, in _get_object\nextra_args, callback)\nFile \"/var/runtime/boto3/s3/transfer.py\", line 723, in _do_get_object\nwith self._osutil.open(filename, 'wb') as f:\nFile \"/var/runtime/boto3/s3/transfer.py\", line 332, in open\nreturn open(filename, mode)\nIOError: [Errno 30] Read-only file system: u'/file.csv.6CEdFe7C'\n```\n\nAnd here is my code:\n\n```python\ndef lambda_handler(event, context):\n\n    s3_response = {}\n    counter = 0\n    event_records = event.get(\"Records\", [])\n\n    s3_items = []\n    for event_record in event_records:\n        if \"s3\" in event_record:\n            bucket = event_record[\"s3\"][\"bucket\"][\"name\"]\n            key = event_record[\"s3\"][\"object\"][\"key\"]\n            filepath = '/' + key\n            print(bucket)\n            print(key)\n            print(filepath)\n            s3.download_file(bucket, key, filepath)\n```"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"[Errno 30] Read-only file system,\" is due to the fact that AWS Lambda functions have a read-only filesystem, except for the `/tmp` directory, which provides a writable space up to 512 MB. The issue with the filename \"file.csv.6CEdFe7C\" being appended is likely due to the nature of the temporary files created by the S3 download process or an artifact of the transfer mechanism.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this:\n\n1. **Use the `/tmp` Directory**: Modify your code to download the file into the `/tmp` directory instead of the root directory.\n\n2. **Check the Key for URL Encoding**: Ensure that the key does not have URL encoded characters that could be causing a change in the filename.\n\nHere's how you can update your code:\n\n```python\nimport boto3\n\ns3 = boto3.client('s3')\n\ndef lambda_handler(event, context):\n    s3_response = {}\n    counter = 0\n    event_records = event.get(\"Records\", [])\n\n    for event_record in event_records:\n        if \"s3\" in event_record:\n            bucket = event_record[\"s3\"][\"bucket\"][\"name\"]\n            key = event_record[\"s3\"][\"object\"][\"key\"]\n\n            # Use /tmp directory for writing files\n            filepath = '/tmp/' + key.split('/')[-1]  # Extracts the filename from the key\n            print(f\"Bucket: {bucket}\")\n            print(f\"Key: {key}\")\n            print(f\"Filepath: {filepath}\")\n\n            # Download the file to the /tmp directory\n            s3.download_file(bucket, key, filepath)\n\n            # Process the file as needed\n            # ...\n\n            # Optionally, clean up the file after processing\n            # import os\n            # os.remove(filepath)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Use `/tmp`**: Always use the `/tmp` directory for downloading or writing files in AWS Lambda.\n- **Filename Handling**: Ensure that the filename is correctly parsed from the S3 key to avoid any unwanted characters or suffixes.\n- **Cleanup**: Consider cleaning up any temporary files if they are no longer needed after processing, especially if you have multiple invocations and large files.\n\nThis should resolve the read-only file system error and the issue with the appended filename."
