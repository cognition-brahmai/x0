        "content": "Certainly! Below is a simple Python code that calculates the cost of a journey based on the distance traveled, fuel consumption rate, and fuel price per unit:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_journey_cost(distance, fuel_consumption, fuel_price):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the cost of a journey.\n\n    :param distance: The distance of the journey in kilometers (km).\n    :param fuel_consumption: The fuel consumption rate in liters per 100 kilometers (L/100km).\n    :param fuel_price: The price of fuel per liter in your currency.\n    :return: The total cost of the journey.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the total fuel needed for the journey\n    total_fuel_needed = (distance / 100) * fuel_consumption\n    \n    # Calculate the total cost of the journey\n    total_cost = total_fuel_needed * fuel_price\n\n    return total_cost\n\n# Example usage:\ndistance = 250  # kilometers\nfuel_consumption = 8  # liters per 100 kilometers\nfuel_price = 1.5  # currency units per liter\n\ncost = calculate_journey_cost(distance, fuel_consumption, fuel_price)\nprint(f\"The total cost of the journey is: {cost:.2f} currency units.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Distance**: The total distance of the journey in kilometers.\n2. **Fuel Consumption**: The vehicle's fuel consumption rate in liters per 100 kilometers.\n3. **Fuel Price**: The cost of fuel per liter.\n\nThe function calculates the total amount of fuel required for the journey and multiplies it by the price of the fuel to get the total cost. You can replace the example values with your actual data to get the result for your specific journey."
