Now, regardless of the project I'm working on, I get this error. The output I'm seeing is as follows:\n\n```\n& : File C:\\Users\\pc\\Documents\\python\\venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is \ndisabled on this system.

        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to PowerShell's execution policy, which is a security feature designed to control the conditions under which PowerShell loads configuration files and runs scripts. By default, the execution policy is set to \"Restricted,\" which prevents any scripts from running.\n\nTo resolve this issue and enable the activation of your Python virtual environment using the `Activate.ps1` script, you can adjust the execution policy. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator:**\n   - Press `Win` + `X` and select \"Windows PowerShell (Admin)\" or \"Terminal (Admin)\" if you're using Windows 11.\n\n2. **Check the Current Execution Policy:**\n   - Run the following command to see your current execution policy:\n     ```powershell\n     Get-ExecutionPolicy\n     ```\n   - It will likely return `Restricted` or `RemoteSigned`.\n\n3. **Change the Execution Policy:**\n   - To allow local scripts to run, you can set the execution policy to `RemoteSigned`. This means scripts created locally can run, but those downloaded from the internet must be signed by a trusted publisher.\n   - Run the following command:\n     ```powershell\n     Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned\n     ```\n   - If prompted, type `Y` to confirm the change.\n\n4. **Verify the Change:**\n   - You can verify that the execution policy has been updated by running:\n     ```powershell\n     Get-ExecutionPolicy\n     ```\n   - It should now return `RemoteSigned`.\n\n5. **Try Activating Your Virtual Environment Again:**\n   - Navigate to your project folder in PowerShell and try activating your virtual environment again with:\n     ```powershell\n     & C:\\Users\\pc\\Documents\\python\\venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1\n     ```\n\n6. **If You Prefer a Less Permanent Change:**\n   - You can bypass the execution policy for a single session by using the `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` parameter when starting PowerShell:\n     ```powershell\n     powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File \"C:\\Users\\pc\\Documents\\python\\venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1\"\n     ```\n\nRemember that changing the execution policy affects the security of your system. It's generally safe to set it to `RemoteSigned`, but if you're in a highly secure environment or on a shared machine, consider reverting to the original policy after you've done your work. You can do this by changing the policy back to `Restricted` or `AllSigned` using the `Set-ExecutionPolicy` command."
