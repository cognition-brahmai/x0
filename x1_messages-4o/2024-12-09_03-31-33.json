I attempted to use 'span[class=title] a::text' as my selector but it only returns the text inside the anchor tag. I want to retrieve the link inside the href attribute.\n\nHere's the html I'm working with:\n```html\n<span class=\"title\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.example.com\"></a>\n</span>\n```\n\nAnd here's the code I tried:\n```python\nLink = Link1.css('span[class=title] a::text').extract()[0]\n```"

        "content": "To extract the `href` attribute from an anchor tag using Scrapy with CSS selectors, you should use `::attr(attribute_name)` instead of `::text`, which is used for extracting the text content. In your case, you want to extract the value of the `href` attribute.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nlink = Link1.css('span.title a::attr(href)').extract_first()\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the selector:\n\n- `span.title a`: This selects the `<a>` tag that is a descendant of a `<span>` tag with the class `title`.\n- `::attr(href)`: This extracts the value of the `href` attribute from the selected `<a>` tag.\n- `extract_first()`: This method extracts the first matching item, which is useful if you expect only one `<a>` tag within the `<span>`.\n\nThis should give you the URL `https://www.example.com` as the result."
