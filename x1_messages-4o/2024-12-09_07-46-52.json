        "content": "To list the dependencies for a specific package using pip, you can use the `pip show` command followed by the package name. This command provides detailed information about the package, including its dependencies. Here's how you do it:\n\n1. Open your command line or terminal.\n2. Run the following command, replacing `package-name` with the name of the package you're interested in:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip show package-name\n   ```\n\n3. Look for the \"Requires\" section in the output. This section lists the dependencies of the specified package.\n\nFor example, if you want to find the dependencies for a package named `requests`, you would run:\n\n```bash\npip show requests\n```\n\nThis will display information about the `requests` package, including its dependencies.\n\nKeep in mind that this will only show direct dependencies, not the entire dependency tree. If you need to see the full dependency tree, you might consider using a tool like `pipdeptree`, which can be installed via pip:\n\n```bash\npip install pipdeptree\n```\n\nAnd then run:\n\n```bash\npipdeptree -p package-name\n```\n\nThis will give you a detailed view of the package's dependency tree."
