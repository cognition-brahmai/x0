Here's how you can do it:\n\n```bash\ngit ls-files | xargs cat | wc -l\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`git ls-files`:** This command lists all the files tracked by the repository. It outputs the file names, one per line.\n\n2. **`xargs cat`:** `xargs` takes the output from `git ls-files` and passes it as arguments to `cat`. This effectively concatenates all the files together.\n\n3. **`wc -l`:** This command counts the number of lines in the concatenated output from `cat`.\n\nThis will give you the total number of lines across all files tracked by the Git repository. Note that this approach will only consider files tracked by Git and will not include untracked or ignored files."
