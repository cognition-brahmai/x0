I am converting these numbers into floats using `float()`, and raising a `ValueError` if it fails. These floats are then stored in a list. When I print the list, I want the numbers to have 2 decimal places. For example, I have a text file with the numbers `-3.65, 9.17, 1`. After converting them to floats and appending them to a list, Python 2 returns `float(-3.65)` as `-3.65`. However, in Python 3, `float(-3.65)` returns `-3.6499999999999999`, losing its precision. How can I print the list of floats as `[-3.6499999999999999, 9.1699999999999999, 1.0]` with only 2 decimal points? I've tried `'%.1f' % round(n, 1)` which returns a string. Is there a way to return a list of all floats with two decimal points, and not strings? I've also tried rounding using `[round(num, 2) for num in list]` but I need to set the decimal points / precision instead of using `round()`."

        "content": "To ensure that your list of floats is displayed with two decimal places, you can use Python's string formatting capabilities when printing the list, without changing the underlying data type from float to string. The `round()` function is appropriate for rounding, but if you want to control the display of decimal places without altering the float precision itself, you can achieve this using formatted string literals or the `format()` method.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using Formatted String Literals (f-strings, Python 3.6+)**:\n   You can format each number in the list to have two decimal places when printing.\n\n   ```python\n   float_list = [-3.65, 9.17, 1.0]\n   formatted_list = [f\"{num:.2f}\" for num in float_list]\n   print(formatted_list)\n   ```\n\n   This will output:\n   ```\n   ['-3.65', '9.17', '1.00']\n   ```\n\n   Note: This will still result in a list of strings, but each number is formatted to two decimal places.\n\n2. **Using `format()` method**:\n   You can also use the `format()` method to achieve similar results:\n\n   ```python\n   float_list = [-3.65, 9.17, 1.0]\n   formatted_list = [\"{:.2f}\".format(num) for num in float_list]\n   print(formatted_list)\n   ```\n\n   This will output the same as above.\n\n3. **For Display Purposes Only**:\n   If you want to maintain them as floats but format them only during display, you can apply the formatting directly in the print statement:\n\n   ```python\n   float_list = [-3.65, 9.17, 1.0]\n   print([f\"{num:.2f}\" for num in float_list])\n   ```\n\n   Again, this will produce a list of strings, but it ensures when you display the numbers, they appear with two decimal places.\n\nIf you specifically need them to remain as floats but be rounded to two decimal places, you should stick with rounding them using `round(num, 2)`. However, when you print them, you'll need to format the output to ensure two decimal places are shown, as demonstrated.\n\nIt's important to understand that floats inherently have precision issues due to their binary representation, which is why you see those extended decimals. The above solutions help in controlling how they are displayed."
