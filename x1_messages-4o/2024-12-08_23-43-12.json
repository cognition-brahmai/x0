        "content": "Web developers are responsible for designing, building, and maintaining websites. Their tasks include writing code, designing user interfaces, ensuring site functionality, and troubleshooting issues. Python, although not traditionally associated with front-end web development (which commonly uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), is extensively used in back-end development due to its simplicity and efficiency.\n\nHere's a brief overview of a web developer's tasks with Python code examples:\n\n1. **Creating and maintaining websites**: Web developers often use frameworks to build web applications. In Python, frameworks like Django and Flask are popular.\n\n   - **Django**: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.\n\n     ```python\n     # Example of a simple Django model\n     from django.db import models\n\n     class Article(models.Model):\n         title = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n         content = models.TextField()\n         pub_date = models.DateTimeField('date published')\n     ```\n\n   - **Flask**: A micro web framework for Python, which is lightweight and easy to use.\n\n     ```python\n     # Example of a simple Flask application\n     from flask import Flask\n\n     app = Flask(__name__)\n\n     @app.route('/')\n     def hello_world():\n         return 'Hello, World!'\n     ```\n\n2. **Writing server-side logic**: Python is used to handle server-side logic, such as handling requests and connecting to databases.\n\n   ```python\n   # Using Flask to handle a POST request\n   from flask import request\n\n   @app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])\n   def submit():\n       data = request.form['data']\n       # Process data\n       return 'Data received!'\n   ```\n\n3. **Working with databases**: Python can interact with databases using libraries like SQLAlchemy (an ORM for database operations) or directly using database connectors.\n\n   ```python\n   # Using SQLAlchemy to define a database model\n   from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String\n   from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\n\n   Base = declarative_base()\n\n   class User(Base):\n       __tablename__ = 'users'\n       id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n       name = Column(String)\n\n   engine = create_engine('sqlite:///users.db')\n   Base.metadata.create_all(engine)\n   ```\n\n4. **Troubleshooting and testing**: Python developers often write tests for their code using libraries like `unittest` or `pytest`.\n\n   ```python\n   # A simple test using unittest\n   import unittest\n\n   def add(a, b):\n       return a + b\n\n   class TestAddFunction(unittest.TestCase):\n       def test_add(self):\n           self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       unittest.main()\n   ```\n\n5. **Integrating third-party services**: Python can be used to integrate APIs and other services, using libraries like `requests`.\n\n   ```python\n   # Using requests to make an API call\n   import requests\n\n   response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')\n   if response.status_code == 200:\n       data = response.json()\n       # Process data\n   ```\n\nIn addition to Django and Flask, other libraries and tools that are commonly used in Python web development include:\n\n- **Pyramid**: A flexible web framework that can scale from simple to complex applications.\n- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.\n- **Tornado**: A scalable, non-blocking web server and web application framework.\n\nThese tools and libraries make Python a powerful language for web development, allowing developers to create robust and efficient web applications."
