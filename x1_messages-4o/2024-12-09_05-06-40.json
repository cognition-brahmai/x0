My current training loop is as follows:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(100):\n    batch_xs, batch_ys = mnist.train.next_batch(100)\n    sess.run(train_step, feed_dict={x: batch_xs, y_: batch_ys})\n```\nWhere `train_step` is defined as:\n```python\ntrain_step = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(0.01).minimize(cross_entropy)\n```\nAnd `cross_entropy` is the loss which I want to print out:\n```python\ncross_entropy = -tf.reduce_sum(y_ * tf.log(y))\n```\nAn attempt to print this would be to explicitly compute `cross_entropy` in the training loop:\n```python\nfor i in range(100):\n    batch_xs, batch_ys = mnist.train.next_batch(100)\n    cross_entropy = -tf.reduce_sum(y_ * tf.log(y))\n    print 'loss = ' + str(cross_entropy)\n    sess.run(train_step, feed_dict={x: batch_xs, y_: batch_ys})\n```\nHowever, given that `cross_entropy` is already computed during `sess.run(train_step, ...)`, it seems inefficient to compute it twice, requiring twice the number of forward passes of all the training data. Is there a way to access the value of `cross_entropy` when it was computed during `sess.run(train_step, ...)`? Also, how do I print a `tf.Variable`? Using `str(cross_entropy)` gives me an error."

        "content": "In TensorFlow, you can compute and print the value of a tensor, such as `cross_entropy`, during the training process by using the `sess.run()` function. You can do this by including the tensor you want to evaluate in the list of tensors passed to `sess.run()`. Here's how you can modify your training loop to print the training loss after every step without recomputing it:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(100):\n    batch_xs, batch_ys = mnist.train.next_batch(100)\n    # Run the training step and compute cross_entropy at the same time\n    _, loss_value = sess.run([train_step, cross_entropy], feed_dict={x: batch_xs, y_: batch_ys})\n    print(f'Step {i}, Loss: {loss_value}')\n```\n\nIn the above code, `sess.run()` is executed with a list `[train_step, cross_entropy]`, which means it will perform both the `train_step` operation and compute the value of `cross_entropy`. The output of `sess.run()` is a list of values corresponding to the operations and tensors you included in the list. The first element (`_`) corresponds to the `train_step` (we don't need to do anything with it, so it's assigned to `_`), and the second element (`loss_value`) is the computed value of `cross_entropy`, which you can then print.\n\nThis approach ensures you don't perform unnecessary computations, as TensorFlow will efficiently compute both operations in a single run through the graph."
