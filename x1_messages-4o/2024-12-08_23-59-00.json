The program should now require the input to include a start and end date range in addition to the task name, priority, and deadline, all stored in the form of a HashMap. The output should be a list of task groups, where each group represents a set of tasks that meet the threshold criteria, have a deadline within the specified range, and are categorized by deadline. Within each group, the tasks should be sorted in descending order of priority. As an example, suppose we have the following input:\n{ \"Task 1\": {priority: 2, deadline: \"2022-07-01\"}, \"Task 2\": {priority: 1, deadline: \"2022-07-02\"}, \"Task 3\": {priority: 3, deadline: \"2022-07-01\"}, \"Task 4\": {priority: 2, deadline: \"2022-07-03\"}, \"Task 5\": {priority: 4, deadline: \"2022-07-01\"} }\nwith threshold value of 2 and date range between \"2022-07-01\" to \"2022-07-03\"\nThe output should be:\n[ {deadline: \"2022-07-01\", tasks: [ \"Task 5\", \"Task 1\", \"Task 3\" ]}, {deadline: \"2022-07-03\", tasks: [ \"Task 4\" ]} ]"

        "content": "To achieve the desired functionality, we need to expand the existing Java program to include grouping tasks by their deadlines, filtering out tasks based on both priority and deadline range, and sorting tasks within each group in descending order of priority. Here's a step-by-step guide to implementing this in Java:\n\n1. **Create a Task Class**: Each task will have a name, priority, and deadline. This class will also implement the `Comparable` interface to allow sorting based on priority.\n\n2. **Parse Input**: Parse the input data to create Task objects and store them in a list.\n\n3. **Filter and Group Tasks**: Filter tasks based on the priority threshold and the date range. Group these tasks by their deadlines.\n\n4. **Sort and Output Tasks**: Sort the tasks within each group by descending priority and prepare the output.\n\nHere's the Java program that implements the above logic:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.*;\nimport java.text.*;\n\nclass Task implements Comparable<Task> {\n    String name;\n    int priority;\n    Date deadline;\n    \n    public Task(String name, int priority, Date deadline) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.priority = priority;\n        this.deadline = deadline;\n    }\n    \n    @Override\n    public int compareTo(Task other) {\n        return Integer.compare(other.priority, this.priority); // Sort in descending order of priority\n    }\n}\n\npublic class TaskOrganizer {\n    \n    public static void main(String[] args) throws ParseException {\n        // Input tasks\n        Map<String, Map<String, Object>> tasksMap = new HashMap<>();\n        tasksMap.put(\"Task 1\", Map.of(\"priority\", 2, \"deadline\", \"2022-07-01\"));\n        tasksMap.put(\"Task 2\", Map.of(\"priority\", 1, \"deadline\", \"2022-07-02\"));\n        tasksMap.put(\"Task 3\", Map.of(\"priority\", 3, \"deadline\", \"2022-07-01\"));\n        tasksMap.put(\"Task 4\", Map.of(\"priority\", 2, \"deadline\", \"2022-07-03\"));\n        tasksMap.put(\"Task 5\", Map.of(\"priority\", 4, \"deadline\", \"2022-07-01\"));\n\n        int threshold = 2;\n        String startDateStr = \"2022-07-01\";\n        String endDateStr = \"2022-07-03\";\n        \n        SimpleDateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat(\"yyyy-MM-dd\");\n        Date startDate = dateFormat.parse(startDateStr);\n        Date endDate = dateFormat.parse(endDateStr);\n\n        // Parse tasks into a list of Task objects\n        List<Task> tasks = new ArrayList<>();\n        for (Map.Entry<String, Map<String, Object>> entry : tasksMap.entrySet()) {\n            String name = entry.getKey();\n            int priority = (int) entry.getValue().get(\"priority\");\n            Date deadline = dateFormat.parse((String) entry.getValue().get(\"deadline\"));\n            tasks.add(new Task(name, priority, deadline));\n        }\n        \n        // Filter tasks based on priority and date range\n        Map<String, List<Task>> groupedTasks = new TreeMap<>();\n        for (Task task : tasks) {\n            if (task.priority > threshold && !task.deadline.before(startDate) && !task.deadline.after(endDate)) {\n                String deadlineStr = dateFormat.format(task.deadline);\n                groupedTasks.computeIfAbsent(deadlineStr, k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(task);\n            }\n        }\n        \n        // Sort tasks within each deadline group by descending priority\n        List<Map<String, Object>> result = new ArrayList<>();\n        for (Map.Entry<String, List<Task>> entry : groupedTasks.entrySet()) {\n            List<Task> taskList = entry.getValue();\n            Collections.sort(taskList);\n            \n            List<String> taskNames = new ArrayList<>();\n            for (Task task : taskList) {\n                taskNames.add(task.name);\n            }\n            \n            Map<String, Object> group = new HashMap<>();\n            group.put(\"deadline\", entry.getKey());\n            group.put(\"tasks\", taskNames);\n            result.add(group);\n        }\n        \n        // Print the result\n        System.out.println(result);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Task Class**: Represents a task with a name, priority, and deadline. Implements `Comparable` to sort tasks by priority.\n\n- **Parsing and Filtering**: The program parses the input data, creates Task objects, and filters them based on priority and date range.\n\n- **Grouping and Sorting**: Tasks are grouped by their deadline dates using a `TreeMap` to maintain sorted order. Within each group, tasks are sorted by descending priority.\n\n- **Output**: The final output is a list of maps, each containing a deadline and a sorted list of task names that meet the criteria."
