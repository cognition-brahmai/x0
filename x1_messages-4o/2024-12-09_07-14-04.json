Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\n# Example array\narray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# Get the total number of elements in the array\ntotal_elements = len(array)\n\nprint(f\"The total number of elements in the array is: {total_elements}\")\n```\n\nThis will give you the total count of all elements in the array. The `array.count(string)` method you used is indeed for counting the occurrences of a specific element within the array, not for counting all elements."
