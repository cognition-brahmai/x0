My Cython class is:\n\n```\ncdef class pyTest:\n     cdef Test* thisptr\n     cdef public vector[bool] test_fail\n     cdef public vector[double] test_ok\n\n     cdef __cinit__(self):\n         self.thisptr = new Test()\n         self.test_fail = self.thisptr.test_fail # compiles and works if commented\n         self.test_ok = self.thisptr.test_ok\n\n     cdef __dealloc__(self):\n         del self.thisptr\n```\nThe error I get is:\n\n```\nError compiling Cython file:\n------------------------------------------------------------\n...\n\n\n\n\ncdef extern from *:\n    ctypedef bool X 'bool'\n            ^\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nvector.from_py:37:13: 'bool' is not a type identifier\n```\nI'm using Python 2.7.6 and Cython 0.20.2 (also tried 0.20.1). I have `from libcpp cimport bool` at the top of my pyx file, as well as the vector import. Is this a bug? How can I circumvent this?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to how Cython handles `std::vector<bool>`. In C++, `std::vector<bool>` is a specialized template that optimizes the storage of boolean values, but this specialization can lead to complications when interfacing with Cython. Cython might not handle `std::vector<bool>` as expected, leading to the error you're seeing.\n\nHere's a workaround to address this issue:\n\n1. **Use `vector[int]` as a Replacement for `vector[bool]`:** Since `bool` is essentially an integer type (0 or 1), you can use `std::vector<int>` in both C++ and Cython. This approach avoids the complications associated with `std::vector<bool>`.\n\n2. **Modify the C++ Class:**\n   Change the type of `test_fail` from `std::vector<bool>` to `std::vector<int>`.\n\n   ```cpp\n   class Test\n   {\n     public:\n       std::vector<int> test_fail;  // Changed from bool to int\n       std::vector<double> test_ok;\n   };\n   ```\n\n3. **Update the Cython Definitions:**\n   Change the `vector[bool]` to `vector[int]` in your Cython class.\n\n   ```cython\n   cdef class pyTest:\n       cdef Test* thisptr\n       cdef public vector[int] test_fail  # Changed from bool to int\n       cdef public vector[double] test_ok\n\n       cdef __cinit__(self):\n           self.thisptr = new Test()\n           self.test_fail = self.thisptr.test_fail\n           self.test_ok = self.thisptr.test_ok\n\n       cdef __dealloc__(self):\n           del self.thisptr\n   ```\n\n4. **Handle Conversion in Python:**\n   When you access `test_fail` in Python, you can easily convert the integer values to boolean by using a simple list comprehension:\n\n   ```python\n   test_fail_bool = [bool(x) for x in py_test_instance.test_fail]\n   ```\n\nBy making these changes, you should be able to work around the limitations with `std::vector<bool>` in Cython. This approach maintains the logical structure of your code while using a more Cython-friendly type."
