Usually, I use the backslash to handle this as shown below:\n```python\nfrom module import function, another_function, \\\n            another_function\n```\nWhat is the purpose of the parentheses in this case and is it considered bad practice?"

        "content": "In Python, using parentheses for line continuation is a common and preferred practice compared to using the backslash (`\\`). The primary reason for this is readability and maintainability. Here's why using parentheses can be advantageous:\n\n1. **Readability**: Parentheses make it clear that the statement is being continued on the next line. This can make the code easier to read and understand, especially in complex import statements or any time you're dealing with long lines of code.\n\n2. **Error Reduction**: Using backslashes for line continuation can be error-prone. If there's any trailing whitespace after the backslash, it can lead to syntax errors that are sometimes hard to spot. Parentheses don't have this issue, as they naturally extend the statement until the closing parenthesis.\n\n3. **Consistency**: Parentheses are often used in other contexts for multi-line statements (like function calls or tuples), so using them for imports keeps the style consistent across your codebase.\n\n4. **PEP 8 Recommendation**: The Python Enhancement Proposal 8 (PEP 8), which is the style guide for Python code, recommends using parentheses for line continuation over backslashes.\n\nIn your example, using parentheses is not considered bad practice; in fact, it is generally preferred. The parentheses encapsulate the elements being imported, making it clear that they belong together and enhancing the overall readability of the code."
