In addition to the previous requirements, the puzzle now includes a code that needs to be analyzed to determine the missing keyword. Once you have all the keywords, put them in the correct order to form a sentence that answers the question about how AI is being utilized in healthcare. Here is the updated table and code:\n| AI Algorithm/Technology | Accuracy/Effectiveness | Integration into Healthcare Workflows |\n|-------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| ___-learning            | High                   | Used to predict patient outcomes       |\n| Natural ___ processing  | ___-level              | Used for patient communication         |\n| ___ recognition         | ___-level              | Used for medical image analysis        |\nCode: \nif (AI_algorithm == \"machine\") {\n  keyword1 = \"learning\";\n} else {\n  keyword1 = \"deep\";\n}\nif (AI_technology == \"speech\") {\n  keyword2 = \"natural language\";\n} else {\n  keyword2 = \"context\";\n}\nif (AI_analysis == \"image\") {\n  keyword3 = \"pattern\";\n} else {\n  keyword3 = \"object\";\n}\nCan you figure out the missing keywords and put them in the correct order to form a sentence that answers the question about AI utilization in healthcare?"
