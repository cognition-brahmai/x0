        "content": "When using Ansible, the behavior you are encountering is due to how Ansible handles variable precedence and merging. By default, Ansible does not merge dictionaries; instead, it replaces them entirely. However, you can achieve the desired behavior by using the `combine` filter to merge dictionaries selectively.\n\nHere's how you can override a single key in a dictionary without completely overwriting it:\n\n1. **Use the `combine` filter**: You can utilize the `combine` filter within your playbooks or tasks to merge dictionaries. This allows you to override specific keys while retaining the rest of the dictionary.\n\n2. **Example setup**:\n   - Assume you have a dictionary in `group_vars/all` like this:\n     ```yaml\n     my_dict:\n       key1: value1\n       key2: value2\n       key3: value3\n     ```\n   - And you have `host_vars/vagrantbox` where you want to override `key2`:\n     ```yaml\n     my_dict_override:\n       key2: new_value2\n     ```\n\n3. **In your playbook or task**:\n   Use the `combine` filter to merge these dictionaries:\n   ```yaml\n   ---\n   - hosts: vagrantbox\n     vars:\n       my_dict: \"{{ my_dict | combine(my_dict_override) }}\"\n     tasks:\n       - name: Print merged dictionary\n         debug:\n           var: my_dict\n   ```\n\nIn this setup, `my_dict` will have `key2` updated to `new_value2` while keeping `key1` and `key3` intact.\n\n4. **Ensure `hash_behaviour` is set to `merge`**:\n   You mentioned changing `hash_behaviour` to `merge`. While this setting can be used for merging dictionaries, it's crucial to ensure that it's correctly configured in your Ansible configuration file (`ansible.cfg`):\n\n   ```ini\n   [defaults]\n   hash_behaviour = merge\n   ```\n\n   However, note that this setting is not recommended for all scenarios as it can lead to unexpected behavior. It's better to use the `combine` filter method for specific merging needs.\n\nBy using the `combine` filter, you can selectively override keys in your dictionaries without affecting other keys, providing a more controlled and predictable configuration management process."
