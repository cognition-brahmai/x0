The DataFrame contains an 'id' column with float64 data type, but these are actually identification numbers and need to be treated as strings. How can I change the data type of this column to a string with a given format, specifically '%10.0f', and avoid getting a decimal point in the resulting strings?"

        "content": "To change the data type of the 'id' column to a string in a pandas DataFrame and format it according to a specific pattern like '%10.0f', you can use the `apply` method along with a lambda function. This will ensure that the identification numbers are formatted without a decimal point. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {'id': [123.0, 456.0, 789.0]}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Convert 'id' column to string with specified format\ndf['id'] = df['id'].apply(lambda x: f'{x:10.0f}'.strip())\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nIn this example, `f'{x:10.0f}'` is used to format the numbers as strings with no decimal points. The `.strip()` method is applied to remove any leading or trailing whitespace that might be added by the formatting.\n\nThis will convert the 'id' column into strings formatted as specified, with no decimal points."
