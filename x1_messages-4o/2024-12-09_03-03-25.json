I am trying to use the syntax similar to the one used for lists to give a type hint that bar has to be a list consisting of ints. However, the following syntax throws exceptions for NumPy ndarray:\n\n```python\ndef foo(bar: np.ndarray[np.bool]):\n   ...\n\n> np.ndarray[np.bool]) (...) TypeError: 'type' object is not subscriptable\n```\nIs it possible to give dtype-specific type hints for np.ndarray?"

        "content": "As of now, Python's type hinting system and NumPy do not natively support specifying the dtype of an `ndarray` directly in the type hints in the way you might specify the type of elements in a list. However, there are a few approaches you can take to achieve a similar effect:\n\n### Using `numpy.typing`\n\nStarting with NumPy 1.21, there is support for more specific type hints using `numpy.typing`. You can specify the array type using `numpy.typing.NDArray`. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport numpy.typing as npt\n\ndef foo(bar: npt.NDArray[np.bool_]) -> None:\n    ...\n```\n\nHere, `npt.NDArray[np.bool_]` indicates that `bar` should be a NumPy array with a boolean dtype.\n\n### Using `typing` module\n\nYou can also use the `typing` module along with some custom typing to achieve a similar effect:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Any\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef foo(bar: np.ndarray) -> None:\n    assert bar.dtype == np.bool_, \"Expected an ndarray with dtype of np.bool_\"\n    ...\n```\n\nIn this example, you use an assertion inside the function to ensure that the dtype is as expected. This does not give you compile-time type checking but does enforce the type at runtime.\n\n### Custom Type Alias\n\nFor more complex scenarios, you might consider defining a custom type alias:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport numpy.typing as npt\n\nBoolArray = npt.NDArray[np.bool_]\n\ndef foo(bar: BoolArray) -> None:\n    ...\n```\n\nThis creates a type alias `BoolArray` for a NumPy array with boolean dtype, improving the readability of your code.\n\nThese methods allow you to specify the type of NumPy arrays in a way that is consistent with Python's type hinting system, although true dtype-specific type checking still requires some runtime checks."
