However, I am encountering problems when handling the time offset at the end (-07:00). When I do not include the offset, I can successfully convert the timestamp like this:\n\n```python\ntime_str = \"2012-07-24T23:14:29\"\ntime_obj=datetime.datetime.strptime(time_str,'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S')\n```\n\nBut when I include the offset and try:\n\n```python\ntime_str = \"2012-07-24T23:14:29-07:00\"\ntime_obj=datetime.datetime.strptime(time_str,'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S-%z')\n```\n\nI get a ValueError saying that \"z\" is a bad directive. Can anyone suggest a workaround?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that the `%z` directive is not supported by the `strptime` method in Python's `datetime` module for parsing the timezone offset in certain environments. However, you can use the `dateutil` module, which is more flexible and can handle ISO 8601 date strings with time zones directly. Here's how you can do it:\n\nFirst, you need to install the `python-dateutil` library if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\npip install python-dateutil\n```\n\nThen, you can use it as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom dateutil import parser\n\ntime_str = \"2012-07-24T23:14:29-07:00\"\ntime_obj = parser.parse(time_str)\n\nprint(time_obj)\n```\n\nThe `parser.parse` function from the `dateutil` library will automatically handle the timezone offset for you, and you will get a `datetime` object with the timezone information correctly parsed. This approach is much more straightforward for dealing with ISO 8601 formatted strings."
