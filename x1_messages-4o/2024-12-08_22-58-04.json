        "content": "Certainly! To differentiate between peripheral input and output devices based on their main function, you can use a simple PHP script to categorize them. Input devices are used to provide data and control signals to a computer, while output devices receive data from the computer and present it to the user. Here's a basic PHP script that demonstrates this differentiation:\n\n```php\n<?php\n\nfunction categorizePeripheral($device) {\n    $inputDevices = ['keyboard', 'mouse', 'scanner', 'microphone', 'webcam'];\n    $outputDevices = ['monitor', 'printer', 'speakers', 'projector', 'headphones'];\n\n    if (in_array(strtolower($device), $inputDevices)) {\n        return \"Input Device\";\n    } elseif (in_array(strtolower($device), $outputDevices)) {\n        return \"Output Device\";\n    } else {\n        return \"Unknown Device\";\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\n$device1 = \"Keyboard\";\n$device2 = \"Monitor\";\n\necho \"$device1 is an \" . categorizePeripheral($device1) . \".\\n\";\necho \"$device2 is an \" . categorizePeripheral($device2) . \".\\n\";\n\n?>\n```\n\n### Examples of Peripheral Devices:\n- **Input Device Example:** \n  - **Keyboard:** Used to input text and commands into a computer.\n- **Output Device Example:** \n  - **Monitor:** Displays visual output from the computer to the user.\n\nThis script categorizes devices based on predefined lists of common input and output devices. You can expand these lists with more devices as needed."
