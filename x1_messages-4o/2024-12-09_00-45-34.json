I have used the example from the official wiki and modified the search space accordingly. When I run my code, I encounter a ValueError: 'negative arg to lognormal_cdf'. I also tried without applying the logarithmic transformation, but then the output values are in logarithmic transformation which is incorrect. How can I resolve this issue?\n\nHere is my code:\n\n```python\nimport pickle\nimport time\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom hyperopt import fmin, tpe, hp, STATUS_OK, Trials\n\ndef objective(x):\n    return {\n        'loss': x ** 2,\n        'status': STATUS_OK,\n        'eval_time': time.time(),\n        'other_stuff': {'type': None, 'value': [0, 1, 2]},\n        'attachments': {'time_module': pickle.dumps(time.time)}\n        }\ntrials = Trials()\nbest = fmin(objective,\n    space=hp.qloguniform('x', np.log(0.001), np.log(0.1), np.log(0.001)),\n    algo=tpe.suggest,\n    max_evals=100,\n    trials=trials)\npd.DataFrame(trials.trials)\n```\n\nError message:\n\n```python\nValueError: ('negative arg to lognormal_cdf', array([-3.45387764,\n  -3.45387764, -3.45387764, -3.45387764, -3.45387764,\n  -3.45387764, -3.45387764, -3.45387764, -3.45387764, -3.45387764,\n  -3.45387764, -3.45387764, -3.45387764, -3.45387764, -3.45387764,\n  -3.45387764, -3.45387764, -3.45387764, -3.45387764, -3.45387764,\n  -3.45387764, -3.45387764, -3.45387764, -3.45387764]))\n```\n\nAttempt without logarithmic transformation:\n\n```python\nhp.qloguniform('x', 0.001,0.1, 0.001)\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with the `qloguniform` function in Hyperopt is due to the way the function is trying to generate values. The `qloguniform` function generates values that are log-uniformly distributed. When you pass `np.log(0.001)` and `np.log(0.1)` into the `qloguniform`, it expects those values to be valid for a log-normal distribution, and the domain for this should be positive. However, the way you've specified the search space might be causing the negative values that lead to the error.\n\nHere are a few steps to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Correct Usage of `qloguniform`:**\n   The `qloguniform` function requires three parameters: `low`, `high`, and `q`. These should all be positive numbers as they are used in a log-uniform distribution context. The `q` parameter is the quantization level, meaning the step size of the quantized values.\n\n2. **Specification of Parameters:**\n   Ensure that the `low` and `high` parameters in `qloguniform` are specified such that they make sense in the context of a log-uniform distribution. The `q` parameter should be the minimum step size you want between values.\n\n3. **Adjust the Code:**\n   Modify your code so that the parameters to `qloguniform` are valid. Below is a revised version of your code:\n\n   ```python\n   import pickle\n   import time\n   import pandas as pd\n   import numpy as np\n   from hyperopt import fmin, tpe, hp, STATUS_OK, Trials\n\n   def objective(x):\n       return {\n           'loss': x ** 2,\n           'status': STATUS_OK,\n           'eval_time': time.time(),\n           'other_stuff': {'type': None, 'value': [0, 1, 2]},\n           'attachments': {'time_module': pickle.dumps(time.time)}\n       }\n\n   trials = Trials()\n\n   # Adjust the parameters here for qloguniform\n   best = fmin(\n       objective,\n       space=hp.qloguniform('x', np.log(0.001), np.log(0.1), 0.001),\n       algo=tpe.suggest,\n       max_evals=100,\n       trials=trials\n   )\n\n   # Show results\n   results_df = pd.DataFrame(trials.trials)\n   print(results_df)\n   ```\n\n4. **Explanation of Parameters:**\n   - Ensure that `np.log(0.001)` and `np.log(0.1)` are valid ranges for a log-uniform distribution. \n   - The `q` value should probably be a positive number like `0.001` to ensure proper quantization.\n\nIf you still encounter issues after making these adjustments, double-check the values being produced by the search space and ensure they align with your expectations for the model tuning process."
