        "content": "The formula you provided is a straightforward way to estimate the minimum number of adhesive bandages needed in a basic emergency first aid kit. Here's the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1. **Number of people in the group:** This represents the total number of individuals who will be using the first aid kit. In your example, this is 10 people.\n\n2. **Average number of cuts and scrapes per person per year:** This is an estimate of how frequently each person might need a bandage due to minor injuries. In your example, it's 5 cuts and scrapes per person per year.\n\n3. **Number of years the kit will be used:** This indicates the duration for which the kit is expected to serve the group. In your example, it's 2 years.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Minimum number of adhesive bandages needed} = (\\text{number of people in group}) \\times (\\text{average number of cuts and scrapes per person per year}) \\times (\\text{number of years kit will be used})\n\\]\n\nPlugging in your values:\n\\[\n10 \\times 5 \\times 2 = 100\n\\]\n\nSo, for a group of 10 people, with each person averaging 5 cuts and scrapes per year, and the kit intended to last for 2 years, you would need at least 100 adhesive bandages. This calculation helps ensure that the first aid kit is adequately stocked to cover minor injuries over the specified period."
