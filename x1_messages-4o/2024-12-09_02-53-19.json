For example, when I run the following code:\n\n```python\na = [1, 2, 3]\nb = [4, 5, 6].extend(a)\nprint(b)\n```\n\nI am expecting the output to be `[4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3]`. However, the output I'm getting is `None`. Why is Python returning `None` instead of extending the list?"

        "content": "The behavior you are observing is due to how the `extend` method works in Python. The `extend` method modifies the list in place and returns `None`. This means that when you call `extend` on a list, it adds the elements of the specified iterable to the end of the list, but it does not return the modified list itself.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what is happening in your code:\n\n```python\na = [1, 2, 3]\nb = [4, 5, 6].extend(a)\nprint(b)\n```\n\n1. `[4, 5, 6].extend(a)` modifies the list `[4, 5, 6]` by appending the elements of `a` to it. However, `extend` does not return the modified list; it returns `None`.\n\n2. Therefore, `b` is assigned the value `None`.\n\n3. When you print `b`, you get `None`.\n\nTo achieve the expected behavior, you should modify the list and then print it directly, like this:\n\n```python\na = [1, 2, 3]\nb = [4, 5, 6]\nb.extend(a)\nprint(b)\n```\n\nThis will correctly output:\n\n```\n[4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nIn this revised code, `b` is initially set to `[4, 5, 6]`, and then `extend` is called on `b` to add the elements of `a` to it. Finally, printing `b` gives you the extended list."
