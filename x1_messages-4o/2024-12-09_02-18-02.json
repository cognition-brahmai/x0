For instance, if my input is:\n\n```python\na = dict()\na['cat'] = 1\na['fish'] = 10\na['aardvark'] = 1000\n\nb = dict()\nb['cat'] = 2\nb['dog'] = 200\nb['aardvark'] = 2000\n```\nI would like the result to be:\n\n```python\n{'cat': 3, 'fish': 10, 'dog': 200, 'aardvark': 3000}\n```"

        "content": "To achieve this, you can iterate over the keys in both dictionaries and sum the values for each key. If a key exists in only one dictionary, you simply take its value. Here\u2019s a step-by-step way to do it in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the dictionaries\na = {\n    'cat': 1,\n    'fish': 10,\n    'aardvark': 1000\n}\n\nb = {\n    'cat': 2,\n    'dog': 200,\n    'aardvark': 2000\n}\n\n# Create a new dictionary to store the result\nresult = {}\n\n# Use a set to iterate over all unique keys from both dictionaries\nfor key in set(a) | set(b):\n    # Use the get method to handle missing keys and sum the values\n    result[key] = a.get(key, 0) + b.get(key, 0)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code snippet will give you the desired output:\n\n```python\n{'cat': 3, 'fish': 10, 'dog': 200, 'aardvark': 3000}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `set(a) | set(b)` creates a set of all unique keys from both dictionaries.\n- `dict.get(key, 0)` is used to retrieve the value for `key` from the dictionary, defaulting to `0` if the key is not present. This ensures that keys present in only one dictionary are still included in the result with their corresponding values."
