        "content": "The error you're encountering is because `numpy.ndarray` objects do not have a `count()` method. Instead, you can use the `numpy` library's functionality to count occurrences of specific elements within an array. Here's how you can count the number of 0s and 1s in your array:\n\nYou can use the `numpy` function `np.sum()` in combination with boolean indexing to count the occurrences of a specific value. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ny = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1])\n\n# Count the number of 0s\ncount_zeros = np.sum(y == 0)\n\n# Count the number of 1s\ncount_ones = np.sum(y == 1)\n\nprint(\"Number of 0s:\", count_zeros)\nprint(\"Number of 1s:\", count_ones)\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `np.bincount()` function, which is specifically useful for counting occurrences of small integer values:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ny = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1])\n\n# Use np.bincount to count occurrences of each integer\ncounts = np.bincount(y)\n\n# Number of 0s and 1s\ncount_zeros = counts[0]\ncount_ones = counts[1]\n\nprint(\"Number of 0s:\", count_zeros)\nprint(\"Number of 1s:\", count_ones)\n```\n\nBoth methods will give you the desired count of 0s and 1s in the array."
