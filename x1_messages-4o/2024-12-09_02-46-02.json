I am particularly interested in understanding how the overloads work and what the parameters mean. For instance, overload #1 with TrainingParameterScheduleDouble(value, minibatchSize) sets the learning rate to value per minibatchSize number of samples, but I am finding the term minibatchSize misleading. Also, I am not clear on the purpose of epochSize in overload #4 and what happens when the learning rate changes in the middle of a minibatch in overload #5."

        "content": "The `TrainingParameterScheduleDouble` class in the Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) C# API is used to define a schedule for parameters that can vary over time during the training process, such as the learning rate. This class allows you to specify how these parameters should change at different points in the training, which can be crucial for optimizing the training process.\n\nLet's break down the different overloads and parameters:\n\n1. **Overload #1**: `TrainingParameterScheduleDouble(double value, uint minibatchSize)`\n\n   - **value**: This is the fixed value of the training parameter (e.g., learning rate) that you want to use throughout the training process.\n   - **minibatchSize**: This parameter specifies the unit for scaling the training parameter. Although it might be confusing, this does not set the size of the minibatch. Instead, it indicates that the value is to be interpreted on a per-sample basis. Essentially, the schedule is stating that the learning rate is `value` per `minibatchSize` samples.\n\n2. **Overload #4**: `TrainingParameterScheduleDouble(IEnumerable<Pair<double, uint>> schedule, uint epochSize)`\n\n   - **schedule**: An enumerable collection of pairs where each pair consists of a `double` and a `uint`. The `double` represents the value of the parameter (e.g., learning rate), and the `uint` represents the number of units (in terms of samples or epochs) for which this value should be used.\n   - **epochSize**: This defines the number of samples that constitute one epoch. This is important because it dictates how the schedule should interpret the units in the `schedule` parameter. If you are specifying values based on epochs, the `epochSize` will help determine when to switch to the next value in the schedule.\n\n3. **Overload #5**: `TrainingParameterScheduleDouble(IEnumerable<double> schedule, uint epochSize, uint minibatchSize)`\n\n   - **schedule**: Similar to overload #4, but here it\u2019s a simple list of `double` values. Each value represents the learning rate to be used for each epoch or unit defined by `epochSize`.\n   - **epochSize**: As in overload #4, this defines the number of samples per epoch.\n   - **minibatchSize**: This is used to define the granularity at which the learning rate is applied. If the learning rate changes mid-minibatch, CNTK will typically apply the new rate at the start of the next minibatch. The minibatchSize parameter helps define the scale or unit for the learning rate schedule, ensuring that changes are applied at logical points in the training process.\n\nIn terms of what happens when the learning rate changes mid-minibatch, CNTK usually applies the learning rate change at the start of the next minibatch. This ensures consistency and prevents abrupt changes within the same set of samples being processed.\n\nOverall, the `TrainingParameterScheduleDouble` class provides flexibility in how you can manage learning rate changes over the course of training, allowing you to finely tune this aspect of your model's learning process."
