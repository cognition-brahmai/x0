It says \"Missing recommended library: libGLU.so\", \"Missing recommended library: libXi.so\", and \"Missing recommended library: libXmu.so\". I am not very familiar with Linux and tried to use `apt-get install libGLU.so` to rectify the issue but it did not work. How can I resolve this issue and install these libraries on my 32-bit Linux machine?"

        "content": "The error messages you're encountering indicate that certain libraries are missing, which are necessary for the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit to function properly. These libraries are part of the OpenGL Utility Toolkit and X Window System, which are commonly used for graphical applications.\n\nSince you mentioned you're on a 32-bit Linux machine, you will need to install the 32-bit versions of these libraries using the package manager. Here's how you can resolve the issue using `apt-get`:\n\n1. **Update the package list**:\n   Open a terminal and run the following command to make sure your package list is up to date:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   ```\n\n2. **Install the missing libraries**:\n   Now, install the required libraries using the following command:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa:i386 libxi6:i386 libxmu6:i386\n   ```\n\n   Here's a breakdown of what each package does:\n   - `libglu1-mesa:i386`: Provides the GLU (OpenGL Utility Library) for 32-bit systems.\n   - `libxi6:i386`: Provides the X Input Extension library for 32-bit systems.\n   - `libxmu6:i386`: Provides the X miscellaneous utilities library for 32-bit systems.\n\n3. **Verify installation**:\n   After the installation is complete, you can verify that these libraries have been installed by checking their presence in the system library directory, typically `/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/`.\n\n4. **Proceed with CUDA installation**:\n   With these libraries installed, you should be able to run the NVIDIA CUDA toolkit installer again without encountering the same missing library errors.\n\nIf you encounter any further issues or additional missing libraries, you can use a similar approach to install them. Just ensure that you are installing the 32-bit versions (i386) if you're on a 32-bit machine."
