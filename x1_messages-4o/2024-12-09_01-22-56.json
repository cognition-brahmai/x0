When clicked, I want this link to open the file with a local application, specifically a molecule viewer. So far, I haven't been able to find the correct syntax to make this work. Can you help?"

        "content": "Certainly! To link to a local file in a markdown cell in an IPython (or Jupyter) notebook, you can use the following markdown syntax:\n\n```markdown\n[Display Text](relative/path/to/your/file)\n```\n\nTo ensure that the file opens with a local application, you must specify the correct relative path from the notebook's directory to the file you want to link. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Determine the Relative Path**: Ensure the file is in the same directory as your notebook or a subdirectory. For example, if your file is named `molecule.xyz` and is in a folder called `files`, the relative path would be `files/molecule.xyz`.\n\n2. **Use the Markdown Link Syntax**: Insert the link into a markdown cell using the syntax mentioned above. For example:\n\n   ```markdown\n   [Open Molecule File](files/molecule.xyz)\n   ```\n\n3. **Ensure Correct Permissions**: Make sure the file permissions allow it to be opened by external applications. Sometimes, permissions might restrict access.\n\n4. **Launching with a Specific Application**: By default, clicking the link will attempt to download the file rather than open it with a specific application. If you want to open it directly with a molecule viewer, you might need to configure your operating system to open files of that type with your preferred application by default.\n\n5. **Open the Notebook in a Local Server**: Ensure that your Jupyter Notebook is running on your local machine, as local file links will not work when accessed through a remote Jupyter server.\n\nHere's an example markdown cell content:\n\n```markdown\n### Open Molecule File\n[Open Molecule File](files/molecule.xyz)\n```\n\nAfter adding the markdown, click the link, and it should prompt your browser to download the file. If you've set your file type associations correctly, it will open with the designated application."
