        "content": "To calculate the accuracy of a machine learning model that predicts sentiment, you use the following formula:\n\n### Accuracy\n\\[ \\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{\\text{Number of correct predictions}}{\\text{Total number of predictions}} \\]\n\n### Classification Algorithms and Their Methodologies\n\n1. **Logistic Regression**:\n   - **Formula**: Logistic regression predicts the probability that a given input point belongs to a certain class. It uses the logistic function:\n     \\[ P(Y=1|X) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + \\ldots + \\beta_nX_n)}} \\]\n   - **Methodology**: The algorithm estimates the parameters \\(\\beta\\) using maximum likelihood estimation. It is best suited for binary classification problems.\n\n2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**:\n   - **Formula**: SVM aims to find the hyperplane that best separates the classes. The decision function is:\n     \\[ f(x) = \\text{sign}(w \\cdot x + b) \\]\n   - **Methodology**: SVM constructs a hyperplane in a high-dimensional space, with the goal of maximizing the margin between data points of different classes. It uses kernel functions to handle non-linearly separable data.\n\n3. **Decision Tree**:\n   - **Formula**: Decision trees use tree-like models of decisions. The algorithm splits the data based on feature values.\n   - **Methodology**: The tree is built by recursively splitting the data into subsets. Each node represents a decision based on a feature, and branches represent the outcome of that decision. The splitting criteria can be Gini impurity or information gain.\n\n4. **Naive Bayes**:\n   - **Formula**: Naive Bayes applies Bayes' theorem with the assumption of conditional independence between features.\n     \\[ P(C|X) = \\frac{P(X|C) \\cdot P(C)}{P(X)} \\]\n   - **Methodology**: It calculates the probability of each class given the input features and selects the class with the highest probability. It\u2019s suitable for text classification due to its simplicity and efficiency.\n\n### Evaluation Metrics\n\n- **Precision**:\n  \\[ \\text{Precision} = \\frac{\\text{True Positives}}{\\text{True Positives} + \\text{False Positives}} \\]\n\n- **Recall** (Sensitivity):\n  \\[ \\text{Recall} = \\frac{\\text{True Positives}}{\\text{True Positives} + \\text{False Negatives}} \\]\n\n- **F1 Score**:\n  \\[ \\text{F1 Score} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\text{Precision} \\cdot \\text{Recall}}{\\text{Precision} + \\text{Recall}} \\]\n\n### Impact of Feature Extraction Techniques\n\n1. **Bag-of-Words (BoW)**:\n   - Represents text as a set of word occurrences, ignoring grammar and word order.\n   - **Impact**: Simple and effective for smaller datasets but can lead to high dimensionality and sparsity.\n\n2. **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**:\n   - Weighs the frequency of a word in a document relative to its frequency across all documents.\n   - **Impact**: Reduces the impact of common words and enhances the significance of rare words, improving model accuracy.\n\n3. **Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe)**:\n   - Captures semantic meaning by representing words in dense vector space.\n   - **Impact**: Enhances model performance by capturing semantic relationships and context, especially beneficial for deep learning models.\n\n### Recommendations for Optimizing Model Performance\n\n- **Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize text data by removing stop words, punctuation, and performing stemming or lemmatization.\n- **Feature Engineering**: Experiment with different feature extraction techniques; for instance, combining TF-IDF with word embeddings can yield better performance.\n- **Model Selection**: Use cross-validation to select the best algorithm and hyperparameters. Consider ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting for better accuracy.\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use techniques like grid search or random search to find optimal model parameters.\n- **Data Augmentation**: Increase the diversity of your dataset to improve model generalization, especially important for small datasets.\n\nBy applying these strategies, you can enhance the predictive accuracy and robustness of your sentiment analysis model."
