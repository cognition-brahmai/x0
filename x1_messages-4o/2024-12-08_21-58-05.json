        "content": "To swap the positions of two words in a string using Ruby, you can use the `gsub` method along with capturing groups in a regular expression. Here's a simple way to achieve this:\n\n```ruby\ndef swap_words(str, word1, word2)\n  str.gsub(/(#{word1})(.*)(#{word2})/) do\n    \"#{word2}#{$2}#{word1}\"\n  end\nend\n\noriginal_string = \"The quick brown fox\"\nswapped_string = swap_words(original_string, \"quick\", \"brown\")\nputs swapped_string\n```\n\nThis code defines a method `swap_words` which takes a string and two words as arguments. It uses a regular expression to find the two words and the text between them. The `gsub` method replaces the matched pattern with the second word, the text between the two words, and then the first word, effectively swapping them.\n\nWhen you run the code with the string \"The quick brown fox\" and specify \"quick\" and \"brown\" as the words to swap, it will output \"The brown quick fox\"."
