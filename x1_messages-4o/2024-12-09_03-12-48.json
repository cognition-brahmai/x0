I have a CSV file that looks like this:\n\n```\nYear:  Dec: Jan:\n1      50   60\n2      25   50\n3      30   30\n4      40   20\n5      10   10\n```\n\nI know how to read the file in and print each column (for example, ['Year', '1', '2', '3', etc]). But I want to read the rows so that they would look like this: ['Year', 'Dec', 'Jan'] and then ['1', '50', '60'], etc. I would also like to store those numbers ['1', '50', '60'] into variables so that I can total them later. For example, `Year_1 = ['50', '60']`, then I could do `sum(Year_1) = 110`. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To read rows from a CSV file and manipulate the data as you've described, you can use Python's built-in `csv` module, which provides functionality to read and write CSV files. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Read the CSV File:** Use the `csv.reader` to read the file.\n2. **Store Rows in Variables:** Store each row in a list or dictionary for further manipulation.\n3. **Convert Strings to Integers:** Convert the string values to integers so you can perform arithmetic operations like summation.\n\nHere's a sample code that demonstrates how to read rows from your CSV file and store them in a way that allows you to perform arithmetic operations:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\n# Open the CSV file\nwith open('data.csv', newline='') as csvfile:\n    csvreader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=' ', skipinitialspace=True)\n    \n    # Read the header\n    headers = next(csvreader)\n    print(\"Headers:\", headers)\n    \n    # Initialize a dictionary to store each year's data\n    data_by_year = {}\n\n    # Read each row in the csv\n    for row in csvreader:\n        # Split row into columns based on the space delimiter\n        columns = row[0].split()\n        \n        # Extract data\n        year = columns[0]\n        dec_value = int(columns[1])\n        jan_value = int(columns[2])\n        \n        # Store values in a dictionary\n        data_by_year[year] = [dec_value, jan_value]\n        \n        # Print the values for clarity\n        print(f\"Year {year}: Dec = {dec_value}, Jan = {jan_value}\")\n        \n# Example of accessing data and calculating sum for Year 1\nyear_1_data = data_by_year['1']\ntotal_year_1 = sum(year_1_data)\nprint(f\"Sum for Year 1: {total_year_1}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **CSV Reading:** The `csv.reader` is used to read the data. The `delimiter=' '` and `skipinitialspace=True` arguments help in correctly splitting the data when spaces are used as delimiters.\n2. **Headers:** The first row is read separately as headers.\n3. **Data Storage:** Each row's data is stored in a dictionary `data_by_year` where the key is the year and the value is a list of integers representing the December and January figures.\n4. **Summation:** You can easily access and sum the data for any specific year using the `sum()` function.\n\nThis code assumes your CSV data is stored in a file named `data.csv`. You might need to adjust the file path accordingly. Additionally, ensure that the file does not have any leading or trailing spaces in its data to avoid splitting issues."
