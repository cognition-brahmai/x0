The retrieved data must be formatted as a table with country names in one column and their corresponding capital cities in the other column for easier data manipulation and analysis."

        "content": "To accomplish this task using R, you'll need the `DBI` and `RSQLite` packages (or another suitable database interface if you're not using SQLite) to interact with your SQL database. The SQL query will filter, sort, and select the specified columns from the \"countries\" table. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to modify your R code to perform the desired operations:\n\n1. **Install and load necessary packages** (if not already installed):\n\n   ```r\n   install.packages(\"DBI\")\n   install.packages(\"RSQLite\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Connect to the database**: Establish a connection to your SQL database.\n\n   ```r\n   library(DBI)\n   library(RSQLite)\n\n   # Replace 'your_database_path' with the path to your SQLite database file\n   con <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = \"your_database_path\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Write and execute the SQL query**: Create a query that filters, sorts, and selects the required columns.\n\n   ```r\n   query <- \"\n     SELECT name AS country_name, capital AS capital_city\n     FROM countries\n     WHERE population >= 10000000\n     ORDER BY official_language ASC\n   \"\n\n   result <- dbGetQuery(con, query)\n   ```\n\n   - **Filtering**: The `WHERE` clause filters out countries with a population of less than 10 million.\n   - **Sorting**: The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the countries alphabetically by their official language.\n   - **Selecting Columns**: You select the `name` and `capital` columns, renaming them to `country_name` and `capital_city` for clarity.\n\n4. **Display the results**: Format the retrieved data as a table.\n\n   ```r\n   print(result)\n   ```\n\n5. **Close the connection**: Always ensure to close the database connection after your operations are complete.\n\n   ```r\n   dbDisconnect(con)\n   ```\n\nThis R code will retrieve the required data from your \"world\" database's \"countries\" table, filter and sort it as specified, and format it as a table with the names of countries and their corresponding capital cities. Make sure to replace `\"your_database_path\"` with the actual path to your SQLite database file if you're using a different type of database, you might need to adjust the connection setup accordingly."
