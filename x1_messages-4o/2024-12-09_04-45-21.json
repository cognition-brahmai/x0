        "content": "I am using Python's fcntl to lock a file on a Debian-based OS (Ubuntu, Debian Squeeze) with Python versions 2.7 and 3.2. Based on my understanding, fnctl.flock should lock a file such that an exception will be thrown if another client attempts to lock the same file. However, when I run my code, which first locks the file and then immediately tries to lock it again, no exception is thrown. Instead, it just prints \"No error\". The code is as follows:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\nimport fcntl\nfcntl.flock(open('/tmp/locktest', 'r'), fcntl.LOCK_EX)\ntry:\n    fcntl.flock(open('/tmp/locktest', 'r'), fcntl.LOCK_EX | fcntl.LOCK_NB)\nexcept IOError:\n    print(\"can't immediately write-lock the file ($!), blocking ...\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No error\")\n```\n\nEven when I split the code into two clients running simultaneously (one locking and then waiting, the other trying to lock after the first lock is already active), I get the same behavior - no effect at all. Furthermore, I have made changes as suggested by nightcracker and the updated version also prints \"No error\". Here's the updated code:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\nimport fcntl\nimport time\nfcntl.flock(open('/tmp/locktest', 'w'), fcntl.LOCK_EX | fcntl.LOCK_NB)\ntry:\n    fcntl.flock(open('/tmp/locktest', 'w'), fcntl.LOCK_EX | fcntl.LOCK_NB)\nexcept IOError:\n    print(\"can't immediately write-lock the file ($!), blocking ...\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No error\")\n```\n\nWhat could be the explanation for this behavior?"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is due to the way you're opening the file and handling the file descriptors. Each call to `open('/tmp/locktest', 'r')` or `open('/tmp/locktest', 'w')` results in a new file descriptor. Since `fcntl.flock` operates on file descriptors, each call to `open` essentially gives you a separate file descriptor, and the locks aren't shared between them. Therefore, the second `fcntl.flock` call is acting on a different file descriptor than the first one, and it does not detect the lock that was placed by the first call.\n\nTo properly test file locking, you need to maintain a single file descriptor and perform the lock operations on it. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired behavior:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\nimport fcntl\nimport os\n\n# Open the file once and reuse the file descriptor\nwith open('/tmp/locktest', 'w') as file:\n    # Lock the file\n    fcntl.flock(file, fcntl.LOCK_EX | fcntl.LOCK_NB)\n    try:\n        # Attempt to lock the file again with the same file descriptor\n        fcntl.flock(file, fcntl.LOCK_EX | fcntl.LOCK_NB)\n    except IOError:\n        print(\"can't immediately write-lock the file, blocking ...\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No error\")\n```\n\nIn this version, the `open` call is made once, and the same file descriptor (`file`) is used for both lock attempts. This should result in an `IOError` on the second `flock` call, as it attempts to lock a file that's already locked by the same process.\n\nIf you want to test file locking across different processes, you'll need to run separate scripts or use multiprocessing to ensure that different processes are attempting to lock the same file."
