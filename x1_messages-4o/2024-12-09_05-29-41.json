Here is my code for the profile and the error I am encountering:\n\nCode:\n```python\nclass RoadmapProfile(models.Model):\n    user = models.OneToOneField(\"auth.User\")\n    fullname = models.CharField(max_length=100, verbose_name=\"Full name\")\n```\nMigrations output:\n```shell\n  Migrations for 'profiles':\n      0001_initial.py:\n        - Create model RoadmapProfile\n```\nOutput when running \"migrate profiles\":\n```shell\nOperations to perform:\n  Apply all migrations: profiles\nRunning migrations:\n  No migrations to apply.\n```\nError when trying to open any page related to mezzanine.accounts:\n```shell\nOperationalError at /accounts/update/\n\nno such column: profiles_roadmapprofile.fullname\n```\nWhat could be the mistake I have made in this process?"

        "content": "Based on the information provided, it seems like there might be a few potential issues causing the problem with migrations and the database schema. Here's how you can troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify Migration Status:**\n   - Ensure that the migration files are indeed created for the `profiles` app. Check the `migrations` folder within the `profiles` app and verify that the `0001_initial.py` file exists with the correct migration operations.\n   - Check if the migration has been applied correctly by running:\n     ```shell\n     python manage.py showmigrations profiles\n     ```\n     This command will show you which migrations have been applied. Ensure that the migration for creating `RoadmapProfile` is marked as applied.\n\n2. **Check Database Schema:**\n   - It's possible that the migration was applied but the database schema wasn't updated correctly. You can manually inspect the database to check if the `fullname` column exists in the `profiles_roadmapprofile` table.\n\n3. **Reset Migrations and Reapply:**\n   - If the migration is marked as applied but the changes are not reflected in the database, you can reset the migrations for the `profiles` app. This involves:\n     - Deleting the existing migration files in the `profiles/migrations` directory (except for `__init__.py`).\n     - Running `python manage.py makemigrations profiles` to recreate the migration files.\n     - Running `python manage.py migrate profiles` to apply the new migrations.\n\n4. **Check for Migration Conflicts:**\n   - Ensure there are no conflicting migrations or dependencies in other apps that might affect the `profiles` app. The `mezzanine.accounts` app might have dependencies or overrides that conflict with your custom profile.\n\n5. **Database Integrity:**\n   - If you're working in a local development environment and data loss is not a concern, you can try resetting the entire database:\n     ```shell\n     python manage.py flush\n     python manage.py migrate\n     ```\n     This will clear the database and apply all migrations from scratch. Make sure to back up any important data before doing this.\n\n6. **Check for Customizations in `mezzanine.accounts`:**\n   - If you have customized any parts of `mezzanine.accounts`, ensure that these customizations are not interfering with the profiles app migration.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with the missing column and ensure that your migrations are applied correctly. If the problem persists, consider checking for any specific errors or logs that might give further insight into the issue."
