When I print the result of 'x/y', it displays as '1.00000e-05' in scientific notation. I want to suppress this scientific notation and make it display the result as '0.00001'. I will be using this result as a string. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To suppress the scientific notation in Python and display the result as a regular decimal string, you can format the floating-point number using Python's string formatting methods. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Using f-strings (Python 3.6 and above):**\n\n   ```python\n   x = 1.0\n   y = 100000.0\n   result = x / y\n   formatted_result = f\"{result:.5f}\"\n   print(formatted_result)  # Output: 0.00001\n   ```\n\n2. **Using `format()` function:**\n\n   ```python\n   x = 1.0\n   y = 100000.0\n   result = x / y\n   formatted_result = format(result, \".5f\")\n   print(formatted_result)  # Output: 0.00001\n   ```\n\n3. **Using `str.format()` method:**\n\n   ```python\n   x = 1.0\n   y = 100000.0\n   result = x / y\n   formatted_result = \"{:.5f}\".format(result)\n   print(formatted_result)  # Output: 0.00001\n   ```\n\nEach of these methods formats the floating-point result to 5 decimal places, thereby suppressing the scientific notation and displaying the number as a regular decimal string. Choose the method that best suits your coding style or version of Python you're using."
