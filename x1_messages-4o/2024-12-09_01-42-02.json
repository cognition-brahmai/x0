However, in Google Chrome version 57.0.2987.133, I get a console error: \"localhost/:1 XMLHttpRequest cannot load {my endpoint url}. Redirect from {my endpoint url} to {my endpoint url with a } has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin {requesting url} is therefore not allowed access.\" How can I solve this issue? The application works fine in Firefox version 52.0.2."

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies, which are stricter in certain browsers like Google Chrome. Here are some steps you can take to resolve the problem:\n\n1. **Ensure Correct Middleware Order:**\n   Make sure that `CorsMiddleware` is placed at the top of the middleware list in your `settings.py` file. This ensures it runs before any other middleware that could potentially short-circuit the request handling.\n\n   ```python\n   MIDDLEWARE = [\n       'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware',\n       # other middleware...\n   ]\n   ```\n\n2. **Double-check CORS Configuration:**\n   If you want to allow all origins, ensure that you have set the following in your `settings.py`:\n\n   ```python\n   CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL = True\n   ```\n\n   If you're using the whitelist approach, make sure you have included the correct domain:\n\n   ```python\n   CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST = (\n       'http://localhost:8000',\n       'http://127.0.0.1:8000',\n       # other domains if needed...\n   )\n   ```\n\n3. **Update Django and Python:**\n   Since you're using older versions of Django and Python, consider updating them if possible. Python 2.7 and Django 1.11a1 are outdated and no longer supported, which could lead to security issues and compatibility problems. If upgrading is not an immediate option, ensure your current setup is compatible with the `django-cors-headers` version you are using.\n\n4. **Check for Redirects:**\n   The error message mentions a redirect, which might be causing the CORS issue. Make sure that your endpoint URL is not performing any redirects. Test the endpoint URL directly in the browser to see if it redirects.\n\n5. **Server Configuration:**\n   Confirm that your Django server is correctly configured to handle CORS. Sometimes server settings outside of Django, such as a reverse proxy or web server settings, can affect CORS headers.\n\n6. **Use a Proxy:**\n   As a temporary workaround during development, you could use a proxy to bypass CORS issues. Configure your AngularJS application to send requests through a proxy server that does not enforce CORS restrictions.\n\n7. **Browser Extensions:**\n   While not a permanent solution, you can use a browser extension like \"Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *\" in Chrome to test if the issue is CORS-related. This should not be used in production.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the CORS issue you're experiencing in Google Chrome."
