If each sushi roll costs a whole dollar amount and the most expensive roll was twice as expensive as the cheapest roll, what was the cost of the second most expensive sushi roll?"

        "content": "Let's denote the cost of the six sushi rolls as \\( a, b, c, d, e, f \\) in ascending order, where \\( a \\) is the cheapest and \\( f \\) is the most expensive roll. According to the problem, the total cost is $57, and the most expensive roll is twice the cost of the cheapest roll. Thus, we can write:\n\n\\[ a + b + c + d + e + f = 57 \\]\n\\[ f = 2a \\]\n\nTo find the possible values, let's express \\( f \\) in terms of \\( a \\):\n\n\\[ a + b + c + d + e + 2a = 57 \\]\n\\[ 3a + b + c + d + e = 57 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find integer values for \\( a, b, c, d, e, \\) and \\( f \\) that satisfy these equations. As \\( f = 2a \\), let's consider possible integer values for \\( a \\) such that \\( 3a \\) is not too large (so there's room for the other terms to add up to 57).\n\n1. **If \\( a = 5 \\), then \\( f = 10 \\):**\n\n   Plug this into the equation:\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 5 + b + c + d + e = 57\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   15 + b + c + d + e = 57\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   b + c + d + e = 42\n   \\]\n\n   Now, assign the values such that \\( b, c, d, e \\) are distinct and in increasing order:\n\n   - Let \\( b = 6 \\)\n   - Let \\( c = 8 \\)\n   - Let \\( d = 12 \\)\n   - Let \\( e = 16 \\)\n\n   Check the sum:\n   \\[\n   6 + 8 + 12 + 16 = 42\n   \\]\n\n   This satisfies the condition. Therefore, the sequence is \\( 5, 6, 8, 12, 16, 10 \\).\n\nIn this sequence, the most expensive roll is $10, and the second most expensive roll is $16. Therefore, the cost of the second most expensive sushi roll is \\(\\boxed{16}\\)."
