        "content": "The issue you're facing is due to integer division in Python 2.x, where `1/3` results in `0` because both `1` and `3` are integers. To fix this and get the desired percentage output, you can make one of the numbers a float to ensure floating-point division. Additionally, you can format the output to display as a percentage. Here\u2019s how you can modify your code:\n\nFor Python 2.x:\n\n```python\nprint str(int((1.0/3) * 100)) + '%'\n```\n\nFor Python 3.x, where `print` is a function, you can also use string interpolation for better readability:\n\n```python\nprint(f\"{int((1/3) * 100)}%\")\n```\n\nOr using the `format` method:\n\n```python\nprint(\"{}%\".format(int((1/3) * 100)))\n```\n\nThese changes will result in the output `'33%'`, as expected."
