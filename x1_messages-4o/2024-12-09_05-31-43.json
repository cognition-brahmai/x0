Additionally, how can I validate this phone number? I am currently using a CharField to store the phone number as follows: \n\n```python\nphone_number = models.CharField(max_length=12)\n```"

        "content": "To optimally store and validate phone numbers in a Django application intended for global use, including country codes, you should consider using a library specifically designed for handling international phone numbers. One popular choice is the `django-phonenumber-field` library, which is built on top of the `phonenumbers` library, a Python port of Google's `libphonenumber`.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can set up and use `django-phonenumber-field`:\n\n### Step 1: Install the Required Packages\n\nFirst, install the necessary packages using pip:\n\n```sh\npip install django-phonenumber-field phonenumbers\n```\n\n### Step 2: Update Your Django Model\n\nModify your model to use the `PhoneNumberField` provided by `django-phonenumber-field`. Here\u2019s an example of how to adjust your existing model:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom phonenumber_field.modelfields import PhoneNumberField\n\nclass YourModelName(models.Model):\n    phone_number = PhoneNumberField()\n```\n\n### Step 3: Migrate Your Database\n\nAfter updating your model, you need to create and apply a migration to update your database schema:\n\n```sh\npython manage.py makemigrations\npython manage.py migrate\n```\n\n### Step 4: Validate the Phone Number\n\nThe `PhoneNumberField` will automatically handle validation of phone numbers, including checking for the correct format and presence of a valid country code. However, if you need additional custom validation, you can extend the functionality in your forms or serializers.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how you might validate a phone number in a Django form:\n\n```python\nfrom django import forms\nfrom .models import YourModelName\n\nclass YourModelForm(forms.ModelForm):\n    class Meta:\n        model = YourModelName\n        fields = ['phone_number']\n\n    def clean_phone_number(self):\n        phone_number = self.cleaned_data.get('phone_number')\n        # Additional custom validation logic can be added here if needed\n        return phone_number\n```\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n1. **Internationalization**: Make sure your application is set up to handle internationalization properly, as phone numbers from different countries can have different formats.\n   \n2. **User Interface**: Consider using a library like `intl-tel-input` on the frontend to enhance the user experience by providing a dropdown for country selection and formatting assistance.\n\nBy using `django-phonenumber-field`, you ensure that your application can handle a wide range of international phone number formats and provides built-in validation to ensure data integrity."
