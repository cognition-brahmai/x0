The list must include all eight planets and their respective attributes in a non-traditional order. The user should be able to identify the first planet on the list based on a unique attribute or characteristic that is not immediately obvious. Here is a sample Scala code for generating the planet list:\nval planets = List(\n  (\"Neptune\", \"8th planet from the sun\", \"14 moons\", \"4.5 billion km from the sun\"),\n  (\"Mars\", \"4th planet from the sun\", \"2 moons\", \"228 million km from the sun\"),\n  (\"Jupiter\", \"5th planet from the sun\", \"79 moons\", \"778 million km from the sun\"),\n  (\"Saturn\", \"6th planet from the sun\", \"82 moons\", \"1.4 billion km from the sun\"),\n  (\"Venus\", \"2nd planet from the sun\", \"0 moons\", \"108 million km from the sun\"),\n  (\"Uranus\", \"7th planet from the sun\", \"27 moons\", \"2.9 billion km from the sun\"),\n  (\"Mercury\", \"1st planet from the sun\", \"0 moons\", \"77 million km from the sun\"),\n  (\"Earth\", \"3rd planet from the sun\", \"1 moon\", \"150 million km from the sun\")\n)\nHow can I modify this code to add a puzzle element to the HTML page?"

        "content": "To create an HTML page in Scala that displays a list of celestial bodies with a puzzle element, we can use a web framework like Scala.js or Play Framework to render HTML. Since you want to introduce a puzzle element, we'll include a unique characteristic for users to identify the first planet on the list.\n\nLet's assume we're using a simple setup with Scala.js to generate the HTML. We'll add a puzzle by using an attribute that is not immediately obvious, like the number of moons, distance from the sun, or another fun fact. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n### Step 1: Prepare the Data\n\nFirst, you'll need to shuffle the list of planets and select a unique attribute to identify the first planet. Let's choose `distance from the sun` as the puzzle attribute.\n\n### Step 2: Generate HTML with Scala.js\n\nHere's a simplified Scala.js code to generate the HTML page:\n\n```scala\nimport scala.scalajs.js\nimport org.scalajs.dom\nimport org.scalajs.dom.document\nimport scala.util.Random\n\nobject PlanetPuzzleApp {\n  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\n    // Shuffle the planets list for a non-traditional order\n    val planets = List(\n      (\"Neptune\", \"8th planet from the sun\", \"14 moons\", \"4.5 billion km from the sun\"),\n      (\"Mars\", \"4th planet from the sun\", \"2 moons\", \"228 million km from the sun\"),\n      (\"Jupiter\", \"5th planet from the sun\", \"79 moons\", \"778 million km from the sun\"),\n      (\"Saturn\", \"6th planet from the sun\", \"82 moons\", \"1.4 billion km from the sun\"),\n      (\"Venus\", \"2nd planet from the sun\", \"0 moons\", \"108 million km from the sun\"),\n      (\"Uranus\", \"7th planet from the sun\", \"27 moons\", \"2.9 billion km from the sun\"),\n      (\"Mercury\", \"1st planet from the sun\", \"0 moons\", \"77 million km from the sun\"),\n      (\"Earth\", \"3rd planet from the sun\", \"1 moon\", \"150 million km from the sun\")\n    )\n\n    val shuffledPlanets = Random.shuffle(planets)\n\n    // Select the planet with the smallest distance from the sun as the first\n    val firstPlanet = shuffledPlanets.minBy(_._4.split(\" \")(0).toDouble)\n\n    // Create HTML content\n    val content = new StringBuilder\n    content.append(\"<h1>Celestial Bodies Puzzle</h1>\")\n    content.append(\"<p>Identify the first planet using its unique attribute: Closest distance to the sun.</p>\")\n    content.append(\"<ul>\")\n    shuffledPlanets.foreach { case (name, position, moons, distance) =>\n      content.append(s\"<li>$name - $position, $moons, $distance</li>\")\n    }\n    content.append(\"</ul>\")\n\n    // Append content to the body of the HTML\n    document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", { (e: dom.Event) =>\n      val body = document.body\n      body.innerHTML = content.toString()\n    })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Explanation\n\n1. **Shuffling Planets**: The list of planets is shuffled to create a non-traditional order.\n2. **Puzzle Element**: The puzzle is to identify the first planet based on its unique attribute, which is the smallest `distance from the sun`.\n3. **HTML Generation**: The HTML content is dynamically generated and injected into the DOM after the document is fully loaded.\n\n### Step 4: Running the Code\n\nTo run this Scala.js code, you'll need to set up a Scala.js project and compile it to JavaScript. The compiled JavaScript can then be included in an HTML page to display the puzzle.\n\nThis approach allows you to create a dynamic and interactive HTML page with a puzzle element using Scala."
