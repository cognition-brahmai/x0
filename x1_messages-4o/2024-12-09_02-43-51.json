I don't want to use the \"issubclass\" method or wrap each call in a try/except block as they both seem cumbersome. I'd prefer to use the object in good faith, but this may raise some AttributeErrors. Should I skip the error handling and only use objects with the required methods? If I do something like `[x**2 for x in 1234]`, I get a TypeError and not an AttributeError, so where is this type checking implemented? I'd like my library to be as helpful as possible and provide more information about how to solve the errors, similar to TypeErrors raised by native functions. Any best practices or clean ways to handle this?"

        "content": "When dealing with \"duck typing\" in Python, the idea is to rely on the presence of methods and attributes rather than on the type of an object. While Python doesn't enforce type checking, you can still make your code robust and informative without resorting to cumbersome techniques like `issubclass` or excessive try/except blocks. Here are some best practices and strategies you can use:\n\n1. **Use Function Annotations and Type Hints**: Although not enforced at runtime, type hints can greatly improve the readability and maintainability of your code. Tools like `mypy` can be used during development to perform static type checks.\n\n   ```python\n   def process_items(items: list) -> None:\n       for item in items:\n           # Assume item has a method `process`\n           item.process()\n   ```\n\n2. **Leverage `collections.abc` for Abstract Base Classes**: Instead of checking for specific types, you can check if an object conforms to a certain interface by using abstract base classes. This is more about ensuring that the object can behave like a certain type.\n\n   ```python\n   from collections.abc import Iterable\n\n   def process_items(items):\n       if not isinstance(items, Iterable):\n           raise TypeError(\"Expected an iterable\")\n       for item in items:\n           item.process()\n   ```\n\n3. **Graceful Degradation**: If certain methods are optional, you can use the `getattr` function to check for their presence and provide a default behavior if they are missing.\n\n   ```python\n   def process_item(item):\n       process_method = getattr(item, 'process', None)\n       if callable(process_method):\n           process_method()\n       else:\n           # Handle the absence of the method\n           print(f\"Item {item} cannot be processed.\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Custom Error Messages**: When raising exceptions, provide detailed and user-friendly messages that can guide the user to fix their input.\n\n   ```python\n   def process_items(items):\n       if not hasattr(items, '__iter__'):\n           raise TypeError(\"process_items expects an iterable. \"\n                           \"Received object of type: {}\".format(type(items).__name__))\n       for item in items:\n           if not hasattr(item, 'process'):\n               raise AttributeError(f\"Item {item} does not have a 'process' method.\")\n           item.process()\n   ```\n\n5. **Documentation and Examples**: Provide clear documentation and examples of how to use your library. Explain the expected interfaces and behaviors.\n\n6. **Logging**: Use logging to record errors and warnings, which can be invaluable for debugging and understanding how your library is used.\n\nBy following these practices, you can make your library more robust, user-friendly, and in line with Python's dynamic and flexible nature. Remember, Python's philosophy is \"It's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission\" (EAFP), which encourages trying to perform an operation and handling failures, rather than checking in advance if an operation will succeed."
