The algorithm must also take into account the fact that the fingerprints belong to someone who owns an iPhone 12 Pro, the suspect with the strongest motive does not own an iPhone 12 Pro, the suspect with the weakest alibi does not own an iPhone 12 Pro, and the suspect who was seen near the crime scene on the night of the murder does not own an iPhone 12 Pro. Please provide a detailed and step-by-step procedure or code using Go to determine the guilty party based on these additional constraints."

        "content": "To solve this problem, you need to match fingerprints found at the crime scene with those of the suspects while considering the additional constraints related to the ownership of an iPhone 12 Pro. This is a complex problem that involves both forensic analysis (fingerprint matching) and logical reasoning (based on the given constraints).\n\n### Step-by-step Approach\n\n1. **Fingerprint Matching Algorithm:**\n   - Use a fingerprint matching algorithm like Minutiae-based matching, which is commonly used for fingerprint recognition. This algorithm focuses on the minutiae points (ridge endings and bifurcations) in a fingerprint.\n\n2. **Setup Suspect Data:**\n   - Create a data structure to hold information about each suspect, including their fingerprints, whether they own an iPhone 12 Pro, their motive strength, their alibi strength, and whether they were seen near the crime scene.\n\n3. **Filter Suspects Based on Constraints:**\n   - First, filter out suspects who own an iPhone 12 Pro, as they cannot be the culprit according to the constraints.\n   - Ensure that the suspect with the strongest motive, weakest alibi, and who was seen near the crime scene are not considered if they own an iPhone 12 Pro.\n\n4. **Fingerprint Matching:**\n   - Use the fingerprint matching algorithm to compare the crime scene fingerprints against the remaining suspects' fingerprints.\n\n5. **Determine the Guilty Party:**\n   - From the filtered list of suspects, identify the one whose fingerprints match those found at the crime scene.\n\n### Example Code in Go\n\nBelow is an illustrative example of how this can be structured in Go. Note that the actual fingerprint matching algorithm is not implemented here due to its complexity and because it typically requires specialized libraries or tools.\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n)\n\n// Suspect represents a suspect with relevant details\ntype Suspect struct {\n\tName        string\n\tOwnsIPhone  bool\n\tMotive      int\n\tAlibi       int\n\tSeenAtScene bool\n\tFingerprint string // This would be more complex in a real application\n}\n\n// Mock function for fingerprint matching (for illustration)\nfunc matchFingerprints(fingerprint1, fingerprint2 string) bool {\n\treturn fingerprint1 == fingerprint2\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Define suspects\n\tsuspects := []Suspect{\n\t\t{\"Alice\", false, 3, 5, true, \"fp1\"},\n\t\t{\"Bob\", true, 4, 2, false, \"fp2\"},\n\t\t{\"Charlie\", false, 5, 1, false, \"fp3\"},\n\t\t{\"David\", false, 2, 4, false, \"fp4\"},\n\t}\n\n\t// Fingerprint found at the crime scene\n\tcrimeSceneFingerprint := \"fp3\"\n\n\t// Filter suspects based on constraints\n\tvar potentialSuspects []Suspect\n\tfor _, suspect := range suspects {\n\t\tif !suspect.OwnsIPhone {\n\t\t\tpotentialSuspects = append(potentialSuspects, suspect)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t// Match fingerprints\n\tvar guiltySuspect *Suspect\n\tfor _, suspect := range potentialSuspects {\n\t\tif matchFingerprints(suspect.Fingerprint, crimeSceneFingerprint) {\n\t\t\tguiltySuspect = &suspect\n\t\t\tbreak\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t// Output the result\n\tif guiltySuspect != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Printf(\"The guilty party is: %s\\n\", guiltySuspect.Name)\n\t} else {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"No matching suspect found.\")\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Data Structure:** `Suspect` struct holds information about each suspect.\n- **Filtering:** The suspects are filtered based on whether they own an iPhone 12 Pro.\n- **Fingerprint Matching:** A mock function `matchFingerprints` is used to illustrate matching. In a real scenario, this would be replaced with a proper fingerprint matching implementation.\n- **Output:** The program prints the name of the suspect whose fingerprints match those found at the crime scene, considering the constraints.\n\nThis code provides a basic framework. In real-world scenarios, a sophisticated library and proper forensic tools would be needed for fingerprint analysis."
