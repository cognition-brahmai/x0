I am currently able to refresh and open the file successfully, and I can print the sheet names and the number of sheets using the xlrd library. However, I'm not sure how to select the data from the first sheet starting from row 5, including headers, down to the last record.\n\nHere is the code I have so far:\n\n```python\nimport xlrd\n\nwb = xlrd.open_workbook('C:\\Users\\cb\\Machine_Learning\\cMap_Joins.xlsm')\n\n#sheetnames\nprint wb.sheet_names()\n\n#number of sheets\nprint wb.nsheets\n```"

        "content": "To import data from an Excel spreadsheet into a pandas DataFrame starting from a specific row, you can make use of the `pandas` library, which provides a convenient `read_excel` function that integrates with the `openpyxl` or `xlrd` engine to read Excel files. Since you want to start from row 5 and include headers, you can use the `skiprows` parameter to skip the first four rows (0-indexed), and then specify which row should be treated as the header. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\nFirst, ensure you have `pandas` and `openpyxl` installed, as they will be used to read the Excel file:\n\n```bash\npip install pandas openpyxl\n```\n\nThen, you can use the following code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the Excel file using pandas\nfile_path = 'C:\\\\Users\\\\cb\\\\Machine_Learning\\\\cMap_Joins.xlsm'\n\n# Read the first sheet, skipping the first four rows\ndf = pd.read_excel(file_path, sheet_name=0, skiprows=4)\n\n# Display the DataFrame\nprint(df)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`sheet_name=0`**: This specifies that you want to read the first sheet in the workbook. You can also use the sheet name as a string if you prefer.\n- **`skiprows=4`**: This skips the first four rows of the sheet, so the fifth row (index 4) becomes the header by default.\n- **`openpyxl`**: This library is used by `pandas` to read `.xlsx` and `.xlsm` files. Make sure you have it installed as `xlrd` no longer supports `.xlsx` or `.xlsm` files starting from version 2.0.\n\nThis code will create a DataFrame starting from the fifth row of the Excel sheet, treating that row as the header, and including all subsequent data. If you have specific columns to import or any additional formatting, you can explore further options within the `read_excel` function."
