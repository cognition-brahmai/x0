I want to access these config values in other files like `login.py`. I've tried importing the function as `app` and printing `app.config['SECRET_KEY']`, but it gives me an error `AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'config'`. How can I correctly access these config values from other files?"

        "content": "To access the configuration values from a Flask app in other parts of your application, you'll need to ensure that you're working with an instantiated Flask app object, not the `create_app` function itself. Here's how you can structure your application to achieve that:\n\n1. **Ensure `create_app()` is properly defined**: Your `create_app()` function should look something like this in `myapp/__init__.py`:\n\n    ```python\n    from flask import Flask\n\n    def create_app():\n        app = Flask(__name__)\n        \n        # Set configuration values\n        app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your_secret_key'\n        # Add other configuration values as needed\n\n        # Initialize extensions, blueprints, etc.\n\n        return app\n    ```\n\n2. **Access the app instance**: In your `login.py` or any other module where you need to access the configuration, you need to ensure that you're working with the app instance. Here's a common pattern to achieve this:\n\n    ```python\n    from flask import current_app\n\n    def some_function():\n        # Access configuration values using current_app\n        secret_key = current_app.config['SECRET_KEY']\n        print(secret_key)\n    ```\n\n   `current_app` is a proxy provided by Flask that gives you access to the app object associated with the active request context. This means `current_app` should only be used within a request context.\n\n3. **Setting up the application context**: If you need to access the configuration outside of a request context, you may need to push an application context manually. Here's how you can do it:\n\n    ```python\n    from myapp import create_app\n\n    app = create_app()\n\n    with app.app_context():\n        # Now you can access app's config\n        secret_key = app.config['SECRET_KEY']\n        print(secret_key)\n    ```\n\n4. **Common issues**: Make sure that your application is structured in a way that avoids circular imports. If you find you're having trouble with imports, consider organizing your code into blueprints or modules to keep your import paths clean.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to access your Flask app's configuration values from other files in your project."
