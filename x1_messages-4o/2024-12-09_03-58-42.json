        "content": "The error message you're encountering typically indicates that Docker is unable to assign an IP address to the network it is trying to create, due to a lack of available non-overlapping IP address space. This usually happens when there are too many Docker networks already created on your system, each consuming a piece of the IP address space.\n\nHere's how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Prune Unused Docker Networks**: Docker networks that are no longer in use can be pruned to free up IP address space.\n   - Use the following command to prune unused networks:\n     ```bash\n     docker network prune\n     ```\n   - This command will remove all unused networks. Ensure that your running containers are not using any of these networks before executing this command.\n\n2. **Inspect Existing Networks**: Check the existing Docker networks to see which ones are consuming IP address space.\n   - List all networks:\n     ```bash\n     docker network ls\n     ```\n   - Inspect a specific network to see its IP address range:\n     ```bash\n     docker network inspect <network_name>\n     ```\n\n3. **Remove Unnecessary Networks**: If there are networks that are no longer needed, remove them.\n   - Remove a specific network:\n     ```bash\n     docker network rm <network_name>\n     ```\n\n4. **Specify a Custom Subnet**: If you are frequently running into this issue, consider specifying a custom subnet for your Docker Compose network to avoid conflicts with existing networks.\n   - You can define a custom subnet in your `docker-compose.yml` file as follows:\n     ```yaml\n     networks:\n       default:\n         driver: bridge\n         ipam:\n           config:\n             - subnet: 172.25.0.0/16\n     ```\n   - Choose a subnet that is not overlapping with any existing networks.\n\n5. **Restart Docker**: Sometimes, simply restarting the Docker service can help resolve IP address allocation issues.\n   - Restart Docker on your system:\n     ```bash\n     sudo systemctl restart docker\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the IP address pool conflict and successfully run your `docker-compose up` command."
