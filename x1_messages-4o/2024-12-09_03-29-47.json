        "content": "There isn't a built-in method in Python specifically for reading a random line from a file, but you can accomplish this task using a few different approaches. One efficient way is to use the `random` module in combination with reading the file. Here's a simple method to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef read_random_line(file_path):\n    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n        lines = file.readlines()\n        if not lines:\n            return None  # Handle case where file might be empty\n        random_line = random.choice(lines)\n        return random_line.strip()\n\n# Example usage\nfile_path = 'your_file.txt'\nprint(read_random_line(file_path))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Read all lines:** The `file.readlines()` method reads all lines from the file into a list. This is efficient for relatively small to moderately sized files, but it may cause memory issues with very large files.\n\n2. **Random choice:** The `random.choice()` function selects a random element from the list of lines.\n\n3. **Handling empty files:** It checks if the file is empty to avoid potential errors.\n\n### Considerations\n\n- **For Large Files:** If the file is too large to fit into memory, you can first count the number of lines in the file and then choose a random line to read. Here\u2019s a memory-efficient approach:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef read_random_line_large_file(file_path):\n    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n        line_count = sum(1 for _ in file)\n    if line_count == 0:\n        return None\n    random_line_number = random.randint(0, line_count - 1)\n    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n        for current_line_number, line in enumerate(file):\n            if current_line_number == random_line_number:\n                return line.strip()\n\n# Example usage\nfile_path = 'your_large_file.txt'\nprint(read_random_line_large_file(file_path))\n```\n\nThis second method avoids loading the entire file into memory, making it suitable for very large files. It first counts the lines in the file, then picks a random line number, and finally reads through the file again to fetch just that line."
