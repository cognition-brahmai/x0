However, I'm encountering an ImportError stating - \"cannot import name 'DecisionBoundaryDisplay' from 'sklearn.inspection'\". I've tried upgrading the scikit-learn package and also installing scipy and matplotlib using the following commands - `!pip install --upgrade scikit-learn`, `!pip install scipy`, `!pip3 install -U scikit-learn scipy matplotlib`. I've also attempted restarting my runtime, but the error persists. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that the `DecisionBoundaryDisplay` class might not be available in the version of scikit-learn you have installed, or it might not exist under the path you specified. Here are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check scikit-learn version**: Ensure that you are using a version of scikit-learn that includes `DecisionBoundaryDisplay`. This class was introduced in scikit-learn 1.0, so you need at least this version. You can check your current version with:\n\n   ```python\n   import sklearn\n   print(sklearn.__version__)\n   ```\n\n2. **Upgrade scikit-learn**: If your version is below 1.0, upgrade it using the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   !pip install scikit-learn --upgrade\n   ```\n\n3. **Restart the runtime**: After upgrading, restart your Colab runtime to ensure the new version is used.\n\n4. **Correct import path**: Double-check the import path in case there is a typo or mis-specification.\n\n5. **Verify availability**: If the issue persists, verify if the `DecisionBoundaryDisplay` class is available in your current version by checking the scikit-learn documentation for your specific version.\n\n6. **Alternative Solutions**: If you are unable to upgrade to a version that supports `DecisionBoundaryDisplay`, you might need to use an alternative method to visualize decision boundaries, such as manually plotting them using matplotlib.\n\n7. **Example Code** (to check functionality):\n\n   ```python\n   from sklearn.datasets import make_classification\n   from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n   from sklearn.inspection import DecisionBoundaryDisplay\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n   # Create a simple dataset\n   X, y = make_classification(n_features=2, n_redundant=0, n_informative=2, n_clusters_per_class=1)\n   clf = LogisticRegression().fit(X, y)\n\n   # Plot decision boundary\n   disp = DecisionBoundaryDisplay.from_estimator(clf, X)\n   disp.ax_.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y, edgecolor='k')\n   plt.show()\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the ImportError and successfully use `DecisionBoundaryDisplay` in your Google Colab environment."
