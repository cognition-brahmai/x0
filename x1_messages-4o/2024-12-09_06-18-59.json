        "content": "To resolve the issue you're facing with `libcusolver.so.11`, you need to ensure that you have the correct version of CUDA installed that includes this library. The error indicates that TensorFlow is looking for `libcusolver.so.11`, which is part of CUDA 11.1 or later. Here's how you can address this:\n\n1. **Verify Your CUDA Version:**\n   First, check your current CUDA version to confirm if you need an upgrade.\n\n   ```bash\n   nvcc --version\n   ```\n\n   If it shows that you're on CUDA 11.0, you'll need to upgrade to at least CUDA 11.1.\n\n2. **Upgrade CUDA:**\n   Since you need `libcusolver.so.11`, you should upgrade to CUDA 11.1 or newer. Follow these steps:\n\n   - **Remove Existing CUDA:**\n\n     ```bash\n     sudo apt-get --purge remove \"*cublas*\" \"cuda*\"\n     ```\n\n   - **Install CUDA 11.1 or Newer:**\n     You can download the CUDA toolkit from the [NVIDIA Developer website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive).\n\n     Choose the version that includes `libcusolver.so.11` (CUDA 11.1 or newer). Follow the instructions provided on the download page for installation.\n\n3. **Configure TensorFlow with New CUDA:**\n   After installing the correct version of CUDA, configure TensorFlow to use it.\n\n   - Run the configuration script again:\n\n     ```bash\n     ./configure\n     ```\n\n   - Ensure that it detects the correct CUDA version and paths.\n\n4. **Rebuild TensorFlow:**\n   Once you've updated CUDA and reconfigured TensorFlow, rebuild it using Bazel:\n\n   ```bash\n   bazel clean\n   bazel build --config=v2 --config=cuda --config=monolithic --copt=-mavx --copt=-mavx2 --copt=-mfma --copt=-msse4.1 --copt=-msse4.2 --copt=-Wno-sign-compare //tensorflow:libtensorflow_cc.so\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify Installation:**\n   After the build completes, verify that TensorFlow is correctly installed and can utilize your GPU. You can do this by running a simple TensorFlow script to check GPU availability.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the error and successfully build TensorFlow with the required CUDA version."
