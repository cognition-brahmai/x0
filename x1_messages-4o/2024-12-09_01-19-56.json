Specifically, in my function where I return a list of permutations, I want to set the default `set_length` value equal to the value of the first argument passed in, `elements`. Here is my current code:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\ndef perms(elements, set_length=elements):\n    data=[]\n    for x in range(elements):\n        data.append(x+1)\n    return list(itertools.permutations(data, set_length))\n```\n\nI understand that the above code won't run because the second `elements` isn't defined, but is there an elegant way to accomplish what I'm trying to do here?"

        "content": "In Python, default parameter values are evaluated at the time the function is defined, not when the function is called. This means you can't directly reference other parameters in the default value assignment.\n\nHowever, you can achieve the desired behavior by setting the default value of `set_length` to `None` and then checking its value within the function. If it's `None`, you can set it to be equal to `elements`. Here's how you can modify your function:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef perms(elements, set_length=None):\n    data = list(range(1, elements + 1))\n    if set_length is None:\n        set_length = elements\n    return list(itertools.permutations(data, set_length))\n\n# Example usage:\nresult = perms(3)\nprint(result)  # Output: [(1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), (3, 2, 1)]\n```\n\nIn this modified function:\n\n- `set_length` is set to `None` by default.\n- Inside the function, we check if `set_length` is `None`, and if so, we set it equal to `elements`.\n- The `data` list is populated using `range(1, elements + 1)`, which is a more concise way to create a list of numbers from 1 to `elements`.\n\nThis approach ensures that if no `set_length` is provided, it defaults to the value of `elements`."
