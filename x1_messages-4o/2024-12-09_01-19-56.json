The challenge I am encountering is when a JSON file is not correctly formatted, which leads to an error (`ValueError: No JSON object could be decoded`). I am currently using the following code:\n\n```python\nfor files in folder:\n    with open(files) as f:\n        data = json.load(f); # It causes an error at this part\n```\n\nIs there a way to programmatically validate and format these JSON files? Or is there any free or cheap offline alternative that can fix all the JSON files in the folder and format them as required?"

        "content": "Handling malformed JSON files can be a challenge, but there are a few strategies you can employ to deal with them in Python or using external tools.\n\n### Strategy 1: Handling Errors in Python\n\nYou can modify your script to handle exceptions gracefully. This way, if a JSON file is malformed, the program will catch the error and you can decide what to do next, such as logging the error, skipping the file, or attempting to fix it.\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport os\n\nfor file in os.listdir(folder):\n    file_path = os.path.join(folder, file)\n    try:\n        with open(file_path) as f:\n            data = json.load(f)\n            # Process your data here\n    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n        print(f\"Error decoding JSON from file {file_path}: {e}\")\n        # Optionally, you can try to fix the JSON here or just continue\n```\n\n### Strategy 2: Attempt to Fix Common JSON Errors\n\nSometimes simple errors like trailing commas or missing quotes can be fixed programmatically. While this won't fix every issue, you can use regular expressions or specific libraries to attempt fixing common errors. Libraries like `demjson` or `jsonfix` can be useful.\n\n```sh\npip install demjson\n```\n\n```python\nimport demjson\nimport os\n\nfor file in os.listdir(folder):\n    file_path = os.path.join(folder, file)\n    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:\n        content = f.read()\n    try:\n        data = demjson.decode(content)\n        # Process your data here\n    except demjson.JSONDecodeError as e:\n        print(f\"Error parsing JSON from file {file_path}: {e}\")\n        # Optionally, try to manually fix or log the error\n```\n\n### Strategy 3: Use External Tools\n\n1. **Online Validators**: These might not be feasible for 2000 files, but websites like JSONLint can validate JSON.\n2. **CLI Tools**: Tools like `jq` or `jsonlint` can be used to validate JSON files via command line.\n3. **Python Scripts**: Use available scripts or libraries that try to repair JSON files. For example, `jsonfixer` is an online tool but you can find scripts that replicate similar functionality offline.\n\n### Strategy 4: Manual Inspection\n\nSometimes, manual inspection might be necessary. If you identify a common pattern that's causing the JSON to be malformed, you can script a solution for that specific case.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIt's crucial to first try to understand the nature of the errors in your JSON files. Are they consistent (e.g., always a trailing comma, or missing quotes)? Once you identify common patterns, you can custom-tailor your approach to handle them. If JSON files are being generated incorrectly by another system, it might also be worth investigating and fixing the issue at the source."
