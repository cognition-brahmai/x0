I have a dictionary that I declared in a particular order and I want it to stay in that order all the time. The keys/values can't really be kept in order based on their value, I just want it in the order that I declared it. Here is an example of my dictionary:\n\n```python\nd = {'ac': 33, 'gw': 20, 'ap': 102, 'za': 321, 'bs': 10}\n```\n\nHowever, when I view it or iterate through it, it doesn't maintain the order in which I declared the keys/values. Is there a way to ensure Python keeps the explicit order that I declared the keys/values in?"

        "content": "In Python 3.7 and later, dictionaries maintain the insertion order by default. This means that the order in which you declare the keys and values in your dictionary will be preserved when you iterate over the dictionary or view its items.\n\nHere's how you can verify this with your example:\n\n```python\nd = {'ac': 33, 'gw': 20, 'ap': 102, 'za': 321, 'bs': 10}\n\n# Iterating through the dictionary to print keys and values\nfor key, value in d.items():\n    print(key, value)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nac 33\ngw 20\nap 102\nza 321\nbs 10\n```\n\nAs you can see, the keys are printed in the order they were declared.\n\nIf you are using Python 3.6, note that while dictionaries maintain insertion order as an implementation detail, it is not guaranteed by the language specification. However, starting from Python 3.7, this behavior is guaranteed by the language specification.\n\nIf you're using a version prior to Python 3.6 and need to ensure the order, you can use `collections.OrderedDict`:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\n\nd = OrderedDict([('ac', 33), ('gw', 20), ('ap', 102), ('za', 321), ('bs', 10)])\n\nfor key, value in d.items():\n    print(key, value)\n```\n\n`OrderedDict` will maintain the order in which you add keys and values, ensuring the order is preserved even in versions of Python before 3.7. However, for modern versions, using a regular dictionary is sufficient to maintain order."
