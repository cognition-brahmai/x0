They are considering investing in a new product line that requires an initial investment of $10 million but is expected to generate $5 million in revenue per year for the next five years. The cost of capital for the company is 10%. Using PHP code, how would you calculate the net present value (NPV) of the investment and determine if the company should invest in the new product line?"

        "content": "To calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) of the investment, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the cash inflows from the investment.\n2. Discount the cash inflows to their present value using the company's cost of capital.\n3. Subtract the initial investment from the total present value of cash inflows to get the NPV.\n4. If the NPV is positive, the company should consider investing in the new product line; if it's negative, they should not.\n\nHere's a PHP script to calculate the NPV:\n\n```php\n<?php\n\nfunction calculateNPV($initialInvestment, $annualRevenue, $costOfCapital, $years) {\n    $npv = -$initialInvestment; // Start with the initial investment as a negative cash flow\n    for ($year = 1; $year <= $years; $year++) {\n        // Calculate the present value of each year's revenue\n        $presentValue = $annualRevenue / pow(1 + $costOfCapital, $year);\n        $npv += $presentValue; // Add the present value to NPV\n    }\n    return $npv;\n}\n\n$initialInvestment = 10000000; // Initial investment of $10 million\n$annualRevenue = 5000000; // Annual revenue of $5 million\n$costOfCapital = 0.10; // Cost of capital is 10%\n$years = 5; // The revenue is expected for 5 years\n\n$npv = calculateNPV($initialInvestment, $annualRevenue, $costOfCapital, $years);\n\necho \"The NPV of the investment is: $\" . number_format($npv, 2) . \"\\n\";\n\nif ($npv > 0) {\n    echo \"The company should invest in the new product line.\";\n} else {\n    echo \"The company should not invest in the new product line.\";\n}\n\n?>\n```\n\nIn this script:\n\n- We define a function `calculateNPV` that takes the initial investment, annual revenue, cost of capital, and the number of years as arguments.\n- The NPV is initialized with the negative value of the initial investment.\n- For each year, the present value of the expected revenue is calculated using the formula for present value: \\( \\text{Present Value} = \\frac{\\text{Annual Revenue}}{(1 + \\text{Cost of Capital})^{\\text{Year}}} \\).\n- The present value for each year is added to the NPV.\n- Finally, if the NPV is positive, it suggests that the investment is worthwhile.\n\nRun this PHP code to get the NPV and determine if the investment should be made. If the NPV is greater than zero, it's a good investment opportunity."
