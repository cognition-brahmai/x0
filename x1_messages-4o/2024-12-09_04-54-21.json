        "content": "I'm trying to understand how dict.copy() works in Python. According to the Python documentation and Beazley's Python Reference, it makes a shallow copy of the dictionary. However, when I tried to use it, it doesn't seem to behave as I expected. For example, when I create a dictionary, make a copy of it using dict.copy(), and then update the copy, the original dictionary does not get updated. This is not the case when I do the same thing with a list - when I append an item to the copied list, the original list also gets updated. Both are supposed to be shallow copies, so why is the behavior different?\n\nHere's the dictionary code:\n\n```\n>>> original = dict(a=1, b=2)\n>>> new = original.copy()\n>>> new.update({'c': 3})\n>>> original\n{'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n>>> new\n{'a': 1, 'c': 3, 'b': 2}\n```\n\nAnd here's the list code:\n\n```\n>>> original = [1, 2, 3]\n>>> new = original\n>>> new.append(4)\n>>> new, original\n([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4])\n```\n\nCould you help me understand why dict.copy() doesn't work as I expect it to? Or is my understanding of shallow vs deep copying flawed?"

        "content": "The difference you're observing between the behavior of lists and dictionaries in your examples is not actually related to shallow versus deep copying, but rather about how assignment and copying work in Python.\n\n### Lists\n\nIn your list example:\n\n```python\noriginal = [1, 2, 3]\nnew = original\nnew.append(4)\n```\n\nHere, `new = original` does not create a copy of the list. Instead, `new` is just another reference to the same list object that `original` refers to. Therefore, when you modify `new` using `append(4)`, it affects the same list that `original` refers to. That's why both `new` and `original` reflect the change.\n\n### Dictionaries\n\nIn your dictionary example:\n\n```python\noriginal = dict(a=1, b=2)\nnew = original.copy()\nnew.update({'c': 3})\n```\n\nHere, `original.copy()` creates a shallow copy of the dictionary. This means that a new dictionary object is created, and the top-level keys and values are copied over. However, since dictionaries and their keys/values are themselves immutable in this case, the shallow copy is effectively a full copy for your purposes. \n\nWhen you update `new` with `new.update({'c': 3})`, you are only modifying the copy, and not the original dictionary. This is why the original dictionary remains unchanged.\n\n### Shallow vs Deep Copy\n\n- **Shallow Copy**: This copies the outer container, but not the elements inside if they are mutable objects (like lists, other dictionaries, etc.). For example, if you have a dictionary with lists as values, the lists themselves wouldn\u2019t be copied\u2014just the references to these lists would be.\n  \n- **Deep Copy**: This copies both the outer container and the elements inside, recursively. You can create a deep copy using the `copy` module in Python:\n\n  ```python\n  import copy\n  new = copy.deepcopy(original)\n  ```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn your specific case, `dict.copy()` is doing exactly what it's supposed to do: creating a new dictionary with the same key-value pairs as the original. The reason your list example behaves differently is due to the assignment `new = original`, which doesn't involve copying but rather sharing the same reference. To create a shallow copy of a list, you can use `new = original[:]` or `new = original.copy()`."
