I've come across differing opinions, with some stating that pinning dependencies versions can prevent users from upgrading those dependencies, while others suggest it's the best way to ensure your release works as expected and avoid potential issues from a breaking change in a dependency. I've currently opted for a hybrid solution, using semantic versioning and only pinning the major version number, unless it is '0'. Is there an official guideline or Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) that provides best practices for specifying Python dependencies?"

        "content": "When releasing a Python library, handling dependencies is crucial to ensure that users can integrate your library smoothly while also maintaining stability. There is indeed some debate around whether to pin dependencies, and your hybrid approach is a common strategy. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the considerations and some guidance based on best practices and relevant PEPs:\n\n1. **Semantic Versioning**: Using semantic versioning is a good practice. The idea is to specify dependencies in a way that allows for compatibility with future updates. For example, if a library follows semantic versioning, specifying a dependency like `requests>=2.0.0,<3.0.0` would allow for any minor or patch updates within version 2, which should be backward compatible.\n\n2. **Pinning vs. Non-pinning**: \n   - **Pinning dependencies** (e.g., `requests==2.25.1`) ensures that your library always runs with the tested versions of its dependencies. This can prevent unexpected issues caused by changes in dependencies.\n   - **Non-pinning dependencies** allow users more flexibility and can help ensure that your library works with the latest patches and minor updates of a dependency, which often include important security fixes.\n\n3. **PEP 508**: This PEP provides a standard for specifying dependencies in a way that can include version specifiers. It encourages specifying versions in a flexible manner, often using range specifiers to allow for updates that are backward-compatible.\n\n4. **PEP 440**: This PEP provides a detailed specification for versioning in Python, including how to use version specifiers correctly. It supports the use of version ranges, which you are already considering.\n\n5. **Best Practices**:\n   - **For Libraries**: Generally, it's recommended to avoid pinning dependencies strictly in libraries. Instead, use version specifiers to define compatible ranges.\n   - **For Applications**: Pinning can be more appropriate for applications where you want to ensure a specific set of dependencies that have been thoroughly tested together.\n\n6. **Development vs. Production**: In development, you might pin dependencies to ensure a consistent environment. For production releases, using version ranges is typically more beneficial.\n\n7. **Use of Tools**: Consider using tools like `pip-tools` or `poetry` for managing dependencies. They can help you maintain a balance between flexibility and stability by generating a `requirements.txt` file from a `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` with pinned versions for development purposes.\n\nIn conclusion, your approach of using semantic versioning and pinning only when necessary aligns well with common practices. By specifying ranges, you allow for flexibility while maintaining compatibility. Always keep an eye on your dependencies' release notes for breaking changes and test your library accordingly."
