        "content": "The error you're encountering, `TypeError: sequence item 0: expected string, NoneType found`, usually occurs when you are attempting to concatenate or join a list of items where one or more of those items are `None`. This often happens when dealing with lists or strings in Python. Let's look into possible causes and solutions for your issue:\n\n1. **Check the PrintBoards Function:**\n   - Review the `PrintBoards` function to ensure that it is not trying to join or concatenate elements that might be `None`. For example, if you are using `''.join()` or `str.join()`, ensure that all elements in the sequence are strings.\n\n2. **Debugging the Ship Placement:**\n   - Examine the ship placement logic to ensure that all board cells are being initialized correctly and hold valid values (e.g., \".\", \"S\", \"X\", etc.) rather than `None`.\n   - Ensure that when your ships are placed on the board, they are actually being marked with a string, such as \"S\" for ship, rather than inadvertently leaving some cells as `None`.\n\n3. **Initialize the Board Properly:**\n   - Ensure that the board is initialized with a default value (such as \".\") rather than `None`, so that any unoccupied cell holds a valid string value.\n\n4. **PrintBoards Logic:**\n   - If the `PrintBoards` function is supposed to print the board, verify that it handles the board data correctly, especially if you are converting elements to strings or iterating over them for output.\n\n5. **Example Fix:**\n   - If your board is a list of lists, make sure that each element is initialized to a string value:\n     ```python\n     board = [[\".\" for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]\n     ```\n\n6. **Check for None Values:**\n   - Add checks in your code to identify and handle cases where a `None` value might be introduced.\n\nIf you can provide the relevant parts of your code, particularly the `PrintBoards` function and the ship placement logic, I can offer more specific guidance. Debugging the specific lines where the error occurs will also reveal which part of your code is introducing `None` values."
