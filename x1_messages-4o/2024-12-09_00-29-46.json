        "content": "To achieve your desired output without manually iterating through the list to remove duplicates, you can use a set to automatically handle the uniqueness of combinations. Here\u2019s how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nt = [2, 2, 2, 2, 4]\n# Use a set to store unique combinations\nc = set(itertools.combinations(t, 4))\n\n# Convert back to a list if needed\nc = list(c)\n\n# Print the result\nfor combo in c:\n    print(combo)\n```\n\nBy using a set, duplicates are automatically removed because sets do not allow duplicate elements. This way, you don\u2019t have to manually iterate through the combinations to eliminate duplicates. The resulting output will be:\n\n```python\n(2, 2, 2, 2)\n(2, 2, 2, 4)\n```\n\nNote that the order of the output combinations might differ because sets do not preserve order. If order matters, you could sort the list of unique combinations after converting it back from the set:\n\n```python\nc = sorted(c)\n```"
