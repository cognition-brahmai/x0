While it supports code highlighting and the embedding of LaTeX formulas in HTML through MathJax, I find it lacking a functionality that R Markdown offers - the ability to execute R code inline and automatically render the results or graphs in HTML. This feature in R Markdown makes documentation maintenance convenient as there is no need to manually prepare the output or graphs. Is there a library or a way in Python, possibly in combination with Mistune, that provides similar functionality?"

        "content": "To achieve similar functionality in Python as R Markdown, where you can execute code inline and automatically render results or graphs in HTML, you can use a combination of several libraries and tools. Here are some options you can consider:\n\n1. **Jupyter Notebook + nbconvert**: Jupyter Notebooks allow you to execute Python code inline and display the results or graphs directly in the notebook. You can then convert the notebook to HTML using `nbconvert`. While this is not exactly the same as Markdown, it provides a similar interactive and executable document experience.\n\n   - Install Jupyter: `pip install notebook`\n   - Create and execute your notebook.\n   - Convert to HTML: `jupyter nbconvert --to html your_notebook.ipynb`\n\n2. **Pweave**: Pweave is a literate programming tool for Python, similar to R Markdown. It allows you to weave Python code into a document and execute it to produce a report in HTML or other formats.\n\n   - Install Pweave: `pip install pweave`\n   - Create a Pweave document with Python code blocks.\n   - Execute and convert to HTML: `pweave -f html your_document.pmd`\n\n3. **Jupytext**: Jupytext allows you to pair Jupyter Notebooks with Markdown documents, enabling synchronization between them. This way, you can write Markdown and execute code in a Jupyter Notebook environment.\n\n   - Install Jupytext: `pip install jupytext`\n   - Pair your Markdown file with a Jupyter Notebook: `jupytext --set-formats ipynb,md your_file.md`\n   - Execute the notebook and save the outputs.\n\n4. **Python-Markdown with Extensions**: You can use the `markdown` library in Python with custom extensions to execute code blocks. One such extension is `markdown-kernel`, which allows code execution.\n\n   - Install Python-Markdown and markdown-kernel: `pip install markdown markdown-kernel`\n   - Configure `markdown-kernel` to execute code blocks and produce output in HTML.\n\nThese tools provide ways to embed and execute Python code within Markdown-like documents and generate HTML outputs. Depending on your specific needs and workflow, you can choose the tool that best fits your use case."
