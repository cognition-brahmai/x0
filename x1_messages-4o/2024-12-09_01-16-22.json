I am unable to get WSGI to import my settings file for my project 'mofin'. I am getting a list of errors from the apache error log. The \"hello world!\" WSGI app listed works fine. The settings.py file loads fine with python manage.py (runserver|shell|syncdb|test store) as does the application. I am providing my wsgi file and django settings file for reference."

        "content": "To resolve the `ImportError: Could not import settings 'mofin.settings'` when using Django with WSGI, there are several steps and checks you can perform:\n\n1. **Check Python Path**: Ensure that your Python path includes the directory containing your Django project. You can do this by adding the following lines to your WSGI file:\n\n    ```python\n    import sys\n    import os\n\n    sys.path.append('/path/to/your/project')\n    sys.path.append('/path/to/your/project/mofin')  # If your settings.py is inside the 'mofin' directory\n    ```\n\n2. **Set Django Settings Module**: Make sure to set the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable in your WSGI file. It should look like this:\n\n    ```python\n    os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'mofin.settings')\n    ```\n\n3. **Check for File Permissions**: Ensure that the user under which Apache is running has read and execute permissions for your project\u2019s directory and files.\n\n4. **Virtual Environment**: If you are using a virtual environment, make sure it is activated within your WSGI file. You can do this by adding:\n\n    ```python\n    activate_this = '/path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/activate_this.py'\n    exec(open(activate_this).read(), {'__file__': activate_this})\n    ```\n\n5. **Check for Typos**: Double-check the spelling of your settings module (`mofin.settings`) in your WSGI file and make sure it matches the actual directory structure.\n\n6. **Check Apache Configuration**: Ensure that the Apache configuration file (e.g., `httpd.conf` or a site-specific config file) has the correct `WSGIScriptAlias` and points to your `wsgi.py` file.\n\n    Example:\n\n    ```apache\n    WSGIScriptAlias / /path/to/your/project/mofin/wsgi.py\n    ```\n\n7. **Error Logs**: Check the Apache error logs for any additional information that might give more clues about the specific issue.\n\n8. **Django Version Compatibility**: Ensure that the Django version you are using is compatible with your Python version and installed correctly in your virtual environment.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `ImportError` and get your Django application running with WSGI. If you continue to experience issues, double-check each step and ensure that all paths and environment variables are set correctly."
