        "content": "Django's built-in permission system provides basic permissions for each model: \"add\", \"change\", and \"delete\". However, there is no default \"view\" permission in Django. To implement a \"view\" or \"read\" permission, you can take several approaches:\n\n1. **Custom Permissions**: You can create custom permissions and apply them to your models. This involves defining a new permission in the `Meta` class of your model.\n\n    ```python\n    class MyModel(models.Model):\n        # Your model fields here\n\n        class Meta:\n            permissions = [\n                (\"view_mymodel\", \"Can view MyModel\"),\n            ]\n    ```\n\n    After defining the custom permission, you need to run `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate` to apply the changes.\n\n2. **Django Guardian**: For object-level permissions, you might consider using a third-party package like Django Guardian, which provides per-object permissions and might be helpful in creating more granular access controls.\n\n3. **Custom Admin Views**: Customize the Django admin by overriding the `has_view_permission` method in your admin class. This method doesn\u2019t exist by default, but you can create it to control view-only access.\n\n    ```python\n    from django.contrib import admin\n\n    class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n        # Override this method to implement view-only access\n        def has_view_permission(self, request, obj=None):\n            # Logic to determine if the user has view permission\n            return True  # or some condition based on request.user\n\n        def has_add_permission(self, request):\n            return False\n\n        def has_change_permission(self, request, obj=None):\n            return False\n\n        def has_delete_permission(self, request, obj=None):\n            return False\n\n    admin.site.register(MyModel, MyModelAdmin)\n    ```\n\n4. **Custom Middleware or Decorators**: Implement middleware or decorators that enforce view permissions on your views, including those in the admin panel.\n\nAfter setting up your view permissions, ensure that your users are assigned the appropriate permissions. You can do this via the Django admin interface or programmatically using Django's permission management API.\n\nThis setup allows you to grant users the ability to view models in the admin panel without giving them the ability to add, change, or delete any records."
