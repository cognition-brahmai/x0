        "content": "In Python, the `float` data type is implemented using double-precision (64-bit) floating-point numbers, which are based on the IEEE 754 standard. The range of possible values for a `float` in Python is:\n\n- The smallest positive normalized float is approximately \\(2.2250738585072014 \\times 10^{-308}\\).\n- The largest finite float is approximately \\(1.7976931348623157 \\times 10^{308}\\).\n\nAdditionally, Python floats can represent special values such as positive or negative infinity (`inf` or `-inf`) and NaN (Not a Number).\n\nYou can access these limits using the `sys` module:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nprint(sys.float_info.min)  # Smallest positive normalized float\nprint(sys.float_info.max)  # Largest positive float\n```\n\nThese values give you an idea of the range and limitations of floating-point numbers in Python."
