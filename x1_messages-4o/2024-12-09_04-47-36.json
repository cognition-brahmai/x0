When I apply the 'locale.atof' function to a single column in the DataFrame, it works as expected and I get a Series of floats. However, when I apply the function to the entire DataFrame or even a slice of the DataFrame, I get errors. How can I convert the entire DataFrame of string numbers to a DataFrame of floats?\n\nHere is the code I'm working with and the errors I am encountering:\n\nCreating the DataFrame:\n```python\na = [['1,200', '4,200'], ['7,000', '-0.03'], [ '5', '0']]\ndf = pandas.DataFrame(a)\n```\n\nApplying 'locale.atof' to a single column:\n```python\ndf[0].apply(locale.atof)\n```\n\nApplying 'locale.atof' to the entire DataFrame:\n```python\ndf.apply(locale.atof)\n```\nThis results in a TypeError: \"cannot convert the series to \", occurred at index 0\n\nAnd applying 'locale.atof' to a slice of the DataFrame:\n```python\ndf[0:1].apply(locale.atof)\n```\nThis results in a ValueError: 'invalid literal for float(): 1,200', occurred at index 0"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that `locale.atof` is designed to work with individual strings, not with entire pandas Series or DataFrames directly. When you're applying it to the whole DataFrame, pandas tries to apply the function across the entire DataFrame structure, which leads to errors.\n\nTo convert the entire DataFrame of string numbers with commas as thousands separators into floats, you can use the `applymap` function. This function applies a given function element-wise across the DataFrame. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport locale\n\n# Set the locale to handle commas as thousands separators\nlocale.setlocale(locale.LC_NUMERIC, '')\n\n# Create the DataFrame\na = [['1,200', '4,200'], ['7,000', '-0.03'], ['5', '0']]\ndf = pd.DataFrame(a)\n\n# Define a function to convert using locale.atof\ndef convert_to_float(cell):\n    try:\n        return locale.atof(cell)\n    except ValueError:\n        return float(cell)\n\n# Apply the conversion function to each element in the DataFrame\ndf_converted = df.applymap(convert_to_float)\n\nprint(df_converted)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`locale.setlocale(locale.LC_NUMERIC, '')`**: This sets the locale for numeric operations to the user's default setting (usually based on the environment variable).\n- **`applymap`**: This method is used to apply a function to each element of the DataFrame.\n- **`convert_to_float`**: This helper function attempts to convert each cell using `locale.atof`. If it encounters a `ValueError`, which can happen if a number doesn't have a comma or is already a simple float-like string, it falls back to using the `float` function.\n\nThis approach will ensure that all string representations of numbers with commas are converted to floats correctly across the entire DataFrame."
