The fence material costs $10 per foot for the length and $15 per foot for the width. What is the total cost of the fence material? \nHint: Think about the cost of each side separately and use algebra to solve for the length and width."

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to first find the dimensions of the garden, and then calculate the total cost of the fence material.\n\n1. **Find the dimensions:**\n\n   Let's denote the width of the garden as \\( W \\) feet. According to the problem, the length \\( L \\) is twice the width, so we have:\n   \\[\n   L = 2W\n   \\]\n\n   The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:\n   \\[\n   P = 2L + 2W\n   \\]\n\n   We know the perimeter is 52 feet:\n   \\[\n   2L + 2W = 52\n   \\]\n\n   Substitute \\( L = 2W \\) into the perimeter equation:\n   \\[\n   2(2W) + 2W = 52\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   4W + 2W = 52\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   6W = 52\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   W = \\frac{52}{6} = \\frac{26}{3} \\approx 8.67 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n   Now, find the length:\n   \\[\n   L = 2W = 2 \\times \\frac{26}{3} = \\frac{52}{3} \\approx 17.33 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the total cost:**\n\n   The cost of the fence is different for the length and the width. The cost for the length is $10 per foot, and for the width, it is $15 per foot.\n\n   - The total cost for the length sides (2 lengths):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost for length} = 2 \\times L \\times 10 = 2 \\times \\frac{52}{3} \\times 10 = \\frac{1040}{3} \\approx 346.67 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n   - The total cost for the width sides (2 widths):\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cost for width} = 2 \\times W \\times 15 = 2 \\times \\frac{26}{3} \\times 15 = \\frac{780}{3} = 260 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\n   - Total cost:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total cost} = 346.67 + 260 = 606.67 \\text{ dollars}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the total cost of the fence material is approximately $606.67."
