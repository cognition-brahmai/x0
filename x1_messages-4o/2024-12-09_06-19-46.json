        "content": "In Python, the `round()` function rounds to the nearest even number when dealing with .5 cases, which is why you're seeing it round down with `round(2.3)`. The `int(number + .5)` trick is not a reliable way to round up either, especially with numbers less than .5.\n\nIf you want to always round up to the nearest integer, you can use the `math.ceil()` function from the `math` module. This function rounds a number up to the nearest integer, regardless of its fractional component. Here\u2019s how you can use it:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nnumber = 2.3\nrounded_up = math.ceil(number)\nprint(rounded_up)  # Output: 3\n```\n\nThis will ensure that any number with a fractional component is rounded up to the next whole number."
