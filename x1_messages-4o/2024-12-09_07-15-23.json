Is there a way I could do something like:\n\n```python\nfor fieldName, errorMessage in form.errors:\n    ...do something\n```\nSo, how can I loop through all form errors in WTForms without specifying each field manually?"

        "content": "Yes, you can loop through all form errors in WTForms without specifying each field manually by iterating over the `form.errors` dictionary. This dictionary contains field names as keys and lists of error messages as values. You can use the `items()` method to loop through both the field names and their associated error messages. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfor field_name, error_messages in form.errors.items():\n    for error in error_messages:\n        print(f\"Field: {field_name}, Error: {error}\")\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, `form.errors.items()` returns a view object that displays a list of a dictionary's key-value tuple pairs. You loop through this view object to get each field name and its corresponding list of error messages. Then, you can loop through each list of error messages and handle them as needed.\n\nThis approach allows you to dynamically access and handle errors for any field in your form without needing to know the field names beforehand."
