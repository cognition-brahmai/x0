Specifically, I am trying to integrate Google's Machine Learning with an App Engine application written in Python. This application should retrain TensorFlow models before every use because of its investigation nature which involves data clusterization using Kohonen's SOM. Can an App Engine based app command the Machine Learning to train some model with some input data? Also, can an App Engine based app send some input vector into the Machine Learning and get the result of which cluster this vector belongs to? If all of this is possible, how can I do it? If not, is there any other architecture I can use to make an App Engine based app use TensorFlow?"

        "content": "Yes, it is possible for Google App Engine applications to interact with and control machine learning models and tasks, including those built with TensorFlow. Although App Engine itself is not specifically designed for heavy machine learning tasks, you can integrate it with other Google Cloud services to achieve your goals. Here's a general architecture and approach you can use:\n\n1. **Use Google Cloud Storage for Data**: Store your input data and trained models in Google Cloud Storage. This will allow your App Engine application to access the data and models as needed.\n\n2. **Use Google Cloud AI Platform**: Google Cloud AI Platform (previously known as AI Platform) provides tools for training, deploying, and managing machine learning models. You can use AI Platform to train your TensorFlow models, including Kohonen's Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), and deploy them for serving.\n\n3. **Training the Model**:\n   - Use AI Platform's training service to train your TensorFlow model. You can initiate training jobs from your App Engine application by using the Google Cloud SDK or the AI Platform's REST API.\n   - You can configure your training jobs to use your data from Cloud Storage and save the trained models back to Cloud Storage.\n\n4. **Model Serving**:\n   - Deploy your trained model to AI Platform's Prediction service. This service can host your model and provide a REST API for making predictions.\n   - Your App Engine application can send input vectors to this API and receive the prediction results, such as the cluster assignments.\n\n5. **Orchestration with App Engine**:\n   - Implement the logic in your App Engine application to decide when to trigger retraining. This could be based on specific conditions or schedules.\n   - Use Cloud Pub/Sub or Cloud Tasks if you need to manage background tasks or asynchronous operations.\n\n6. **Alternative Architecture**:\n   - If frequent retraining is required and the model is lightweight, consider using Cloud Functions to handle the retraining task, triggered by events such as data updates in Cloud Storage.\n   - Alternatively, use Kubernetes Engine with TensorFlow Serving if you need more control over the model serving process.\n\nHere is a basic outline of how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom google.cloud import storage, aiplatform\n\ndef train_model():\n    # Configure your AI Platform training job\n    job = aiplatform.CustomTrainingJob(\n        display_name='my_training_job',\n        script_path='train.py',\n        container_uri='gcr.io/cloud-aiplatform/training/tf-cpu.2-3:latest',\n        requirements=['tensorflow-addons']\n    )\n    \n    # Run the training job\n    model = job.run(\n        dataset=my_dataset,\n        model_display_name='my_model',\n    )\n    \n    return model\n\ndef predict(input_vector):\n    # Initialize the AI Platform Prediction client\n    endpoint = aiplatform.Endpoint(\"your_endpoint_id\")\n    \n    # Make a prediction\n    prediction = endpoint.predict(instances=[input_vector])\n    \n    return prediction\n\n# Example usage in your App Engine app\ndef main():\n    model = train_model()\n    input_vector = [...]  # Your input data\n    result = predict(input_vector)\n    print(f\"Input vector belongs to cluster: {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\nBy following this architecture, you can effectively manage the retraining of your models and make predictions using Google Cloud's suite of machine learning tools integrated with your App Engine application."
