Here is my code:\n\n```python\nimport threading\nfrom gevent import monkey; monkey.patch_all()\n\nclass ExampleThread(threading.Thread):\n    def run(self):\n        do_stuff()  # takes a few minutes to finish\n        print 'finished working'\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    worker = ExampleThread()\n    worker.start()\n    print 'this should be printed before the worker finished'\n```\n\nThe thread doesn't seem to be working as expected. However, if I remove the `monkey.patch_all()`, it works fine. The issue is that I need the `monkey.patch_all()` for using gevent. How can I solve this problem?"

        "content": "When using `gevent`, it's important to understand that monkey patching modifies the behavior of Python's standard library to make it cooperative. This means that if you are running blocking code without yielding control back to the gevent hub (for example, with `gevent.sleep()`), it may not allow other greenlets (or threads) to run concurrently, giving the appearance of serial execution.\n\nHere are a few strategies you can use to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Identify Blocking Code**: Ensure that the `do_stuff()` function does not contain any blocking calls that aren't patched or handled cooperatively. If it does, consider refactoring the code to yield control back to the event loop using `gevent.sleep()` or similar cooperative constructs.\n\n2. **Use Gevent Threads (Greenlets)**: Instead of using Python's native `threading.Thread`, you can use `gevent.spawn()` to start greenlets, which are more compatible with `gevent`.\n\n   Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n   ```python\n   import gevent\n   from gevent import monkey; monkey.patch_all()\n\n   def do_stuff():\n       # Simulating a blocking operation\n       gevent.sleep(120)  # Replace this with actual work\n\n   def worker():\n       do_stuff()\n       print('finished working')\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       g = gevent.spawn(worker)\n       print('this should be printed before the worker finished')\n       g.join()\n   ```\n\n3. **Selective Patching**: You might not need to patch everything. If you specifically need some libraries to be patched, selectively patch those and leave others as-is to retain normal threading behavior where needed.\n\n4. **Break Down Long Tasks**: If possible, break down the `do_stuff()` function into smaller tasks that can yield periodically, allowing other greenlets to run.\n\nBy refactoring your code to use gevent's concurrency model more effectively, you should be able to achieve the desired behavior."
