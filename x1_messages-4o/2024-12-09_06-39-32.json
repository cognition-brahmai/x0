In my Python script, I have a line that reads `sys.exit(myString)`. I attempted to store the output in a bash script using `outputString=`python myPythonScript arg1 arg2 arg3``. However, when I check the value of `outputString` with `echo $outputString`, I don't get the return value `myString`, but everything that the Python script had printed to the screen. I need the returned string because it tells me where a file created by the Python script is located. I want to use it in the following way:\n\n```bash\nfileLocation=`python myPythonScript1 arg1 arg2 arg1`\npython myPythonScript2 $fileLocation\n```\n\nHow can I correctly store the return value of a Python script in a bash script?"

        "content": "When you use `sys.exit()` in a Python script, it returns an integer exit code to the operating system, which is not suitable for passing a string value. If you want to pass a string from a Python script to a bash script, you'll need to print the string to standard output and capture that output in your bash script. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Modify Your Python Script**: Instead of using `sys.exit(myString)`, you should simply print the string `myString` to standard output.\n\n    ```python\n    # your_python_script.py\n    import sys\n\n    myString = \"path/to/your/file\"\n    print(myString)\n    ```\n\n2. **Capture the Output in Your Bash Script**: Use command substitution to capture the output of the Python script.\n\n    ```bash\n    # your_bash_script.sh\n    fileLocation=$(python myPythonScript1 arg1 arg2 arg3)\n    python myPythonScript2 \"$fileLocation\"\n    ```\n\n3. **Ensure Proper Quoting**: Use double quotes around the variable `\"$fileLocation\"` to handle any spaces or special characters in the file path correctly.\n\nWith these modifications, the Python script will print the string to standard output, and the bash script will capture that output into the `fileLocation` variable. This way, you can use the returned string as needed in your bash script."
