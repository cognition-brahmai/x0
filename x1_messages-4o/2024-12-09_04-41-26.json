I am following a Django tutorial that instructed me to run \"manage.py reset todo; manage.py syncdb\" whenever there are changes in the table layout. However, when I run \"manage.py reset todo\", I receive an error saying \"Unknown command: 'reset'\". Is this due to me using sqlite3 instead of postgresql? What is the correct command to reset the database? I've also tried running \"python manage.py sqlclear todo\", but it returns the error \"App with label todo could not be found. Are you sure your INSTALLED_APPS setting is correct?\". After adding 'todo' to my INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py and rerunning the command, I got a new error: \"NameError: name 'admin' is not defined\"."

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to changes in Django's management commands over various versions. The `reset` command was removed in Django 1.9, and `syncdb` was also deprecated and replaced by `migrate` since Django 1.7. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to reset your database correctly in modern Django versions:\n\n1. **Remove Migrations:**\n   - First, you need to remove any existing migration files. These are typically located in the `migrations` directory inside each app directory (except for the `__init__.py` file). Do not delete the `migrations` folder itself, just the migration files within it.\n\n2. **Drop the Database:**\n   - If you're using SQLite and want to completely reset the database, you can simply delete the database file (e.g., `db.sqlite3`).\n\n3. **Recreate the Database:**\n   - Run the following commands to recreate your database tables and make initial migrations:\n     ```bash\n     python manage.py makemigrations\n     python manage.py migrate\n     ```\n\n4. **Check INSTALLED_APPS:**\n   - Ensure that your `INSTALLED_APPS` list in `settings.py` includes all the necessary apps. For instance, if your app is named `todo`, it should be listed there.\n\n5. **Handle the NameError:**\n   - The `NameError: name 'admin' is not defined` might be related to some misconfiguration or typo in your code. Ensure that any references to `admin` are correctly imported. For example, ensure you have `from django.contrib import admin` in your `admin.py` file.\n\n6. **Recreate Superuser and Test Data:**\n   - If you had a superuser or test data, you\u2019ll need to recreate them. Use:\n     ```bash\n     python manage.py createsuperuser\n     ```\n\n7. **Run the Development Server:**\n   - Finally, run your development server to ensure everything is working fine:\n     ```bash\n     python manage.py runserver\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to reset your database and resolve any issues related to database schema changes in Django."
