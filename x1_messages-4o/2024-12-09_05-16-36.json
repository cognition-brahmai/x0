I have a function defined as follows:\n\n```python\ndef EOQ(D,p,ck,ch):\n    Q = math.sqrt((2*D*ck)/(ch*p))\n    return Q\n```\n\nI have a dataframe:\n\n```python\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\"D\": [10,20,30], \"p\": [20, 30, 10]})\n```\n\nThe dataframe looks like this:\n\n|   | D |  p |\n|---|---|----|\n| 0 |10 | 20 |\n| 1 |20 | 30 |\n| 2 |30 | 10 |\n\nI also have two float type variables `ch=0.2` and `ck=5`. I want to apply the function to every row on the dataframe and return it as an extra column 'Q'. I tried it with the following code, but it only returns 'map' types:\n\n```python\ndf['Q']= map(lambda p, D: EOQ(D,p,ck,ch),df['p'], df['D'])\n```\n\nI need this type of processing for my project. Can you guide me how to correctly apply a function to every row in a dataframe?"

        "content": "Certainly! The issue you're encountering is because the `map` function in Python returns an iterator, and you're not converting it to a list or a series which can be added as a column to the DataFrame. \n\nTo apply the function to each row of the DataFrame and store the results in a new column, you can use the `apply` method available in pandas. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport math\n\n# Define the EOQ function\ndef EOQ(D, p, ck, ch):\n    Q = math.sqrt((2 * D * ck) / (ch * p))\n    return Q\n\n# Create the DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\"D\": [10, 20, 30], \"p\": [20, 30, 10]})\n\n# Define the constants\nch = 0.2\nck = 5\n\n# Apply the function row-wise and store the result in a new column 'Q'\ndf['Q'] = df.apply(lambda row: EOQ(row['D'], row['p'], ck, ch), axis=1)\n\n# Display the updated DataFrame\nprint(df)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what the code does:\n\n- The `apply` method is used on the DataFrame. It applies a function along the specified axis (rows in this case).\n- `lambda row: EOQ(row['D'], row['p'], ck, ch)` creates an anonymous function that takes a row and applies the EOQ function using the 'D' and 'p' values from that row.\n- `axis=1` tells `apply` to operate along rows.\n\nThis will correctly calculate the EOQ for each row and add it as a new column 'Q' in the DataFrame."
