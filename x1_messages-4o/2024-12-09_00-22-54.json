Currently, I am running a `for` loop to process these images one by one as shown below:\n\n```python\nfor name in data_inputs:\n    sci=fits.open(name+'.fits')\n    #image is manipulated\n```\n\nThis method works but it takes a few seconds to process each image due to it processing one image at a time. Since there is no requirement to modify an image before any other, I am interested in using all 4 cores of my machine to process different images simultaneously. I have heard about the `multiprocessing` module in Python but I am unsure how to implement it in this case. Could you provide guidance on how to make use of multiprocessing to speed up the image processing task?"

        "content": "Certainly! To leverage all four cores of your machine and process the images in parallel, you can use Python's `multiprocessing` module. This module allows you to create separate processes that can execute concurrently. Here's an example of how you can apply multiprocessing to your image processing task:\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\nfrom astropy.io import fits\n\ndef process_image(name):\n    # Open and process the image\n    sci = fits.open(name + '.fits')\n    # Perform your image manipulation here\n    # Example: sci[0].data = some_processing_function(sci[0].data)\n    # Don't forget to close the file after processing\n    sci.close()\n\ndef main(data_inputs):\n    # Create a pool of workers equal to the number of cores\n    num_cores = multiprocessing.cpu_count()\n    \n    # Initialize the pool\n    with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=num_cores) as pool:\n        # Map the process_image function to the data_inputs list\n        pool.map(process_image, data_inputs)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    data_inputs = ['image1', 'image2', 'image3', ...]  # Replace with your list of image names\n    main(data_inputs)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`process_image` Function**: This function is where you define the processing logic for each image. It takes a single image name, opens the corresponding FITS file, processes it, and then closes the file.\n\n2. **`main` Function**: This function sets up the multiprocessing:\n   - It first determines the number of available CPU cores using `multiprocessing.cpu_count()`.\n   - Then, it creates a pool of worker processes with `multiprocessing.Pool`.\n   - The `pool.map` method is used to distribute the image processing tasks across the pool of workers. It applies the `process_image` function to each element in the `data_inputs` list.\n\n3. **`if __name__ == \"__main__\":`**: This ensures that the multiprocessing code only runs when the script is executed directly, which is necessary for compatibility on Windows.\n\nBy using this approach, you can process multiple images simultaneously, utilizing all available CPU cores to speed up the task. Make sure to include necessary error handling and any specific processing steps you need in the `process_image` function."
