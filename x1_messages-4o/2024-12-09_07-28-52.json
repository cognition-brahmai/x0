Look for the \"Templates\" section at the top of this list.\n   - Click on \"Python\" under \"Templates\".\n\n2. **Set the Default Working Directory**:\n   - In the template configuration for Python, you can specify the \"Working directory\".\n   - Enter the path of your desired project-wide fixed folder in the \"Working directory\" field. This will be the default working directory for all new Python run configurations.\n   - (Optional) If you want existing configurations to also use this working directory, you might need to update them manually or recreate them using this template.\n\n3. **Save the Configuration**:\n   - After setting the working directory, click \"OK\" or \"Apply\" to save the changes.\n\nBy setting the working directory in the template, all new Python configurations will default to using this directory, streamlining your workflow for your project. Existing configurations may need to be updated manually if they were created before this change."
