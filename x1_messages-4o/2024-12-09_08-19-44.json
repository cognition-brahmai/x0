I understand that cross validation can be parallelized via the 'n_jobs' parameter, but if I am not using cross validation, how can I utilize my available cores to expedite the model fitting process?"

        "content": "When using scikit-learn's Gradient Boosting models, you can parallelize the training process using the `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` or `HistGradientBoostingRegressor` from scikit-learn, which support parallelization natively. These models are generally faster and support the `n_jobs` parameter to specify the number of jobs (or CPU cores) to use during training.\n\nHere's how you can parallelize the fitting process using `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` or `HistGradientBoostingRegressor`:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.experimental import enable_hist_gradient_boosting  # noqa\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import HistGradientBoostingClassifier\n\n# Create a HistGradientBoostingClassifier model\nmodel = HistGradientBoostingClassifier(n_jobs=-1)  # Use all available cores\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n```\n\nIn the above example, setting `n_jobs=-1` will utilize all available CPU cores to parallelize the fitting process. You can also specify a specific number of cores if you don't want to use all of them by setting `n_jobs` to that number.\n\nIt's important to note that using more cores may not always result in a linear speedup due to overhead and other factors, but it can significantly reduce training time, especially for large datasets.\n\nIf you're using the classic `GradientBoostingClassifier` or `GradientBoostingRegressor`, these do not support parallelization of the fitting process itself (only cross-validation or hyperparameter tuning can be parallelized with these models), so it is recommended to switch to the histogram-based gradient boosting models for better performance with parallelization."
