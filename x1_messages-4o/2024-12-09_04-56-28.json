However, the predictions are not coming out as expected. My results are completely wrong. For instance, for the input pair (0,0), I am getting a result of 0.246135 but expecting close to 0. For the input pair (1,1), I am getting a result of 0.240923 but expecting close to 1. My training data is as follows:\n\n```swift\nlet traningData: [[Float]] = [ [0,0], [0,1], [1,0], [1,1] ]\n\nlet traningResults: [[Float]] = [ [0], [0], [0], [1] ]\n\nlet backProb = BackpropNeuralNetwork(inputSize: 2, hiddenSize: 3, outputSize: 1)\n\nfor iterations in 0..<NeuralNetConstants.iterations {\n\n    for i in 0..<traningResults.count {\n        backProb.train(input: traningData[i], targetOutput: traningResults[i], learningRate: NeuralNetConstants.learningRate, momentum: NeuralNetConstants.momentum)\n    }\n\n    for i in 0..<traningResults.count {\n        var t = traningData[i]\n        print(\"\\(t[0]), \\(t[1])  -- \\(backProb.run(input: t)[0])\")\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\nMy entire neural network code can be found in the initial post.

        "content": "Certainly! Implementing a neural network with backpropagation can be tricky, especially when debugging the logic and learning process. Let's go through some potential issues and debugging steps you can consider to improve your neural network's performance on the AND logical operator.\n\n1. **Initialization of Weights**: Ensure that your weights are initialized randomly but not too large. Using a small range (e.g., between -0.5 and 0.5) can help. Large initial weights might cause the network to saturate the activation function, leading to poor learning.\n\n2. **Activation Function**: Make sure you are using an appropriate activation function for the hidden layer and output layer. A common choice is the sigmoid function for both layers, especially for binary classification tasks like AND logic.\n\n3. **Learning Rate**: Verify that your learning rate is not too high or too low. If it's too high, the network might overshoot the optimal weights; if it's too low, learning can be very slow. Experiment with different values to find a suitable learning rate.\n\n4. **Momentum**: If you're using momentum, ensure it's set to a reasonable value, typically between 0.5 and 0.9. This helps in accelerating the learning process and avoiding local minima.\n\n5. **Number of Iterations**: Make sure that the number of iterations is sufficient for the network to converge. Sometimes, the network needs more iterations to adjust the weights properly.\n\n6. **Network Architecture**: For a simple AND operation, a single hidden layer with a few neurons should suffice. You've used 3 neurons in the hidden layer, which should be adequate, but you can try experimenting with different numbers.\n\n7. **Data Normalization**: Ensure that your input data is normalized if necessary, although for binary inputs like AND, this is less of a concern.\n\n8. **Debugging Step-by-Step**:\n   - Print the weights and biases at each iteration to see if they are updating.\n   - Check the gradients computed during backpropagation to ensure they are reasonable.\n   - Verify the outputs from each layer during the forward pass.\n\nHere's a basic checkup you can perform:\n\n```swift\n// Example sigmoid function and its derivative\nfunc sigmoid(_ x: Float) -> Float {\n    return 1.0 / (1.0 + exp(-x))\n}\n\nfunc sigmoidDerivative(_ x: Float) -> Float {\n    return x * (1.0 - x)\n}\n\n// Check weight updates\nprint(\"Initial weights: \\(backProb.weights)\")\nfor iterations in 0..<NeuralNetConstants.iterations {\n    for i in 0..<traningResults.count {\n        backProb.train(input: traningData[i], targetOutput: traningResults[i], learningRate: NeuralNetConstants.learningRate, momentum: NeuralNetConstants.momentum)\n    }\n    if iterations % 100 == 0 {  // Print every 100 iterations\n        print(\"Iteration \\(iterations): Weights: \\(backProb.weights)\")\n    }\n}\n\n// Check final outputs\nfor i in 0..<traningResults.count {\n    let t = traningData[i]\n    print(\"Input: \\(t) -- Predicted: \\(backProb.run(input: t)[0]) -- Expected: \\(traningResults[i][0])\")\n}\n```\n\nBy going through these steps, you should be able to identify where the issue might be occurring in your neural network implementation. If there's still an issue, consider breaking down the problem further, perhaps by manually computing the steps for a single iteration to track where things might be going wrong."
