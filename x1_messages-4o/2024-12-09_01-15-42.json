        "content": "To make ANSI escape codes work on Windows, you'll need to enable support for them in the command prompt or terminal. This can be achieved using the `colorama` library, which provides a simple way to make your code's ANSI escape codes work on Windows. Here's how you can modify your code to include `colorama`:\n\n1. Install the `colorama` library if you haven't already. You can do this via pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install colorama\n   ```\n\n2. Modify your Python code to use `colorama` for handling ANSI codes on Windows:\n\n```python\nimport colorama\nfrom colorama import Fore, Style\n\n# Initialize colorama\ncolorama.init()\n\n# Define your styles\nstart = Fore.RED + Style.BRIGHT\nend = Style.RESET_ALL\n\n# Print with ANSI escape codes\nprint(\"File is: \" + start + \"<placeholder>\" + end)\n\n# Deinitialize colorama if necessary (optional, mainly for certain environments)\ncolorama.deinit()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **colorama.init()**: This function initializes colorama, which makes it possible for ANSI escape codes to be interpreted correctly on Windows.\n  \n- **Fore and Style**: These are modules provided by `colorama` to define different text colors and styles. `Fore.RED` sets the text color to red, and `Style.BRIGHT` makes the text bold. `Style.RESET_ALL` resets the style back to default.\n\nWith these changes, your code should work both on Linux and Windows, displaying the text in red as intended."
