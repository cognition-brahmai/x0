I'm currently using os.system('scp \"%s\" \"%s:%s\"' % (localfile, remotehost, remotefile)), but this seems hacky, only works on Linux-like systems, and requires the Pexpect module to avoid password prompts, unless passwordless SSH is already set up for the remote host. I'm aware of modules like Twisted's conch and paramiko, but I'm not interested in implementing scp myself with low-level ssh modules, and paramiko doesn't support SCP. Additionally, the system I'm connecting to is a router that supports SSH/SCP, but not SFTP. Ideally, I'm looking for a Python module that would allow me to use code similar to:\n\n<pre><code>import scp\n\nclient = scp.Client(host=host, user=user, keyfile=keyfile)\n# or\nclient = scp.Client(host=host, user=user)\nclient.use_system_keys()\n# or\nclient = scp.Client(host=host, user=user, password=password)\n\n# and then\nclient.transfer('/etc/local/filename', '/etc/remote/filename')\n</code></pre>\n\nIs there any Python SCP solution that can handle this scenario?"

        "content": "For your requirements, using a Python module that wraps around SCP functionality without needing to implement it yourself at a low level is a great approach. While Paramiko itself doesn't directly support SCP, there is a library called `scp` that builds on top of Paramiko to provide SCP functionality. This library should fit your needs well, as it offers a simple interface for transferring files using SCP.\n\nHere's how you can use the `scp` module in combination with Paramiko to transfer files:\n\n1. First, you need to install both Paramiko and scp. You can do this using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install paramiko scp\n   ```\n\n2. Once installed, you can use the following code to transfer a file using SCP:\n\n   ```python\n   import paramiko\n   from scp import SCPClient\n\n   def create_ssh_client(host, port, user, password=None, keyfile=None):\n       client = paramiko.SSHClient()\n       client.load_system_host_keys()\n       client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())\n       if keyfile:\n           client.connect(host, port=port, username=user, key_filename=keyfile)\n       else:\n           client.connect(host, port=port, username=user, password=password)\n       return client\n\n   host = 'your_remote_host'\n   user = 'your_username'\n   password = 'your_password'  # Or use keyfile='path_to_keyfile' for key-based auth\n   localfile = '/path/to/local/file'\n   remotefile = '/path/to/remote/file'\n\n   ssh_client = create_ssh_client(host, 22, user, password=password)\n   with SCPClient(ssh_client.get_transport()) as scp:\n       scp.put(localfile, remotepath=remotefile)\n   ```\n\nThis script creates an SSH client using Paramiko, then uses the SCPClient from the `scp` module to transfer the file. You can adjust the connection method by using a password or a keyfile, depending on your setup.\n\nThis approach is cross-platform and doesn't require any system calls, making it more robust and Pythonic compared to using `os.system` with an SCP command."
