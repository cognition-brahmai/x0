In the standard Jupyter notebooks, line numbers can be added by pressing the 'L' key after selecting a cell, and all subsequent cells for that notebook will automatically have line numbers. This functionality seems to be missing in VSCode."

        "content": "To automatically enable line numbering for all cells in a Jupyter notebook in Visual Studio Code (VSCode), you can make use of the custom CSS feature or configuration settings to achieve this functionality. Unfortunately, as of my last update, VSCode does not provide a direct built-in feature to enable line numbers for all cells by default in Jupyter notebooks. However, you can try the following workaround:\n\n### Using VSCode Settings\n\n1. **Open Settings:**\n   - Go to `File` > `Preferences` > `Settings` or press `Ctrl + ,` to open the settings.\n\n2. **Search for Notebook Settings:**\n   - In the search bar, type \"Jupyter\" to filter the settings related to Jupyter.\n\n3. **Edit JSON Configuration:**\n   - Click on the top-right icon `{}` to open the settings in JSON format.\n   - Add or modify the following settings:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"jupyter.lineNumbers\": \"on\"\n     }\n     ```\n   - This setting might not be available depending on the version of VSCode or the Jupyter extension you are using.\n\n### Using Custom CSS\n\n1. **Install Custom CSS and JS Loader Extension:**\n   - To modify the appearance of VSCode, you may need an extension that allows custom CSS. Search for and install an extension like \"Custom CSS and JS Loader\" from the Extensions Marketplace.\n\n2. **Add Custom CSS:**\n   - Create a CSS file, e.g., `custom.css`, and add the following CSS rule to enable line numbers for all cells:\n     ```css\n     .CodeMirror-gutters {\n       display: block !important;\n     }\n     ```\n   - Set your VSCode to load this custom CSS file.\n\n3. **Enable and Reload:**\n   - After setting up your custom CSS file, reload VSCode to see the changes.\n\n### Note:\n- These methods might require adjustments based on updates to VSCode or its extensions.\n- Always ensure that any extension you use is from a trusted source to avoid security issues.\n\nThese steps should help you achieve automatic line numbering in VSCode Jupyter notebooks. Keep an eye on updates to the Jupyter extension in VSCode as this feature might be natively supported in future releases."
