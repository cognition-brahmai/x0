        "content": "I'm working with two QComboBoxes in PyQt/PySide where one populates the other based on the selected item. I'm experiencing a problem where, using `addItem`, it functions well for new items, but if I select another option from the first combobox, the new items do get added, but the previous items disappear and I'm left with blank items below the new ones. I tried clearing the contents of the second combobox each time a new option is selected from the first combobox by using `clear()` but it didn't solve the problem. Here's the code I used:\n\n```\nself.comboBox_2.clear()\nfor index,i in enumerate(list1):\n  self.comboBox_2.addItem(_fromUtf8(\"\"))\n  self.comboBox_2.setItemText(index+2, QApplication.translate(\"Dialog\", i, None, QApplication.UnicodeUTF8))\n```\n\nThis is part of a function that executes when the first `combobox` changes. How can I solve this issue?"

        "content": "It looks like the issue you're experiencing is due to the way you're setting the text for the items in the second QComboBox. Specifically, you're adding items with an empty string and then attempting to set the text for those items at an offset of `index+2`, which might be causing the blank items because you are skipping the first two indices.\n\nHere's a more straightforward approach to populate your second QComboBox when an item is selected in the first QComboBox:\n\n```python\nself.comboBox_2.clear()  # Clear existing items\nfor i in list1:\n    self.comboBox_2.addItem(QApplication.translate(\"Dialog\", i, None, QApplication.UnicodeUTF8))\n```\n\nThis code snippet clears the second QComboBox and then adds each item from `list1` directly without setting them manually at a specific index. This should ensure that all items are added correctly and there are no blank entries.\n\nMake sure that `list1` contains the correct items you want to display in `comboBox_2`. Additionally, if `list1` is changing based on the selection in `comboBox_1`, ensure that the logic which updates `list1` is correct.\n\nIf `list1` is dependent on the selection from the first QComboBox, ensure that the correct list is being passed to the loop. Here is how you might structure the slot function connected to the first QComboBox's `currentIndexChanged` signal:\n\n```python\ndef update_comboBox_2(self, index):\n    # Assume you have a mapping from the first combobox's items to lists\n    mapping = {\n        0: [\"Option 1A\", \"Option 1B\", \"Option 1C\"],\n        1: [\"Option 2A\", \"Option 2B\", \"Option 2C\"],\n        # Add more mappings as necessary\n    }\n\n    list1 = mapping.get(index, [])  # Get the list based on the index\n    self.comboBox_2.clear()\n    for item in list1:\n        self.comboBox_2.addItem(QApplication.translate(\"Dialog\", item, None, QApplication.UnicodeUTF8))\n\n# Connect this function to the first QComboBox's signal\nself.comboBox_1.currentIndexChanged.connect(self.update_comboBox_2)\n```\n\nThis way, each time the user selects a different item in `comboBox_1`, the correct set of items will be displayed in `comboBox_2`."
