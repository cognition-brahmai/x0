        "content": "Yes, you can condense an `if`/`else` statement into a single line in Python using conditional expressions, also known as the ternary operator. The syntax for a one-liner conditional expression is:\n\n```python\nvalue_if_true if condition else value_if_false\n```\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n```python\nx = 10\nresult = \"greater than 5\" if x > 5 else \"5 or less\"\nprint(result)\n```\n\nIn this example, `result` will be assigned the string `\"greater than 5\"` because the condition `x > 5` is true. If it were false, `result` would be assigned `\"5 or less\"`.\n\nThis syntax is useful for simple conditions where readability is not compromised by the compact form."
