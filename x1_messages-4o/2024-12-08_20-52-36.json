The algorithm should be implemented using a combination of quicksort and mergesort. The code should be written in Python 3 and should be optimized for time complexity. The algorithm should be able to handle lists with up to 1 million integers."

        "content": "To tackle the problem of sorting a list of integers such that the first half is sorted in ascending order and the second half in descending order, we can use a combination of quicksort and mergesort. We'll first sort the entire list in ascending order using quicksort, and then take the sorted list to split it into two halves. The first half will remain in ascending order, while the second half will be reversed to achieve descending order.\n\nHere is a Python implementation of the described algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef quicksort(arr):\n    \"\"\"Sorts the array in ascending order using quicksort algorithm.\"\"\"\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]\n    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]\n    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]\n    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]\n    return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)\n\ndef sort_special(arr):\n    \"\"\"Sorts the list such that the first half is in ascending order and the second half in descending order.\"\"\"\n    n = len(arr)\n    sorted_arr = quicksort(arr)\n    \n    # Determine the split point\n    midpoint = n // 2\n    \n    # Split and reverse the second half\n    first_half = sorted_arr[:midpoint]\n    second_half = sorted_arr[midpoint:]\n    second_half.reverse()\n    \n    # Combine the two halves\n    return first_half + second_half\n\n# Example usage:\nimport random\n\n# Generate a list of 1 million integers with duplicates and negatives\ntest_input = [random.randint(-1000, 1000) for _ in range(1000000)]\n\n# Sort the list using the special sorting function\nsorted_output = sort_special(test_input)\n\n# Verify the output\nprint(sorted_output[:10])  # Print the first 10 elements (ascending)\nprint(sorted_output[-10:]) # Print the last 10 elements (descending)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Quicksort**: We implement a standard quicksort algorithm that sorts the array in ascending order. This handles duplicates and negative numbers naturally.\n\n2. **Splitting the List**: After sorting, the list is split into two halves. The midpoint is determined by integer division of the length of the list.\n\n3. **Reversing the Second Half**: The second half of the sorted list is reversed to achieve the desired descending order.\n\n4. **Combining the Halves**: Finally, the two parts are concatenated to form the final list as required.\n\nThis algorithm is efficient for handling lists with up to 1 million integers due to the efficiency of quicksort, which has an average time complexity of \\(O(n \\log n)\\). The reversal operation is \\(O(n)\\), making the combined approach suitable for large datasets."
