        "content": "To create a Java class that takes in two numbers, calculates their sum, and prints the result to the console, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create a Java Class**: Start by creating a new Java file named `SumCalculator.java`.\n\n2. **Define the Class and Main Method**: Declare the class and its `main` method, which is the entry point of the program.\n\n3. **Read Input**: You can use the `Scanner` class to read input from the console.\n\n4. **Perform the Calculation**: Calculate the sum of the two numbers.\n\n5. **Print the Result**: Output the result to the console.\n\nHere is a simple implementation:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class SumCalculator {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Create a Scanner object to read input\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        // Prompt the user to enter the first number\n        System.out.print(\"Enter the first number: \");\n        double firstNumber = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        // Prompt the user to enter the second number\n        System.out.print(\"Enter the second number: \");\n        double secondNumber = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        // Calculate the sum of the two numbers\n        double sum = firstNumber + secondNumber;\n\n        // Print the result\n        System.out.println(\"The sum of \" + firstNumber + \" and \" + secondNumber + \" is: \" + sum);\n\n        // Close the scanner\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Import Statement**: `import java.util.Scanner;` imports the `Scanner` class, which is used to read input from the console.\n- **Scanner Object**: `Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);` creates a `Scanner` object to read input from the standard input stream.\n- **Reading Input**: `scanner.nextDouble();` reads a double value from the user.\n- **Calculating the Sum**: `double sum = firstNumber + secondNumber;` calculates the sum of the two numbers.\n- **Printing the Result**: `System.out.println(...);` prints the result to the console.\n- **Closing the Scanner**: `scanner.close();` closes the scanner to free up resources.\n\nYou can compile and run this program using a Java compiler to see it in action."
