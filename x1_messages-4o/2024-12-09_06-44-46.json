I want to create a ForeignKey relationship where 'Game' has a ForeignKey to 'Member' indicating which member's turn it is and each 'Member' has a ForeignKey to 'Game' indicating which game they are playing. However, Django does not allow me to reference a class before it has been declared and I can't declare them simultaneously. Here is my code:\n\n```python\nclass Game(models.Model):\n    title = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n    summery = models.CharField(max_length=500)\n    key = models.IntegerField()\n    pin = models.CharField(max_length=12)\n    complete = models.BooleanField()\n    invite_sent = models.DateTimeField()\n    on = models.ForeignKey('Member', blank = True) #<----\n\nclass Member(models.Model):\n    email = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    color = models.CharField(max_length=11)\n    game = models.ForeignKey(Game) #<----\n```\nAs an example, if there were five members playing one game, all five would have foreign keys to the game. The game on the other hand would have one foreign key to the particular member whose turn it was. How can I create this relationship between 'Game' and 'Member' models?"

        "content": "To establish a ForeignKey relationship between the `Game` and `Member` models, where each `Member` is associated with a `Game` and a `Game` keeps track of whose turn it is, you can use Django's string reference for the ForeignKey fields. This approach allows you to reference models that are defined later in the code. Additionally, you should ensure that you provide a related name for better access to related objects.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass Game(models.Model):\n    title = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n    summary = models.CharField(max_length=500)\n    key = models.IntegerField()\n    pin = models.CharField(max_length=12)\n    complete = models.BooleanField()\n    invite_sent = models.DateTimeField()\n    on = models.ForeignKey(\n        'Member', \n        blank=True, \n        null=True, \n        on_delete=models.SET_NULL, \n        related_name='games_as_current_turn'\n    )\n\nclass Member(models.Model):\n    email = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    color = models.CharField(max_length=11)\n    game = models.ForeignKey(\n        Game, \n        on_delete=models.CASCADE, \n        related_name='members'\n    )\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **String Reference**: In the `Game` model's `on` field, you are using a string reference `'Member'`. This allows Django to resolve the reference later.\n\n2. **Null and Blank**: Set `blank=True` and `null=True` for the `on` field in the `Game` model. This way, it is optional to have a member set as the current turn.\n\n3. **Related Names**: Use `related_name` to create a reverse relationship. For example, in the `Member` model, `related_name='members'` allows you to access all members in a game using `game.members.all()`. Similarly, for the `on` field in `Game`, `related_name='games_as_current_turn'` allows you to access games where the member is currently taking a turn.\n\n4. **on_delete**: Use `on_delete=models.SET_NULL` for the `on` field to prevent deletion of a `Member` from also deleting the `Game`. You can use `on_delete=models.CASCADE` for the `game` field in `Member` to delete members when the game is deleted.\n\nThis setup should help you manage the relationships between `Game` and `Member` effectively."
