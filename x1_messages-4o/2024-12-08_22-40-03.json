Assuming you have a database connection and the necessary toolbox, here's a simple example of how you might structure the query:\n\n```matlab\n% Establish a database connection\nconn = database('YourDatabaseName', 'username', 'password');\n\n% Define the SQL query\nsqlquery = [\n    \"SELECT * FROM restaurants \" + ...\n    \"WHERE cuisine_rating >= 4 AND price_level = 'expensive'\"\n];\n\n% Execute the query and fetch the data\ndata = fetch(conn, sqlquery);\n\n% Close the database connection\nclose(conn);\n\n% Display the results\ndisp(data);\n```\n\nIn this example, replace `'YourDatabaseName'`, `'username'`, and `'password'` with your actual database credentials. The table `restaurants` and the fields `cuisine_rating` and `price_level` should be adjusted according to your database schema. This code assumes that `price_level` is a categorical variable with a value such as `'expensive'`. Adjust these variables and the query logic to fit the structure of your database."
