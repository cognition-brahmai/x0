This makes the code more readable as we can apply methods directly on an instance of a class. I am looking for something similar in Python. Instead of writing code like this:\n\n```python\nx = SomeClass()\ndiv = x.getMyDiv()\nspan = x.FirstChild(x.FirstChild(div)) \n```\n\nI'd like to write:\n\n```python\nspan = div.FirstChild().FirstChild() \n```\n\nCan Python provide a similar functionality?"

        "content": "Yes, Python can achieve similar functionality using a combination of method chaining and returning the instance itself to facilitate the chaining. Although Python doesn't have \"extension methods\" like C#, you can design your classes in a way that supports a fluent interface, which allows method chaining.\n\nHere's how you can implement this concept in Python:\n\n```python\nclass SomeClass:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize your class attributes\n        pass\n\n    def getMyDiv(self):\n        # Implementation of getMyDiv\n        return self\n\n    def FirstChild(self):\n        # Implementation of FirstChild\n        # Perform some operation and then return self to allow chaining\n        return self\n\n# Usage\nx = SomeClass()\ndiv = x.getMyDiv()\nspan = div.FirstChild().FirstChild()\n```\n\nIn this example, the `FirstChild` method returns `self`, allowing you to chain another `FirstChild` call directly on the result. This way, you can achieve a more readable and concise code similar to method chaining in languages like C#. \n\nEnsure that each method you want to be chainable returns `self` or another instance that supports further chaining. This pattern is commonly used in Python to create a fluent interface."
