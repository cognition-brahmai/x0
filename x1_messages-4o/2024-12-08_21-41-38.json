The farmer wants to sort all the apples, but doesn't want to overload the robot. The apples weigh as follows: 2 oz, 4 oz, 6 oz, 8 oz, 10 oz, 12 oz, 14 oz, 16 oz, 18 oz, 20 oz. What is the minimum number of times the robot needs to be used to sort all the apples?"

The apples given are: 2 oz, 4 oz, 6 oz, 8 oz, 10 oz, 12 oz, 14 oz, 16 oz, 18 oz, and 20 oz. There are a total of 10 apples.\n\nSince the robot can handle up to 5 apples at a time, and there are 10 apples in total, we can divide the apples into two groups of 5 apples each. The robot will need to handle each group separately.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of times the robot needs to be used to sort all the apples is 2."
