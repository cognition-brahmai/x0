I know adding extension methods to a defined type can be done easily, like in the following example:\n\n```python\nclass myClass:\n    pass\n\nmyClass.myExtensionMethod = lambda self,x:x * 2\nz = myClass()\nprint z.myExtensionMethod(10)\n```\nBut, how can I add extension methods to Python's built-in types such as list or dict?\n\n```python\nlist.myExtension = lambda self,x:x * 2\nlist.myExtension(10)\n```"

        "content": "In Python, you can indeed add methods to built-in types like `list` or `dict`, but it's generally not recommended because it can lead to unexpected behavior in your code or in third-party libraries that rely on the default behavior of these types. However, for educational purposes or in controlled environments, it can be done.\n\nHere's how you can add a method to a built-in type like `list`:\n\n```python\n# Define the extension method\ndef my_extension_method(self, x):\n    return [item * x for item in self]\n\n# Add the method to the list class\nlist.my_extension = my_extension_method\n\n# Create a list and use the new method\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3]\nprint(my_list.my_extension(2))  # Output: [2, 4, 6]\n```\n\nIn this example, `my_extension_method` is defined to multiply each element in the list by `x`, and then added to the `list` class as `my_extension`. You can then use this method on any list instance.\n\nAgain, be cautious when modifying built-in types since it can affect all instances of that type throughout your program. It's usually better to subclass a built-in type or use utility functions if you need to extend functionality."
