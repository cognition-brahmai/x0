I have set these environment variables using `/etc/environment`. For example, when I echo `$SECRET_KEY` in the terminal, I get `xxx-xxx-xxxx`. However, when I try to access the same key in Python using `from os import environ` and `environ[\"SECRET_KEY\"]`, I'm getting a KeyError. I had to run `source /etc/environment` to get bash to see them, which I thought was odd. Also, when I tried to use `printenv SECRET_KEY`, it produced nothing, leading me to believe that `SECRET_KEY` is a shell, not an environment variable. Why can't Python access these environment variables?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering stems from the way environment variables are set and accessed in different contexts. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Environment Variables in Bash**: When you set environment variables in `/etc/environment`, they are supposed to be available system-wide. However, they will only be loaded into the environment of a process if that process or its parent process reads and exports them. Typically, this happens during the shell's startup process.\n\n2. **Sourcing `/etc/environment`**: By running `source /etc/environment`, you're manually reading and exporting the variables into your current shell session. This makes them available to processes launched from that shell, including Python scripts.\n\n3. **`printenv` vs. Shell Variables**: The `printenv` command shows only exported environment variables. If `SECRET_KEY` is not shown, it's likely that it's not being exported, or it's only set as a shell variable rather than an environment variable.\n\n4. **Python and Environment Variables**: When you run a Python script, it inherits the environment of the shell or process that started it. If `SECRET_KEY` isn't visible to `printenv`, it won't be visible to Python either.\n\nTo solve this issue:\n\n- **Ensure Variables are Exported**: Edit your shell's configuration files (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`) to export the variables. For example:\n\n  ```bash\n  export SECRET_KEY=xxx-xxx-xxxx\n  ```\n\n- **Restart Your Shell**: After editing these files, either restart your terminal session or run `source ~/.bashrc` (or the appropriate configuration file) to apply the changes.\n\n- **Check Process Hierarchy**: Ensure that the Python process is launched from a shell that has these variables correctly exported.\n\n- **Use a Wrapper Script**: If necessary, create a shell script that sets the environment variables and then runs your Python script, ensuring the Python process inherits the necessary environment:\n\n  ```bash\n  #!/bin/bash\n  source /etc/environment\n  python your_script.py\n  ```\n\nBy ensuring the environment variables are exported and inherited correctly, you should be able to access them from Python without encountering a `KeyError`."
