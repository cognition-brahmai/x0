        "content": "To achieve this task, you'll need to modify your program to handle the output of probability scores from a sentiment analysis model. Below is a general outline of how you can implement this using a typical machine learning framework, assuming you have a pre-trained sentiment analysis model. I'll describe the process and provide an example code snippet in Python to help you get started.\n\n### Steps to Implement:\n\n1. **Load the Pre-trained Model**: Ensure that your model is capable of providing probability scores for each sentiment category.\n\n2. **Predict Sentiment**: Use your model to predict the sentiment, which should also return probability scores for each category.\n\n3. **Format the Output**: Present the results in a table with three columns: Sentiment Category, Probability Score, and Explanation.\n\n4. **Provide Explanation**: Add a brief explanation for each sentiment category based on the probability score.\n\n### Example Code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assume this is a pre-trained sentiment analysis model\nclass SentimentModel:\n    def predict_proba(self, text):\n        # Dummy probabilities for demonstration\n        return np.array([0.1, 0.7, 0.2])  # [negative, positive, neutral]\n\ndef get_explanation(probability, category):\n    if category == \"positive\":\n        return \"The text likely expresses positive sentiment.\"\n    elif category == \"negative\":\n        return \"The text likely expresses negative sentiment.\"\n    elif category == \"neutral\":\n        return \"The text likely expresses neutral sentiment.\"\n    return \"\"\n\ndef analyze_sentiment(text):\n    # Load your model (dummy example here)\n    model = SentimentModel()\n    \n    # Get probability scores\n    probabilities = model.predict_proba(text)\n    \n    # Define sentiment categories\n    categories = ['negative', 'positive', 'neutral']\n    \n    # Prepare data for the output table\n    data = []\n    for category, prob in zip(categories, probabilities):\n        explanation = get_explanation(prob, category)\n        data.append([category, prob, explanation])\n    \n    # Create a DataFrame for a neat table output\n    df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['Sentiment Category', 'Probability Score', 'Explanation'])\n    return df\n\n# Example usage\ntext = \"The product is great and I love using it!\"\nresult_df = analyze_sentiment(text)\nprint(result_df)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n\n- **SentimentModel Class**: A placeholder for your actual sentiment analysis model. The `predict_proba` method should return an array of probability scores corresponding to each sentiment category.\n\n- **get_explanation Function**: Provides a simple explanation based on the sentiment category and its probability score.\n\n- **analyze_sentiment Function**: Calls the model to obtain probability scores and formats them into a pandas DataFrame for easy reading.\n\n- **Output Table**: The table displays the sentiment category, its associated probability score, and an explanation.\n\nThis example uses dummy data, so you need to replace the `SentimentModel` class with your actual model and adjust the `predict_proba` method accordingly. Make sure your model can output probability scores for each sentiment category."
