Here's how you can do it for Windows, Linux, and macOS:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport platform\nimport subprocess\n\ndef open_folder(path):\n    if platform.system() == \"Windows\":\n        os.startfile(path)\n    elif platform.system() == \"Darwin\":  # macOS\n        subprocess.run([\"open\", path])\n    elif platform.system() == \"Linux\":\n        try:\n            subprocess.run([\"xdg-open\", path])\n        except FileNotFoundError:\n            try:\n                subprocess.run([\"nautilus\", path])\n            except FileNotFoundError:\n                print(\"No suitable file manager found.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Unsupported OS.\")\n\n# Example usage\nfolder_path = \"/path/to/your/folder\"\nopen_folder(folder_path)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Windows**: `os.startfile(path)` is used to open the folder in File Explorer.\n- **macOS**: `subprocess.run([\"open\", path])` opens the folder in Finder.\n- **Linux**: The script attempts to use `xdg-open`, which is a desktop-independent tool that opens a file or URL in the user's preferred application. If `xdg-open` is not available, the script tries `nautilus`, which is specific to GNOME desktop environments.\n\n### Note:\n- You may need to adjust the path variable to point to the folder you want to open.\n- Ensure that the `path` is valid and correctly formatted for your operating system.\n- This script might require proper permissions to execute on certain systems due to security policies."
