However, I'm wondering, is there a good use-case for this syntax? If everyone who encounters it makes the same mistake, debugs it, understands the issue and from then on tries to avoid it, what use is there for such syntax?"

        "content": "The behavior you're describing is often considered a trap for beginners in Python due to the mutable default argument, but it can be useful in certain situations where you intentionally want to maintain state across function calls. Here are a couple of scenarios where this behavior can be beneficial:\n\n1. **Memoization**: You can use a mutable default argument to store previously computed results in a function, effectively creating a simple memoization mechanism. This can optimize performance by avoiding redundant calculations.\n\n   ```python\n   def fibonacci(n, _cache={0: 0, 1: 1}):\n       if n not in _cache:\n           _cache[n] = fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)\n       return _cache[n]\n\n   print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55\n   ```\n\n2. **Persistent State**: If you have a function that needs to maintain state across invocations, a mutable default argument can serve as a persistent storage to keep this state.\n\n   ```python\n   def tracker(item, _history=[]):\n       _history.append(item)\n       return _history\n\n   print(tracker('start'))  # Output: ['start']\n   print(tracker('continue'))  # Output: ['start', 'continue']\n   print(tracker('end'))  # Output: ['start', 'continue', 'end']\n   ```\n\n3. **Shared Resources**: If multiple function calls need to share and update a resource, using a mutable default argument can facilitate this. However, this should be done carefully to ensure that the shared resource is used correctly and consistently.\n\nWhile these use cases can be valid, they require careful handling to avoid unintended side effects. In general, if the goal is not to share state across function calls, it is better to use `None` as the default value and initialize the mutable object within the function:\n\n```python\ndef good_append(new_item, a_list=None):\n    if a_list is None:\n        a_list = []\n    a_list.append(new_item)\n    return a_list\n\nprint(good_append('one'))  # Output: ['one']\nprint(good_append('two'))  # Output: ['two']\n```\n\nIt's important to clearly document the intended behavior when using mutable default arguments to avoid confusion for others who may read or maintain the code."
