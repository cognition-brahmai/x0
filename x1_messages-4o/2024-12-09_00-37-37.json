        "content": "I am in search of a comprehensive and well-developed geometrical library for Python. Some of the features I need include: the ability to evaluate intersections between two lines in 2D and 3D, the point of intersection between a plane and a line, or the line of intersection between two planes. I need to evaluate the minimum distance between a line and a point, find the orthonormal to a plane passing through a point, rotate, translate, mirror a set of points, and find the dihedral angle defined by four points. Although some of these functionalities can be found in gaming libraries, I don't want to include unnecessary features such as graphics. Could anyone suggest a suitable library?"

        "content": "For your specific needs, you might want to consider the following Python libraries that are focused on geometric computations without the overhead of graphical features:\n\n1. **SymPy**: This is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It includes a geometry module capable of handling 2D and 3D geometric entities and operations. It supports operations like intersection calculations, distance measurements, and transformations (rotation, translation, etc.). However, for more complex 3D operations, it might require additional coding.\n\n   Installation:\n   ```bash\n   pip install sympy\n   ```\n\n   Documentation: [SymPy Geometry](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/geometry/index.html)\n\n2. **Shapely**: While primarily 2D, Shapely is an excellent library for planar geometry operations. It can handle intersections, distances, and transformations in 2D. For 3D, it can be combined with other libraries.\n\n   Installation:\n   ```bash\n   pip install shapely\n   ```\n\n   Documentation: [Shapely Documentation](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/)\n\n3. **SciPy**: The spatial module in SciPy provides some functionalities for spatial data structures and algorithms, including distance computations and transformations. For more advanced geometric constructs, it might require additional coding.\n\n   Installation:\n   ```bash\n   pip install scipy\n   ```\n\n   Documentation: [SciPy Spatial](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/spatial.html)\n\n4. **CGAL (Computational Geometry Algorithms Library)**: While not directly a Python library, CGAL provides Python bindings and is an extensive library for computational geometry. It\u2019s highly efficient and robust for both 2D and 3D operations.\n\n   Installation may require building from source and setting up the Python bindings, which can be more complex than typical Python packages.\n\n   Documentation: [CGAL Python Bindings](https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/Python.html)\n\n5. **PyGeometry**: This is a lesser-known library but is designed for geometric computations. It supports many operations you might require, especially for 3D geometry.\n\n   Unfortunately, it's not as well-documented or widely used, so you might need to experiment with it to see if it meets your needs.\n\nFor your specific requirements, you might need to combine features from multiple libraries or implement some custom solutions. Make sure to check each library's documentation to ensure they meet your needs, and consider the trade-offs between ease of use and the complexity of installation or integration."
