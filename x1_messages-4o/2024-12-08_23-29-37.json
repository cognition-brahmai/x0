        "content": "To solve the problem, let's first check the condition regarding the perimeter and the sum of the length and breadth.\n\nThe perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is given by:\n\\[\nP = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{breadth})\n\\]\n\nThe sum of the length and breadth is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = \\text{length} + \\text{breadth}\n\\]\n\nGiven:\n- Length = 10 cm\n- Breadth = 4 cm\n\nLet's calculate both:\n- Perimeter: \n  \\[\n  P = 2 \\times (10 + 4) = 28 \\text{ cm}\n  \\]\n\n- Sum:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Sum} = 10 + 4 = 14 \\text{ cm}\n  \\]\n\nThe condition that the perimeter is equal to the sum of the length and breadth is not satisfied in this case since \\(28 \\neq 14\\). Therefore, this condition cannot hold true with the given dimensions.\n\nHowever, let's continue with the other calculations as requested:\n\n### Area of the Rectangle\n\nThe area \\( A \\) of a rectangle is given by:\n\\[\nA = \\text{length} \\times \\text{breadth}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\\[\nA = 10 \\times 4 = 40 \\text{ cm}^2\n\\]\n\n### Diagonal of the Rectangle\n\nThe diagonal \\( d \\) of a rectangle is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{\\text{length}^2 + \\text{breadth}^2}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{10^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{100 + 16} = \\sqrt{116}\n\\]\n\nThe value of the diagonal in centimeters is:\n\\[\nd \\approx 10.77 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\n### LaTeX Equation\n\nThe entire solution can be summarized using LaTeX as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Area, } A &= \\text{length} \\times \\text{breadth} = 10 \\times 4 = 40 \\text{ cm}^2, \\\\\n\\text{Diagonal, } d &= \\sqrt{\\text{length}^2 + \\text{breadth}^2} = \\sqrt{10^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{116} \\approx 10.77 \\text{ cm}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]"
