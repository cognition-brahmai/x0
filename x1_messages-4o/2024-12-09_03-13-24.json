I try to add docstrings to every class, method and function, but Pylint seems to be insisting that files should also have a docstring at the beginning which I want to avoid. Also, is there a term for the legal jargon often found at the beginning of a proprietary source file? Could you provide any examples?"

Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Locate the top of your Python file.\n2. Add the following comment line:\n\n   ```python\n   # pylint: disable=missing-module-docstring\n   ```\n\nThis will disable the warning for a missing module-level docstring for that specific file.\n\nRegarding the legal jargon often found at the beginning of a proprietary source file, it is commonly referred to as a \"legal header\" or \"copyright notice\". This usually includes information about the copyright holder, any licenses that apply to the file, and possibly disclaimers regarding the use of the code.\n\nHere is an example of a legal header:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nCopyright (c) 2023, Your Company Name\nAll rights reserved.\n\nThis source code is licensed under the MIT License found in the\nLICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.\n\"\"\"\n\n# pylint: disable=missing-module-docstring\n\ndef example_function():\n    pass\n```\n\nIncluding such a header is a common practice in proprietary software to clarify ownership and licensing terms."
