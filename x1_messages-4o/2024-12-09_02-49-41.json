Please rerun this cell to enable.\n```\nEven after rerunning the cell, the problem persists. Can someone help me resolve this issue?"

        "content": "It seems like you're encountering an issue with the file upload widget in Google Colab. This problem can often occur due to the execution environment not being properly initialized for the widget to appear. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Browser Compatibility**: Make sure you are using a supported browser. Google Chrome is recommended for the best compatibility with Google Colab.\n\n2. **Restart the Runtime**: Sometimes, restarting the runtime can help resolve this issue. You can do this by going to `Runtime` in the menu and selecting `Restart runtime`.\n\n3. **Clear Outputs**: Clear the outputs of the notebook to ensure that there are no residual outputs that might be causing the issue. You can do this by clicking on `Edit` -> `Clear all outputs`.\n\n4. **Re-run the Cell**: After restarting the runtime and clearing outputs, try running the cell again to see if the upload widget appears.\n\n5. **Check for Ad Blockers**: Sometimes, browser extensions such as ad blockers or privacy-focused extensions can interfere with the functioning of widgets. Try disabling them temporarily to see if it resolves the issue.\n\n6. **Use Alternative Methods**: If the issue persists, you can try using another method to upload files, such as:\n\n   - **Mount Google Drive**:\n     ```python\n     from google.colab import drive\n     drive.mount('/content/drive')\n     ```\n     You can then upload files to your Google Drive and access them from Colab.\n\n   - **Use a Direct URL**: If your file is available online, you can download it directly using `wget` or `curl`:\n     ```python\n     !wget -O filename 'http://example.com/path/to/your/file'\n     ```\n\nIf none of these solutions work, try running the notebook in an incognito window or a different browser to rule out any browser-specific issues. Let me know if you need further assistance!"
