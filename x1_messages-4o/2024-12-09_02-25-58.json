I have a multiline string as follows:\n```python\nmy_string = \"\"\"This is my first line,\nthis is my second line, and...\n...this is my fourth line!\"\"\"\n```\nI want to store the first line of this string (\"This is my first line,\") into a separate string. I tried to use .readline() method as suggested in a similar question, but I'm encountering an error: 'AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'readline''. How can I achieve this correctly?"

        "content": "To read the first line of a multiline string in Python, you can use the `splitlines()` method, which splits the string at line boundaries and returns a list of lines. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nmy_string = \"\"\"This is my first line,\nthis is my second line, and...\n...this is my fourth line!\"\"\"\n\n# Use splitlines() to split the string into lines\nlines = my_string.splitlines()\n\n# Access the first line\nfirst_line = lines[0]\n\nprint(first_line)\n```\n\nIn this code, `splitlines()` splits the `my_string` into individual lines, and then you can access the first line by indexing the resulting list with `[0]`. This will store \"This is my first line,\" into the `first_line` variable."
