Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Define the integers\nnum1 = 10\nnum2 = 20\n\n# Convert integers to strings and concatenate\nresult = str(num1) + str(num2)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)  # Output: \"1020\"\n```\n\nIn this example, both `num1` and `num2` are converted to strings using the `str()` function. Then, the two string representations are concatenated using the `+` operator. The result is a single string \"1020\"."
