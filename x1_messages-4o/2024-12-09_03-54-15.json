        "content": "To obtain the primary IP address of the localhost on Linux (Debian and RedHat) and macOS, you can use different command-line tools that are more consistent in their output compared to `ifconfig`. Here's a solution that works across these platforms:\n\n### Linux (Debian and RedHat)\n\nYou can use the `ip` command, which is part of the `iproute2` package, and is more modern and consistent than `ifconfig`:\n\n```bash\nip -4 addr show scope global | grep inet | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1 | head -n 1\n```\n\nThis command does the following:\n\n- `ip -4 addr show scope global`: Lists all IPv4 addresses with a global scope.\n- `grep inet`: Filters the lines containing the word \"inet\".\n- `awk '{print $2}'`: Extracts the second field, which is the IP address with the subnet.\n- `cut -d/ -f1`: Removes the subnet part, leaving only the IP address.\n- `head -n 1`: Takes the first IP address from the list.\n\n### macOS (OS X 10.7+)\n\nOn macOS, you can use `ifconfig` combined with `awk`:\n\n```bash\nifconfig | grep 'inet ' | grep -v 127.0.0.1 | awk '{print $2}' | head -n 1\n```\n\nThis command does the following:\n\n- `ifconfig`: Lists all network interfaces.\n- `grep 'inet '`: Filters lines containing \"inet\" (IPv4 addresses).\n- `grep -v 127.0.0.1`: Excludes the loopback address.\n- `awk '{print $2}'`: Extracts the IP address field.\n- `head -n 1`: Takes the first IP address from the list.\n\nBoth solutions will give you the primary non-loopback IP address on the respective systems. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute these commands, and remember that network configurations can vary, so you might need to adjust the commands slightly depending on your specific setup."
