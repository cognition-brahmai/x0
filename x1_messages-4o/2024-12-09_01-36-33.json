After importing Firebase libraries and running the application, I encounter a \"Duplicate class found in module\" error. The error concerns \"com.google.android.gms.internal.vision\" classes found in \"jetified-play-services-vision-20.0.0-runtime\" and \"jetified-play-services-vision-common-19.1.0-runtime\". How can I fix this dependency resolution error? Here is my dependency in build.gradle (Module: app):\n```java\napply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'\n\ndependencies {\n\n    implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.2.0'\n    implementation platform('com.google.firebase:firebase-bom:26.1.0')\n    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-analytics'\n    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-ml-vision:24.0.3'\n\n}\n```\nAnd my build.gradle (Project):\n```java\nbuildscript {\n    \n    dependencies {\n        classpath \"com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.1.1\"\n        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.4'\n\n    }\n}\n```"

        "content": "The \"Duplicate class found\" error typically arises when there are conflicting versions of a library or module being included in your project. In your case, this is happening with the Google Play services Vision libraries. To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that your dependencies do not bring in conflicting versions of the same library.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Exclude Conflicting Dependencies**: You can exclude the conflicting library from one of the dependencies. For example, you can exclude `play-services-vision-common` from `firebase-ml-vision` or vice versa.\n\n2. **Force a Specific Version**: Use the `implementation` keyword with a specific version of the library that you want to use. This can sometimes resolve conflicts by ensuring all dependencies rely on the same version.\n\nHere's a possible solution using both approaches:\n\n```java\ndependencies {\n\n    implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.2.0'\n    implementation platform('com.google.firebase:firebase-bom:26.1.0')\n    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-analytics'\n    \n    // Add Firebase ML Vision and exclude the conflicting library\n    implementation('com.google.firebase:firebase-ml-vision:24.0.3') {\n        exclude group: 'com.google.android.gms', module: 'play-services-vision-common'\n    }\n\n    // Explicitly add the vision-common dependency to ensure a compatible version\n    implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-vision-common:19.1.0'\n}\n```\n\n3. **Update Dependencies**: Check if there are newer versions of the libraries you are using that might have resolved these conflicts. You can look up the latest versions on the [Google Maven Repository](https://maven.google.com/web/index.html) or through the Firebase and Google Play services release notes.\n\n4. **Clean and Rebuild**: After making changes to your `build.gradle`, perform a clean build of your project to ensure all caches are cleared and the dependencies are correctly resolved. You can do this by selecting \"Build > Clean Project\" and then \"Build > Rebuild Project\" in Android Studio.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the \"Duplicate class found\" error and proceed with your Firebase ML Kit implementation."
