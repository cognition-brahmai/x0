I tried to use the filter function like this: L = filter(None, L), but it removes the 0 values as well, giving me [23, 234, 89, 35, 9]. I need the 0's to stay because I'm calculating percentile of the data and these values make a significant difference. How can I remove only the None values from the list without removing the 0 values?"

This approach allows you to filter out `None` while keeping all other values, including `0`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nL = [0, 23, 234, 89, None, 0, 35, 9]\nL = [x for x in L if x is not None]\n```\n\nAfter executing the above code, `L` will be `[0, 23, 234, 89, 0, 35, 9]`, with all `None` values removed and `0` values retained."
