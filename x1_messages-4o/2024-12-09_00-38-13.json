I'm encountering a DBAPIError with the message \"(pyodbc.Error) ('IM002', '[IM002] [Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Data source name not found and no default driver specified (0) (SQLDriverConnect)\". I suspect that my database connection string might be incorrect.

        "content": "The error you're encountering indicates that the ODBC driver manager cannot find a data source name (DSN) or a default driver to connect to your SQL Server. This is likely due to an incorrect or incomplete connection string in your configuration. Here's how you can fix it:\n\n1. **Install the ODBC Driver for SQL Server**: Ensure that you have the correct ODBC driver installed on your system. You can download it from Microsoft's official site. For SQL Server, the recommended driver is \"ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server\".\n\n2. **Correct the Connection String**: You need to specify the driver in your connection string. The connection string should include the driver, server, and database. Here's a corrected version:\n\n   ```python\n   app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'mssql+pyodbc://<username>:<password>@HARRISONS-THINK/LendApp?driver=ODBC+Driver+17+for+SQL+Server'\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, and `HARRISONS-THINK` with your actual SQL Server username, password, and server name. \n\n3. **Check for Case Sensitivity in Model Class**: In your `models.py`, ensure that the class name `Transaction` has the correct casing for `db.Model`:\n\n   ```python\n   class Transaction(db.Model):  # Change 'db.model' to 'db.Model'\n   ```\n\n4. **Handle SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS**: Ensure that the `SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS` setting is added to `app.config`:\n\n   ```python\n   app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify the DB Server and Firewall Settings**: Make sure that your SQL server is running and that any necessary firewall settings allow connections from your client machine.\n\n6. **Test the Connection**: After making these changes, test the connection again by running:\n\n   ```python\n   from LendApp import db\n   db.create_all()\n   ```\n\n7. **Debugging**: If you encounter further issues, check the following:\n   - Ensure your SQL Server allows TCP/IP connections.\n   - Verify that your username and password are correct.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to establish a connection to your local MSSQL database using Flask-SQLAlchemy."
