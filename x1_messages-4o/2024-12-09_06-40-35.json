Here's a suggested structure for your project that involves calculating the price of sails:\n\n### Project Structure\n\n```\nsail_pricing/\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 sailqt/                  # Main package for your application\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py          # Initialize the package\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 gui/                 # Subpackage for GUI components\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 main_window.py   # Main window layout and logic\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 components.py    # Custom widgets, if any\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 styles.py        # Styling for GUI components\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 database/            # Subpackage for database interactions\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 models.py        # ORM models or database schema\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 db_connection.py # Database connection and utilities\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 logic/               # Subpackage for business logic\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 calculation.py   # Price calculation logic\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 utils/               # Subpackage for utility functions\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 helpers.py       # Any helper functions\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 tests/                   # Test suite\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 test_gui.py\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 test_database.py\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 test_logic.py\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 requirements.txt         # Project dependencies\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md                # Project documentation\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 main.py                  # Entry point for your application\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **sailqt:** This is the main package containing all the code for your application.\n- **gui:** This subpackage handles all GUI-related code, such as creating windows, managing user interactions, and styling.\n- **database:** This subpackage is responsible for all interactions with the database, including models and connection handling. Using an ORM like SQLAlchemy can simplify interactions with the database.\n- **logic:** This contains the core business logic, such as the calculations for sail pricing. This separation helps keep your code organized and makes it easier to test.\n- **utils:** Any utility functions that are used across different parts of the application.\n- **tests:** This directory contains your test suite, ensuring your code behaves as expected.\n- **requirements.txt:** Lists all the dependencies your project needs to run, which can be installed using `pip`.\n- **README.md:** Provides documentation for your project, including how to set up and run it.\n\n### Why `import os` Works But `import sailqt` Might Not\n\nWhen you use `import os`, you're importing a module that's part of Python's standard library, which is always available. This is because the Python interpreter knows where to find it.\n\nHowever, when you try to `import sailqt`, the interpreter needs to know where your `sailqt` package is located. Here's why it might not work:\n\n1. **Module Not Found:** If `sailqt` is not in the current directory or in your Python path, Python won't be able to find it. Ensure that you're running your script from the correct directory or that `sailqt` is installed in your Python environment.\n\n2. **Package Structure:** Ensure that `sailqt` and its submodules are correctly structured with `__init__.py` files, which makes Python treat directories as packages.\n\n3. **PYTHONPATH:** You might need to adjust the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to include the directory where `sailqt` is located.\n\nBy structuring your project well and ensuring Python knows where to find your packages, you'll be able to import and use them just like you do with standard library modules."
