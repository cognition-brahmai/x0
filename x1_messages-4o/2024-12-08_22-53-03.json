Each bus has a fuel tank with a capacity of 50 gallons and can travel an average distance of 25 miles on one gallon of fuel. The city wants to reduce fuel consumption by 50%. Can you tell me what is the maximum number of miles each bus can now travel on one gallon of fuel? \nHint: This puzzle requires some mathematical calculations related to fuel efficiency. So, put your thinking caps on and try to figure it out!"

        "content": "To solve this puzzle, we need to determine how to improve the fuel efficiency of the buses so that the city can meet its goal of reducing fuel consumption by 50%.\n\nInitially, each bus can travel 25 miles per gallon of fuel. To achieve a 50% reduction in fuel consumption, each bus must effectively travel twice the distance it currently does on the same amount of fuel, because using half the fuel means doubling the efficiency.\n\nTherefore, if the original efficiency is 25 miles per gallon, doubling this efficiency would result in:\n\n\\[ 25 \\text{ miles/gallon} \\times 2 = 50 \\text{ miles/gallon} \\]\n\nThus, to reduce fuel consumption by 50%, each bus would need to travel a maximum of 50 miles on one gallon of fuel."
