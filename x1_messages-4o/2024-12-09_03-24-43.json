How can I set this permanently so it persists across different sessions?"

        "content": "To permanently add a directory to the `$PATH` environment variable on a Linux/Unix system, you need to modify one of your shell's configuration files. The specific file you modify will depend on the shell you are using (e.g., Bash, Zsh, etc.) and whether you want the change to affect only your user account or all users. Here are the steps to do this for the most common shell, Bash:\n\n1. **Identify the Configuration File**:\n   - For changes that affect only your user account, you can modify `~/.bashrc` (common for interactive non-login shells) or `~/.bash_profile` (common for login shells).\n   - For changes that affect all users, you can modify `/etc/profile` or scripts within `/etc/profile.d/`.\n\n2. **Edit the Configuration File**:\n   - Open the appropriate file in a text editor. For example, to edit `~/.bashrc`, you can use:\n     ```sh\n     nano ~/.bashrc\n     ```\n   - Add the following line at the end of the file to append your directory to the current `$PATH`:\n     ```sh\n     export PATH=\"$PATH:/path/to/dir\"\n     ```\n   - Save the file and exit the text editor.\n\n3. **Apply the Changes**:\n   - To apply the changes immediately without needing to restart the terminal, you can source the file. For example:\n     ```sh\n     source ~/.bashrc\n     ```\n   - Alternatively, you can close the current terminal session and open a new one to see the changes take effect.\n\nBy following these steps, the specified directory should be permanently added to your `$PATH`, and the change should persist across different terminal sessions. If you are using a different shell, you'll need to edit the corresponding configuration file for that shell, such as `~/.zshrc` for Zsh."
