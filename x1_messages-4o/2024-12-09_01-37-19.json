        "content": "It looks like you're on the right track with using `cx_Freeze`. However, there's a minor typo in your `setup.py` file that might be causing issues. Let's look at the potential issues and correct them:\n\n1. **Typo in the Code**: In the `setup()` function, the key `exectuables` should be `executables`. Correct the typo as follows:\n\n    ```python\n    from cx_Freeze import setup, Executable\n\n    setup(\n        name=\"On Dijkstra's Algorithm\",\n        version=\"3.1\",\n        description=\"A Dijkstra's Algorithm help tool.\",\n        executables=[Executable(script=\"Main.py\", base=\"Win32GUI\")]\n    )\n    ```\n\n2. **Check Python Version**: Ensure you're using a compatible version of Python with `cx_Freeze`. Sometimes, issues arise due to version incompatibility.\n\n3. **Verify Command Line Usage**:\n   - Make sure you're in the directory where your `setup.py` file is located.\n   - Open a command prompt or terminal.\n   - Navigate to the directory containing your `setup.py` file.\n   - Run the command:\n\n     ```sh\n     python setup.py build\n     ```\n\n   If you're using Python 3 and your system's default Python is version 2.x, you might need to specify `python3` instead:\n\n   ```sh\n   python3 setup.py build\n   ```\n\n4. **Ensure Dependencies are Installed**: Make sure `cx_Freeze` is installed. You can install it via pip if it's not already installed:\n\n   ```sh\n   pip install cx_Freeze\n   ```\n\n5. **Check for Additional Errors**: If you still encounter errors, carefully read the error message provided. It might give you clues about what else could be wrong.\n\n6. **Use Virtual Environment**: If you are managing different projects, it's often a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can create one using:\n\n   ```sh\n   python -m venv myenv\n   ```\n\n   Activate it using:\n   - On Windows: `myenv\\Scripts\\activate`\n   - On macOS/Linux: `source myenv/bin/activate`\n\n7. **Base Parameter**: The `base` parameter might need to be adjusted depending on your system and whether you're building a console or GUI application. It\u2019s typically `None` for console applications and `\"Win32GUI\"` for GUI applications on Windows.\n\nIf you follow these steps and correct the typo, you should be able to successfully build your application using `cx_Freeze`. If there are further errors, please provide the error message for more specific troubleshooting."
