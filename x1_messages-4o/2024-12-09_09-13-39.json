Here's a simple Python code snippet to check if a given word is a palindrome:\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(word):\n    # Convert the word to lowercase to ensure the check is case-insensitive\n    word = word.lower()\n    \n    # Reverse the word and compare it to the original\n    return word == word[::-1]\n\n# Example usage\nword = input(\"Enter a word: \")\nif is_palindrome(word):\n    print(f\"'{word}' is a palindrome.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"'{word}' is not a palindrome.\")\n```\n\nThis code takes a word as input, converts it to lowercase to make the check case-insensitive, reverses the string, and then checks if the reversed string is the same as the original. If they are the same, the word is a palindrome."
