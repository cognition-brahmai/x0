Here's my code for reference:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport sqlite3\nconn = sqlite3.connect('factbook.db')\nquery = \"select * from facts where area_land =0;\"\nfacts = pd.read_sql_query(query,conn)\nprint(list(facts.columns.values))\n\ndef final_pop(initial_pop,growth_rate):\n    final = initial_pop*math.e**(growth_rate*35)\n    return(final)\n\nfacts['pop2050'] = facts['population','population_growth'].apply(final_pop,axis=1)\n```"

        "content": "The error in your code arises from how you're using the `apply` function on your DataFrame. The `apply` function should be called on a DataFrame or Series, and when used on a DataFrame, the function you pass to `apply` should take a row or column as its argument, depending on the axis specified.\n\nIn your case, it appears you're trying to apply a function to each row, using two columns ('population' and 'population_growth') as inputs to your function `final_pop`. Here's how you can correctly apply the function to each row:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport sqlite3\nimport math\n\n# Connect to the SQLite database\nconn = sqlite3.connect('factbook.db')\n\n# Execute the query and load the data into a DataFrame\nquery = \"SELECT * FROM facts WHERE area_land = 0;\"\nfacts = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)\n\n# Define the custom function to calculate final population\ndef final_pop(row):\n    initial_pop = row['population']\n    growth_rate = row['population_growth']\n    final = initial_pop * math.e ** (growth_rate * 35)\n    return final\n\n# Apply the function to each row in the DataFrame\nfacts['pop2050'] = facts.apply(final_pop, axis=1)\n\n# Check the result\nprint(facts[['population', 'population_growth', 'pop2050']])\n```\n\nKey changes and explanations:\n\n1. **Import `math`:** Make sure you've imported the `math` module to use `math.e`.\n\n2. **Use `apply` with a function that takes a row as an argument:** The `final_pop` function now takes a single argument `row`, which represents each row in the DataFrame when `apply` is used with `axis=1`.\n\n3. **Access columns within the row:** Inside the `final_pop` function, extract the values for `initial_pop` and `growth_rate` using `row['column_name']`.\n\n4. **Apply on the entire DataFrame with `axis=1`:** The `apply` function is used on the DataFrame `facts`, with `axis=1` indicating that the function should be applied to each row.\n\nThis should resolve the error and correctly compute the 'pop2050' column based on the formula provided."
