        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the incorrect usage of the query method in SQLAlchemy. The main issues are with how the `query` method is structured and how you're using `load_only`. To select a specific column with a filter in SQLAlchemy, you should use the `filter` method alongside a correct query structure.\n\nHere's how you can adjust your code to achieve this:\n\n1. Use `filter()` instead of chaining the condition directly after the model.\n2. Use `with_entities()` to specify the columns you want to select.\n3. Return a value that Flask can convert into a response.\n\nHere's a revised version of your code:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import jsonify\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import session\n\n@application.route(\"/user\", methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef user():\n    # Query the User table, filtering by the validation cookie, and selecting only the 'id' column\n    user_id = session.query(User.id).filter(User.validation == request.cookies.get(\"validation\")).all()\n    \n    # Commit the session if necessary (usually for changes, not selects)\n    # session.commit()  # Comment this out if you're not making changes to the database\n    \n    # Return the result in a format Flask can handle, such as JSON\n    return jsonify([id[0] for id in user_id])  # Convert the result to a list of IDs\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`with_entities(User.id)`**: This method is used to specify which columns you want to include in your query. In this case, you only want the `id` column.\n- **`filter(User.validation == request.cookies.get(\"validation\"))`**: The `filter` method is used to add a WHERE clause to your query.\n- **`all()`**: This executes the query and returns a list of results. If you expect only one result, you can use `first()` instead.\n- **`jsonify()`**: This is used to convert the result into JSON format, which is a common response format in web applications.\n\nBy following this structure, you should be able to query only the `id` column with your desired filter condition and avoid the 'Query object is not callable' error."
