        "content": "In Python's Pandas library, the `read_csv` function traditionally supports only single-character delimiters using the `sep` parameter. However, if you want to use multi-character delimiters like \"*|*\" or \"%%\", you can achieve this by using the `pandas` `read_csv` in combination with the `Python` `StringIO` and `re` modules to preprocess your data. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using `StringIO` and `re`**: You can read the file as a whole, use regular expressions to replace your multi-character delimiter with a single character delimiter, and then use `read_csv`.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport re\nfrom io import StringIO\n\n# Sample data\ndata = \"\"\"column1*|*column2*|*column3\n1*|*2*|*3\n4*|*5*|*6\n7*|*8*|*9\"\"\"\n\n# Replace the multi-character delimiter with a single character delimiter\ndata_single_char_delim = re.sub(r'\\*\\|\\*', ',', data)\n\n# Use StringIO to simulate a file object\ndata_io = StringIO(data_single_char_delim)\n\n# Read the data using read_csv\ndf = pd.read_csv(data_io)\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `re.sub(r'\\*\\|\\*', ',', data)` function is used to replace the \"*|*\" delimiter with a comma, which is a single character delimiter that `read_csv` can handle. The `StringIO` module is used to create a file-like object from the string, allowing `read_csv` to read from it as if it were a regular file.\n\n2. **Using `pandas` with `engine='python'`**: Another option is to use the `engine='python'` parameter in `read_csv`, which allows for more flexibility with delimiters but may not always be the best approach for performance with large datasets. However, it can handle regex patterns for delimiters:\n\n```python\ndf = pd.read_csv(StringIO(data), sep=r'\\*\\|\\*', engine='python')\nprint(df)\n```\n\nIn this example, `sep=r'\\*\\|\\*'` uses a regular expression to specify the delimiter directly in the `read_csv` function with the Python engine.\n\nChoose the method that best fits your use case, considering the size of your data and performance requirements."
