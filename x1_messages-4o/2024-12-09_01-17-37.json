I've installed PyInstaller under Python 3.5 using the command `python3.5 -m pip install pyinstaller`. If I run the same command again, I'm told that PyInstaller is already installed. However, when I try to run a script with PyInstaller using `python3.5 -m pyinstaller mypython35script.py`, I receive an error message stating \"No module named pyinstaller\". Why is this happening and what am I doing wrong?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering typically stems from the fact that the Python environment where PyInstaller was installed is not the same one being used when you attempt to run it. This is a common issue when multiple versions of Python are installed on the same system. Here are some steps to help resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify Installation in the Correct Environment:**\n   Ensure that PyInstaller is installed in the Python 3.5 environment. You can check this by running:\n   ```bash\n   python3.5 -m pip show pyinstaller\n   ```\n   This should display details about the PyInstaller package if it's correctly installed.\n\n2. **Check Python Path:**\n   Ensure that the Python interpreter being used is the one where PyInstaller is installed. You can check which Python interpreter is being used by running:\n   ```bash\n   which python3.5\n   ```\n   Make sure this path matches the one where PyInstaller was installed.\n\n3. **Use Virtual Environments:**\n   It\u2019s a good practice to use virtual environments to manage dependencies for different projects. Here's how you can set up a virtual environment for Python 3.5 and install PyInstaller in it:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.5 -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n   pip install pyinstaller\n   ```\n\n   After activating the virtual environment, try running PyInstaller with:\n   ```bash\n   pyinstaller mypython35script.py\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for Aliases or PATH Issues:**\n   If you have any shell aliases or PATH settings that might be overriding the `python3.5` command, check your shell configuration files like `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zshrc`.\n\n5. **Reinstall PyInstaller:**\n   If none of the above works, you might want to try reinstalling PyInstaller to ensure a clean installation:\n   ```bash\n   python3.5 -m pip uninstall pyinstaller\n   python3.5 -m pip install pyinstaller\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully use PyInstaller with Python 3.5 on your Mac OS Sierra."
