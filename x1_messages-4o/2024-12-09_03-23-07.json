        "content": "To find the three highest scores and their corresponding names, you can use the `zip` function to combine the scores and names, then sort them based on the scores, and finally extract the top three entries. Here's how you can do it in Python:\n\n```python\n# Your existing lists\nscore = [350, 914, 569, 223, 947, 284, 567, 333, 697, 245, 227, 785, 120, 794, 343, 773, 293, 995]\nname = [\"Ryan\", \"Stacy\", \"Jenna\", \"Peter\", \"Sophie\", \"Bryan\", \"Cole\", \"Andrea\", \"Emily\", \"Blake\", \"Mike\", \"Stephan\", \"Rob\", \"Eliza\", \"Heather\", \"Daniel\", \"Elisabeth\", \"Samantha\"]\n\n# Combine the scores and names into a list of tuples\ncombined = list(zip(score, name))\n\n# Sort the combined list by scores in descending order\nsorted_combined = sorted(combined, key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)\n\n# Extract the top 3 scores and names\ntop3score = [entry[0] for entry in sorted_combined[:3]]\ntop3name = [entry[1] for entry in sorted_combined[:3]]\n\n# Print results\nprint(\"Top 3 Scores:\", top3score)\nprint(\"Top 3 Names:\", top3name)\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n\n```\nTop 3 Scores: [995, 947, 914]\nTop 3 Names: ['Samantha', 'Sophie', 'Stacy']\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that you accurately identify the top three scores and their corresponding names by leveraging Python's powerful list manipulation capabilities."
