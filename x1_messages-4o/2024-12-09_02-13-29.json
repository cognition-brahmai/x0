I performed a GridSearch and found the best parameters to be 'max_features': 0.6 and 'max_samples': 1.0. However, when I calculated the number of samples per each base estimator using my understanding of the parameter, I found it to be around 712. Yet, the number I got from counting the samples was in the range 564 +/- 10, with a maximum value of 587. Can anyone explain this discrepancy?"

        "content": "The 'max_samples' parameter in a Bagging Classifier determines the fraction or the absolute number of samples to draw from the training set for each base estimator. In your case, setting `max_samples=1.0` means that each base estimator should be trained on 100% of the training data, with replacement, because bagging typically involves sampling with replacement (bootstrapping).\n\nHere's a breakdown of why you might be seeing discrepancies:\n\n1. **Sampling with Replacement**: When sampling with replacement, it's possible for some samples to be selected more than once, while others may not be selected at all. This can lead to the effective number of unique samples in each bootstrap sample being less than the total number of samples. On average, about 63.2% of the original samples are unique in each bootstrap sample when sampling with replacement.\n\n2. **Expectation vs. Reality**: Your expectation of 712 samples likely comes from assuming that all samples are unique. However, due to the nature of bootstrapping, the number of unique samples is expected to be lower, which aligns more closely with the 564 +/- 10 range you observed.\n\n3. **Random Variation**: The variation in the number of unique samples (564 +/- 10) can be attributed to the randomness inherent in the bootstrap sampling process.\n\n4. **Data Size**: If the total number of samples in your training set is approximately 712, then your observations are consistent with the expected behavior of bootstrapping.\n\nIn summary, the discrepancy arises because 'max_samples=1.0' refers to the total number of samples drawn (with replacement), not the number of unique samples used. The latter is typically lower due to the nature of bootstrapping."
