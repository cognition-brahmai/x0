        "content": "The \"bad interpreter\" error you're encountering is commonly due to a mismatch in line endings between different operating systems. It looks like your script has been edited or saved with Windows-style line endings (CRLF), which include a carriage return (`^M`) character that isn't recognized by Unix-based systems like Linux or macOS. This is why you're seeing the `^M` in the error message.\n\nTo fix this issue in PyCharm, you can change the line endings to Unix-style (LF). Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Open the file in PyCharm**: Open your script (`main.py`) in PyCharm.\n\n2. **Change Line Endings**:\n   - Look for the line endings indicator at the bottom right corner of the PyCharm window. It might show something like \"CRLF\" if the file is using Windows-style line endings.\n   - Click on that indicator, and a menu will appear. Select \"LF - Unix and OS X (\\n)\" to convert the line endings to Unix style.\n\n3. **Save the File**: After changing the line endings, make sure to save the file.\n\n4. **Verify the Shebang Line**: Ensure that the shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/python`) correctly points to your Python interpreter. You can check the actual path of your Python interpreter by running `which python` or `which python3` in your terminal and updating the shebang line accordingly if needed.\n\n5. **Re-run the Script**: Try running your script again with the executable permission (`chmod +x main.py`) as before.\n\nBy converting the line endings to Unix-style, the `^M` characters should be removed, and the script should execute without the \"bad interpreter\" error."
