I understand that on Windows, this can be achieved with STARTUPINFO, but this is not valid on Linux and throws an error \"ValueError: startupinfo is only supported on Windows platforms\". Is there a simpler method to achieve this without creating a separate Popen command for each Operating System? The current code I have is as follows:\n\n```python\nif os.name == 'nt':\n    startupinfo = subprocess.STARTUPINFO()\n    startupinfo.dwFlags |= subprocess.STARTF_USESHOWWINDOW\n    proc = subprocess.Popen(command, startupinfo=startupinfo)\nif os.name == 'posix':\n    proc = subprocess.Popen(command)    \n```"

        "content": "To handle the process invisibility on both Windows and Linux platforms without having to write separate `Popen` commands, you can use a unified approach by setting the process creation flags and standard input/output redirections appropriately. Here's a way to achieve this:\n\n1. **Windows**: Use `STARTUPINFO` to hide the window.\n2. **Linux (POSIX)**: Redirect standard input, output, and error to `/dev/null` to make it \"invisible\" in terms of IO.\n\nHere's a modified version of your code that handles both platforms using a single `Popen` command:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\n\ndef start_invisible_process(command):\n    if os.name == 'nt':\n        # Windows\n        startupinfo = subprocess.STARTUPINFO()\n        startupinfo.dwFlags |= subprocess.STARTF_USESHOWWINDOW\n        proc = subprocess.Popen(command, startupinfo=startupinfo, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, stdin=subprocess.PIPE)\n    else:\n        # POSIX (Linux, macOS, etc.)\n        with open(os.devnull, 'w') as devnull:\n            proc = subprocess.Popen(command, stdout=devnull, stderr=devnull, stdin=devnull)\n\n    return proc\n\n# Example usage\ncommand = [\"your_command_here\"]\nproc = start_invisible_process(command)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Windows**: The `STARTUPINFO` structure is used to suppress the console window.\n- **POSIX**: Redirect `stdout`, `stderr`, and `stdin` to `os.devnull` to effectively make the process silent and \"invisible\" in the terminal.\n\nThis approach keeps your code cleaner and more maintainable by using a single function to handle process creation across different platforms. Just replace `\"your_command_here\"` with the actual command you want to run."
