For example, how can I calculate cosine similarity for vectors v1 = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] and v2 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]? According to the classic formula, it leads to a division by zero. I want to use this similarity measure in a clustering application and I will often need to compare such vectors. Also, how can I calculate the cosine similarity between vectors [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] vs. [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] and vectors [1, 1, 1, 0, 0] vs. [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]?"

        "content": "Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. The formula for cosine similarity between two vectors \\( v1 \\) and \\( v2 \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{cosine\\_similarity}(v1, v2) = \\frac{v1 \\cdot v2}{\\|v1\\| \\times \\|v2\\|}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( v1 \\cdot v2 \\) is the dot product of the vectors, and \\( \\|v1\\| \\) and \\( \\|v2\\| \\) are the magnitudes (or Euclidean norms) of the vectors.\n\n1. **Case: Comparing with a Zero Vector**  \n   When one of the vectors is a zero vector, such as \\( v2 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] \\), the magnitude \\( \\|v2\\| \\) becomes zero, leading to division by zero. In this case, cosine similarity is undefined in the traditional sense because the angle between a non-zero vector and a zero vector is undefined.\n\n   **Approach:**  \n   - Assign a similarity score of 0 for any comparison involving a zero vector. This reflects the intuition that a zero vector has no direction, and thus no meaningful similarity with any non-zero vector.\n\n2. **Case: Both Vectors are Zero Vectors**  \n   When both vectors are zero vectors, both magnitudes are zero, again leading to division by zero.\n\n   **Approach:**  \n   - Assign a similarity score of 1 when both vectors are zero vectors. This is because they are identical (though directionless), thus perfectly similar.\n\n3. **Example Calculations**  \n   - For vectors \\( v1 = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] \\) and \\( v2 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] \\): Cosine similarity = 0.\n   - For vectors \\( v1 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] \\) and \\( v2 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] \\): Cosine similarity = 1.\n   - For vectors \\( v1 = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0] \\) and \\( v2 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] \\): Cosine similarity = 0.\n\nBy adopting these conventions, you can handle zero vectors consistently in your clustering application, ensuring that similarities are meaningful and do not result in errors due to undefined operations."
