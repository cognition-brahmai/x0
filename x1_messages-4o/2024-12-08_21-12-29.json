I see food, and I eat it before my workout.\"**\n   - **Explanation:** A play on words with \"seafood\" and \"see food,\" this joke makes light of eating habits by implying an indulgence in food before exercising.\n\n7. **\"I do planks because my inner child wants a timeout.\"**\n   - **Explanation:** This one-liner humorously compares holding a plank position to taking a timeout, associating a strenuous exercise with a childhood discipline method.\n\n8. **\"Why lift weights? Because my wallet needs to be heavier.\"**\n   - **Explanation:** Here, lifting weights is humorously linked to the desire for financial gain, making light of the pursuit of muscle mass and wealth.\n\n9. **\"My gym schedule is a real 'no-pain, no-gain' policy... mostly 'no show, no gain.'\"**\n   - **Explanation:** This twist on the classic \"no pain, no gain\" motto humorously admits to skipping the gym, making fun of personal fitness commitment levels.\n\n10. **\"I stretch every morning \u2013 mostly to reach for the remote.\"**\n   - **Explanation:** This joke envisions stretching, a beneficial exercise habit, as merely a means to reach the remote control, emphasizing laziness over athleticism.\n\nThese one-liners cleverly mix fitness themes with everyday humor, making them relatable and funny to those who frequent the gym or engage in any form of exercise."
