I want to create a subclass of `object`, named `fancyobject`, that behaves identically to `object` but outputs different results when `str` and `repr` are applied to it. I am aware of the `__str__` special method, but I believe it only gets called when `str` is invoked on instances of `A`, not when it's invoked on `A` itself."

        "content": "In Python, the `__str__` and `__repr__` methods are used to define string representations of objects. The `__str__` method is intended to provide a \"pretty\" or user-friendly string representation of an object, while `__repr__` is intended to provide a more detailed and unambiguous string representation that can often be used to recreate the object.\n\nTo have different outputs for `str` and `repr` when called on an instance of a subclass, you need to define both `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in your class. Here\u2019s how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nclass FancyObject:\n    def __init__(self, name, value):\n        self.name = name\n        self.value = value\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        # Return a user-friendly string representation\n        return f\"FancyObject: {self.name}\"\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        # Return a detailed string representation\n        return f\"FancyObject(name={self.name!r}, value={self.value!r})\"\n\n# Example usage:\nobj = FancyObject('Sample', 42)\n\n# Using str on the instance\nprint(str(obj))  # Output: FancyObject: Sample\n\n# Using repr on the instance\nprint(repr(obj))  # Output: FancyObject(name='Sample', value=42)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `FancyObject` class has both `__str__` and `__repr__` methods. The `__str__` method returns a simple, user-friendly string that might be useful for end-user display, while the `__repr__` method returns a more detailed string that could be useful for debugging and logging, or to recreate the object with `eval()` (if the object is simple enough and all necessary imports are available).\n\nWhen you call `str()` on an instance of `FancyObject`, Python will use the `__str__` method. When you call `repr()` or simply print the object in interactive mode, Python will use the `__repr__` method. This allows you to have different outputs for `str` and `repr` for the same object instance."
