My current code only prompts the user to input text, as shown below:\n\n```python\ntext = input(\"TEXT=\")\n```\n\nWhat I want to achieve is to have a predefined string after the prompt, that users can adjust if needed. The interaction would look something like this:\n\n```shell\npython3 file\nTEXT=thepredefinedtextishere\n```\n\nIf I press Backspace 3 times, it should look like this:\n\n```shell\nTEXT=thepredefinedtextish\n```\n\nOn pressing Enter, the variable 'text' should then be 'thepredefinedtextish'. Is there a way to implement this functionality in Python?"

        "content": "To achieve the functionality of pre-filling user input in the command line interface, you can make use of the `readline` module in Python. This module provides a way to manipulate the input behavior in the terminal, allowing you to set a predefined input text that users can edit before submission. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n1. First, ensure that the `readline` module is available. It should be included by default in most Python installations on Linux.\n\n2. Use the `readline` module to set the initial text.\n\nHere's a sample code snippet to demonstrate how to prefill user input:\n\n```python\nimport readline\n\ndef prefill_input(prompt, prefill):\n    # Set the prefill text\n    readline.set_startup_hook(lambda: readline.insert_text(prefill))\n    try:\n        return input(prompt)\n    finally:\n        # Remove the startup hook to clean up for any future inputs\n        readline.set_startup_hook()\n\n# Example usage\ntext = prefill_input(\"TEXT=\", \"thepredefinedtextishere\")\nprint(\"You entered:\", text)\n```\n\n### How it Works:\n- The `readline.set_startup_hook()` function allows you to set a hook that will run just before `input()` is called.\n- By using `readline.insert_text(prefill)`, you can insert the predefined text into the input field.\n- The `try...finally` block ensures that the startup hook is removed after the input is taken, so it doesn't affect other input calls.\n\nThis will give you the desired behavior where the user can see a pre-filled text and modify it as needed before pressing Enter."
