For example, I have the following number that prints out in exponential form:\n\n```python\na = 1/1221759\nprint(a)\n```\n\nThis code generates the output `8.184920266599223e-07`. How can I make it print in its normal form?"

        "content": "To print a float number in its normal form instead of its exponential form or scientific notation in Python, you can use string formatting methods such as `format()`, f-strings, or the `%.xf` format specifier. Here are a few ways you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Using `format()` function:**\n\n```python\na = 1 / 1221759\nprint(format(a, '.10f'))  # Adjust the number of decimal places as needed\n```\n\n2. **Using f-strings (Python 3.6+):**\n\n```python\na = 1 / 1221759\nprint(f'{a:.10f}')  # Adjust the number of decimal places as needed\n```\n\n3. **Using the `%` operator:**\n\n```python\na = 1 / 1221759\nprint('%.10f' % a)  # Adjust the number of decimal places as needed\n```\n\nIn all of the above cases, `'.10f'` specifies that you want to format the number as a fixed-point number with 10 decimal places. You can adjust the number of decimal places to suit your needs."
