The asterisk `[*]` serves as a placeholder to show that the computation is in progress. Once the cell has finished executing, the asterisk is replaced with a number that corresponds to the order in which the cell was executed in the current session. This number helps track the sequence of executed cells. If a cell takes a long time to run and you see `In [*]`, it means it's still being processed."
