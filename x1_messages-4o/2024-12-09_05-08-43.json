These are coming from separate data sources and I need to convert them to the same format to compare them. What are these formats and how can I convert them to a common format in Python?"

        "content": "The date-time strings you are dealing with are in ISO 8601 format, which is a widely used format for representing date and time. The 'Z' at the end signifies that the time is in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).\n\nTo compare these date-time strings in Python, you can use the `datetime` module, which provides functionality to parse ISO 8601 date-time strings and convert them into `datetime` objects. Once they are in `datetime` format, you can easily compare them or convert them to any desired format.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Define your date-time strings\ndate_str1 = '2013-07-12T07:00:00Z'\ndate_str2 = '2013-07-10T11:00:00.000Z'\n\n# Convert them to datetime objects\ndate1 = datetime.strptime(date_str1, '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')\ndate2 = datetime.strptime(date_str2, '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ')\n\n# Now you can compare them or convert them to a common format\nprint(\"Date 1:\", date1)\nprint(\"Date 2:\", date2)\n\n# Example of converting to a common string format\ncommon_format1 = date1.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')\ncommon_format2 = date2.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')\n\nprint(\"Common Format 1:\", common_format1)\nprint(\"Common Format 2:\", common_format2)\n```\n\nIn this example, both date-time strings are converted to the `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S` format. You can choose any other format as needed. The `strptime` function is used to parse the strings into `datetime` objects, and `strftime` is used to format the `datetime` objects into strings."
