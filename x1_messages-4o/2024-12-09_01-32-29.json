        "content": "It seems like you are encountering an issue with importing `pywrap_tensorflow` after installing TensorFlow. The error can stem from a few different causes, such as version incompatibility, incorrect installation, or missing dependencies. Here's a step-by-step guide to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Python Version**: Ensure that you are using a supported Python version for the TensorFlow version you installed. TensorFlow 0.7.1 is quite old, and you might be using a version of Python that is not compatible. Consider upgrading to a more recent version of TensorFlow if possible.\n\n2. **Use Virtual Environment**: It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev python-virtualenv\n   virtualenv --system-site-packages -p python2.7 ~/tensorflow-env\n   source ~/tensorflow-env/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n3. **Install TensorFlow in Virtual Environment**:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.7.1-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for Missing Dependencies**: Ensure that all the dependencies are properly installed, especially `six`, `protobuf`, and `numpy`. You can install them manually:\n   ```bash\n   pip install six==1.10.0 protobuf==3.0.0b2 numpy>=1.8.2\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify Installation**: After installation, verify if TensorFlow is correctly installed by importing it in a Python shell:\n   ```python\n   python -c \"import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)\"\n   ```\n\n6. **Check System Libraries**: Ensure that all required system libraries are available. Sometimes TensorFlow needs additional system libraries, especially for older versions.\n\n7. **Permissions Issue**: If you ran the installation with `sudo`, there could be a permissions issue. Make sure your user has the necessary permissions to access the directories used by pip.\n\n8. **Upgrade to a Newer Version**: If possible, consider upgrading to a newer and more stable version of TensorFlow. Newer versions have better support and are easier to install.\n\n9. **Check TensorFlow Installation Path**: Ensure that the installation path does not have any conflicting files from previous installations. Clean up old installations if necessary.\n\n10. **Debugging Details**: If the problem persists, post the full error log and any additional details about your environment, such as OS version, Python version, and any custom configurations.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the import error. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
