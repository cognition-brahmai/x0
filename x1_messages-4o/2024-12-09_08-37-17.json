        "content": "To merge 200 separate CSV files named sequentially from `SH (1).csv` to `SH (200).csv` into a single CSV file using Python, you can use the `pandas` library. It's a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n1. **Install pandas**: If you haven't already, you'll need to install the `pandas` library. You can do this using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pandas\n   ```\n\n2. **Merge the CSV files**: You can use the following script to merge all the CSV files into a single file:\n\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n   import os\n\n   # List to store dataframes\n   dataframes = []\n\n   # Iterate over the range of files\n   for i in range(1, 201):\n       # Construct the file name\n       filename = f\"SH ({i}).csv\"\n       \n       # Read the CSV file\n       df = pd.read_csv(filename)\n       \n       # Append dataframe to the list\n       dataframes.append(df)\n\n   # Concatenate all dataframes into a single one\n   merged_dataframe = pd.concat(dataframes, ignore_index=True)\n\n   # Save the merged dataframe to a new CSV file\n   merged_dataframe.to_csv('merged_file.csv', index=False)\n   ```\n\n3. **Explanation**:\n   - **Import pandas**: The script begins by importing the pandas library.\n   - **Dataframe List**: A list `dataframes` is initialized to store individual dataframes.\n   - **Loop through files**: A loop is run from 1 to 200 to read each CSV file. The file name is constructed dynamically using an f-string.\n   - **Read and Append**: Each CSV is read into a dataframe using `pd.read_csv()` and appended to the list.\n   - **Concatenate**: `pd.concat()` is used to merge all the dataframes into a single dataframe.\n   - **Save to CSV**: The merged dataframe is saved to a new CSV file named `merged_file.csv` using `to_csv()`.\n\nThis script will create a new CSV file combining all rows from each of the 200 files. Make sure all CSV files are in the same directory from which you are running the script, or provide the full path to each file if they're stored elsewhere."
