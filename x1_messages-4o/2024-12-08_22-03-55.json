The list should be in alphabetical order.\nHere is an example code using Ruby:\nanimals = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"bird\", \"lion\", \"tiger\"]\nwalks = [\"power\", \"moon\", \"sun\", \"star\", \"sky\"]\nwords = []\nanimals.each do |animal|\n  walks.each do |walk|\n    new_word = \"#{animal}-#{walk}\"\n    words << new_word\n  end\nend\nunique_words = words.uniq.sort\nputs unique_words\nIs there a more efficient way to achieve the same result in Ruby?"

        "content": "To achieve the same result more efficiently in Ruby, you can leverage Ruby's built-in methods to make the code more concise and potentially more performant. Here's a streamlined version using a combination of `Array#product` and `Array#map`:\n\n```ruby\nanimals = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"bird\", \"lion\", \"tiger\"]\nwalks = [\"power\", \"moon\", \"sun\", \"star\", \"sky\"]\n\n# Use Array#product to get all combinations, then map to format them\nunique_words = animals.product(walks).map { |animal, walk| \"#{animal}-#{walk}\" }.uniq.sort\n\nputs unique_words\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Array#product**: This method generates all possible combinations of the elements from the two arrays (`animals` and `walks`). It returns an array of arrays, where each sub-array contains one element from each of the input arrays.\n\n2. **Array#map**: This is used to iterate over the combinations and format each combination into a string in the desired \"animal-walk\" format.\n\n3. **uniq**: Although in this specific case `uniq` is not necessary because `product` with two distinct lists won't generate duplicates, it's good practice to include it if there's a possibility of duplicates in more complex scenarios.\n\n4. **sort**: Finally, `sort` arranges the list in alphabetical order.\n\nThis approach is clear and concise and takes advantage of Ruby's expressive methods to handle the task efficiently."
