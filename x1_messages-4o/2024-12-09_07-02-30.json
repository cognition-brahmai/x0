The `Path` object in `pathlib` provides a more intuitive and object-oriented way to handle filesystem paths compared to `os.path`.\n\nHere's how you can get the folder name using `pathlib`:\n\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# Assume 'file_path' is the path to your file\nfile_path = Path('/path/to/your/file.txt')\n\n# Get the parent directory of the file\nparent_directory = file_path.parent\n\n# If you want just the name of the directory\nfolder_name = parent_directory.name\n\nprint(\"Parent directory:\", parent_directory)\nprint(\"Folder name:\", folder_name)\n```\n\nIn this example, `file_path.parent` gives you the `Path` object representing the parent directory of the file, and `parent_directory.name` gives you just the name of that directory. This is the `pathlib` equivalent of `os.path.dirname(path)`, but it provides more flexibility and readability."
