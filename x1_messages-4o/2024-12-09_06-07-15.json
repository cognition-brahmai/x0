Although MATLAB has PCA implemented, I prefer to write my own code to better understand the technical details. I followed a guide for this, but I'm getting results that are different from the built-in function princomp. Could anyone review my code and guide me on how to correct it? Here is the code I've been working on:\n\n```\nfunction [mu, Ev, Val ] = pca(data)\n\n% mu - mean image\n% Ev - matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigen\n% values Val \n% Val - eigenvalues\n\nif nargin ~= 1\n error ('usage: [mu,E,Values] = pca_q1(data)');\nend\n\nmu = mean(data)';\n\nnimages = size(data,2);\n\nfor i = 1:nimages\n data(:,i) = data(:,i)-mu(i);\nend\n\nL = data'*data;\n[Ev, Vals]  = eig(L);    \n[Ev,Vals] = sort(Ev,Vals);\n\n% computing eigenvector of the real covariance matrix\nEv = data * Ev;\n\nVal = diag(Vals);\nVals = Vals / (nimages - 1);\n\n% normalize Ev to unit length\nproper = 0;\nfor i = 1:nimages\n Ev(:,i) = Ev(:,1)/norm(Ev(:,i));\n if Vals(i) < 0.00001\n  Ev(:,i) = zeros(size(Ev,1),1);\n else\n  proper = proper+1;\n end;\nend;\n\nEv = Ev(:,1:nimages);\n```"

        "content": "Your implementation of PCA using eigenvalue decomposition has a few issues that could be causing the discrepancy between your results and MATLAB's built-in `princomp` function. Let's go through the code and make some necessary corrections:\n\n1. **Mean Calculation and Centering Data**: You should subtract the mean from each feature across all data points, not from each data point. Also, ensure the mean is subtracted from the correct dimension.\n\n2. **Data Matrix**: Your data matrix should be organized such that each column corresponds to a data point and each row corresponds to a feature. This impacts how you center the data and compute the covariance matrix.\n\n3. **Covariance Matrix**: You are computing `L = data'*data`, which is correct if `data` is centered. However, ensure that you are computing the covariance matrix correctly.\n\n4. **Eigenvalue and Eigenvector Calculation**: The line `[Ev, Vals] = sort(Ev, Vals);` is incorrect because `sort` is not applicable to matrices in this context. You need to sort the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors properly.\n\n5. **Normalization**: The eigenvectors should be normalized correctly. Currently, you are normalizing using `Ev(:,1)/norm(Ev(:,i))`, which seems incorrect. It should be `Ev(:,i) = Ev(:,i)/norm(Ev(:,i));`.\n\nHere's a revised version of your PCA function:\n\n```matlab\nfunction [mu, Ev, Val] = pca(data)\n\n% mu - mean of each feature\n% Ev - matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues Val\n% Val - eigenvalues\n\nif nargin ~= 1\n    error('usage: [mu, Ev, Val] = pca(data)');\nend\n\n% Compute the mean of each feature\nmu = mean(data, 2);\n\n% Subtract the mean from each feature\ndata_centered = data - mu;\n\n% Compute the covariance matrix\nL = (data_centered' * data_centered) / (size(data, 2) - 1);\n\n% Eigenvalue decomposition\n[Ev, D] = eig(L);\n\n% Extract eigenvalues\nVal = diag(D);\n\n% Sort eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors in descending order\n[Val, idx] = sort(Val, 'descend');\nEv = Ev(:, idx);\n\n% Compute the eigenvectors of the original covariance matrix\nEv = data_centered * Ev;\n\n% Normalize eigenvectors to unit length\nfor i = 1:size(Ev, 2)\n    Ev(:, i) = Ev(:, i) / norm(Ev(:, i));\nend\n\nend\n```\n\nMake sure the input data is arranged correctly, with rows as features and columns as data points. This version corrects the dimension issues and properly handles sorting and normalization of eigenvectors. Test this revised code and see if it provides results closer to MATLAB's built-in function."
