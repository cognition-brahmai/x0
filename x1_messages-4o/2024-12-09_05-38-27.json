When I use 'pip3 install <package>', I get a message saying 'Defaulting to user installation because normal site-packages is not writeable' and then it says the package is already installed. But when I try to access it using 'import <package>', it's not found. I suspect this is a permissions issue where pip can't install to the \"base\" python, and python can't find what I've installed into '~/Library/Python/3.7/site-packages'. How can I fix these permissions? Where should I ideally install packages?"

        "content": "It sounds like you're encountering a common issue with Python package installations on systems where you don't have the necessary permissions to install packages system-wide. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Use a Virtual Environment**: This is often the best solution, as it avoids permission issues and keeps your project dependencies isolated.\n   - Create a new virtual environment: \n     ```bash\n     python3 -m venv myenv\n     ```\n   - Activate the virtual environment:\n     - On macOS or Linux:\n       ```bash\n       source myenv/bin/activate\n       ```\n     - On Windows:\n       ```bash\n       myenv\\Scripts\\activate\n       ```\n   - Once activated, you can install packages using `pip` without worrying about permissions:\n     ```bash\n     pip install <package>\n     ```\n\n2. **Install Packages System-wide Using `sudo`**: If you prefer to install packages system-wide and have the necessary permissions, you can use `sudo` to install packages:\n   ```bash\n   sudo pip3 install <package>\n   ```\n\n   However, this approach is generally not recommended because it can interfere with system packages and cause conflicts.\n\n3. **Use `--user` Flag**: If you want to install packages for your user only without virtual environments, you can use the `--user` flag:\n   ```bash\n   pip3 install --user <package>\n   ```\n\n   This will install the package to `~/Library/Python/3.7/lib/python/site-packages`, which should be accessible without needing root permissions.\n\n4. **Modify `PYTHONPATH`**: If you have installed packages using the `--user` flag but Python can't find them, you might need to modify your `PYTHONPATH` to include the user site-packages directory:\n   ```bash\n   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/Library/Python/3.7/lib/python/site-packages\n   ```\n\n5. **Check Python Version**: Ensure that the version of Python you are using to run your scripts is the same as the one where your packages are installed. You can check the version by running:\n   ```bash\n   python3 --version\n   pip3 --version\n   ```\n\nBy using virtual environments or the `--user` flag, you can typically avoid permission issues while keeping your Python environment organized and manageable."
