        "content": "In Python 2, strings are by default treated as byte strings (`str` type), whereas Unicode strings are explicitly defined using the `unicode` type. The `from __future__ import unicode_literals` statement changes this behavior by making all string literals in the module Unicode by default, similar to Python 3 behavior.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's happening in your code:\n\n1. **Without `unicode_literals`:**\n   - The string `name = 'hell\u00f3 w\u00f6rld from example'` is treated as a byte string (`str` type). It works because your terminal or environment is likely set up to handle the `utf-8` encoding, and the print statement outputs the byte string directly.\n\n2. **With `unicode_literals`:**\n   - The string `name = 'hell\u00f3 w\u00f6rld from example'` is treated as a Unicode string (`unicode` type). When you print it, Python 2 tries to implicitly encode the Unicode string to bytes using the default ASCII encoding, which causes the `UnicodeEncodeError` because the string contains non-ASCII characters.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can explicitly encode the Unicode string to a UTF-8 byte string before printing it. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\n# encoding: utf-8\nfrom __future__ import unicode_literals\nname = 'hell\u00f3 w\u00f6rld from example'\nprint(name.encode('utf-8'))\n```\n\nThis will convert the Unicode string to a UTF-8 encoded byte string, which should print correctly without causing a `UnicodeEncodeError`.\n\nAlternatively, if you are working in an environment that supports UTF-8 by default, you can set the default encoding to UTF-8 using the `sys` module, though this approach is generally discouraged as it can lead to inconsistencies:\n\n```python\n# encoding: utf-8\nfrom __future__ import unicode_literals\nimport sys\nreload(sys)\nsys.setdefaultencoding('utf-8')\n\nname = 'hell\u00f3 w\u00f6rld from example'\nprint(name)\n```\n\nHowever, the best practice is to always be explicit with encoding and decoding to maintain clarity and avoid unexpected errors."
