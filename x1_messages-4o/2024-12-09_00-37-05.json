I've tried using a dictionary like this: `mydict = {'funcList1': [foo(),bar(),goo()], 'funcList2': [foo(),goo(),bar()]}` but it doesn't seem to work. Is there a structure that can handle this functionality? I know I could use several `def` statements like: \n```python\ndef func1():\n    foo()\n    bar()\n    goo()\n```\nBut as the number of statements increases, it's becoming difficult to remember them all. I need a way to neatly store them in a dictionary so that I can inspect the keys whenever needed."

        "content": "Certainly! The issue you're encountering is due to calling the functions immediately when creating the dictionary. When you write `foo()`, `bar()`, or `goo()`, you're executing the functions immediately and storing their return values in the list, not the functions themselves.\n\nTo store the functions themselves (so they can be called later), you need to store references to the functions without the parentheses. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Define your functions\ndef foo():\n    print(\"foo was called\")\n\ndef bar():\n    print(\"bar was called\")\n\ndef goo():\n    print(\"goo was called\")\n\n# Store the functions in a dictionary as lists of function references\nmydict = {\n    'funcList1': [foo, bar, goo],\n    'funcList2': [foo, goo, bar]\n}\n\n# To call the functions from the dictionary, iterate over the list and call each function\ndef call_functions(key):\n    if key in mydict:\n        for func in mydict[key]:\n            func()  # Call each function\n    else:\n        print(\"Key not found in dictionary\")\n\n# Example usage\ncall_functions('funcList1')\n# Output:\n# foo was called\n# bar was called\n# goo was called\n\ncall_functions('funcList2')\n# Output:\n# foo was called\n# goo was called\n# bar was called\n```\n\nIn this setup, you store the function references in the dictionary and call them later by iterating over the list associated with the desired key. This approach makes it easy to see which functions are associated with which key and allows you to execute them in order when needed."
