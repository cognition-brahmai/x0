Can you provide a Ruby code for the sorting function that includes additional features for optimal performance? Additionally, can you also suggest a way to implement a tracking mechanism that counts the number of comparisons made during the sorting process for further analysis and performance evaluation?"

        "content": "Certainly! To implement an efficient quicksort algorithm in Ruby for sorting an array of integers in descending order, we'll need to consider edge cases such as empty arrays and arrays with duplicated elements. We'll also add a tracking mechanism to count the number of comparisons made during the sorting process.\n\nHere's a Ruby implementation:\n\n```ruby\nclass QuickSort\n  attr_reader :comparison_count\n\n  def initialize\n    @comparison_count = 0\n  end\n\n  def sort_descending(array)\n    quicksort(array, 0, array.length - 1)\n  end\n\n  private\n\n  def quicksort(array, low, high)\n    if low < high\n      pivot_index = partition(array, low, high)\n      quicksort(array, low, pivot_index - 1)\n      quicksort(array, pivot_index + 1, high)\n    end\n    array\n  end\n\n  def partition(array, low, high)\n    pivot = array[high]\n    i = low - 1\n\n    (low...high).each do |j|\n      @comparison_count += 1\n      if array[j] > pivot\n        i += 1\n        array[i], array[j] = array[j], array[i] # Swap elements\n      end\n    end\n\n    array[i + 1], array[high] = array[high], array[i + 1] # Swap pivot into correct position\n    i + 1\n  end\nend\n\n# Example usage\nsorter = QuickSort.new\narray = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]\nsorted_array = sorter.sort_descending(array)\nputs \"Sorted array: #{sorted_array}\"\nputs \"Number of comparisons: #{sorter.comparison_count}\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Class Structure**: The `QuickSort` class encapsulates the quicksort algorithm and tracks the number of comparisons.\n\n2. **Quicksort Method**: The `quicksort` method is recursive and sorts the array in-place. It takes the array along with `low` and `high` indices to manage the sorting range.\n\n3. **Partition Method**: This method partitions the array around a pivot element, which is chosen as the last element in the current range. It ensures elements greater than the pivot are on its left, facilitating descending order sorting.\n\n4. **Comparison Tracking**: The `@comparison_count` instance variable counts the number of comparisons made during the partitioning process for performance analysis.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**: The algorithm handles empty arrays and arrays with duplicate elements gracefully.\n\nThis implementation provides both sorting and insight into the algorithm's performance, which can be useful for further optimizations or analysis."
