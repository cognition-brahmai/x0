I've tried using `subprocess.call` but it doesn't allow me to get stdout, and `subprocess.Popen` doesn't wait for the command to finish. I'm also trying to avoid using `os.system` call. Here's the code I've tried so far:\n\n```python\nresult = subprocess.Popen([commands...,\n                        self.tmpfile.path()], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)\nout, err = result.communicate()\nprint out+\"HIHIHI\"\n```\nBut the output I'm getting is just \"HIHIHI\", without any stdout from the subprocess. Note that I am trying to run `wine` with this code."

        "content": "To run a subprocess in Python, wait for it to finish, and capture its standard output, you can use the `subprocess.run` function, which is available in Python 3.5 and later. This function is designed to handle these tasks more elegantly than `subprocess.Popen` when you need both waiting and output capture.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\n# Define your command as a list\ncommand = ['wine', 'your_executable', 'your_arguments', self.tmpfile.path()]\n\n# Run the command and capture the output\nresult = subprocess.run(command, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)\n\n# Access stdout and stderr\nstdout_output = result.stdout\nstderr_output = result.stderr\n\n# Print the output\nprint(stdout_output + \"HIHIHI\")\n\n# If needed, handle stderr as well\nif stderr_output:\n    print(\"Error:\", stderr_output)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **subprocess.run**: This function simplifies the process of starting a subprocess, waiting for it to complete, and obtaining its output.\n\n2. **stdout=subprocess.PIPE and stderr=subprocess.PIPE**: These parameters redirect the standard output and standard error to subprocess.PIPE, allowing you to capture them.\n\n3. **text=True**: This parameter ensures that the output is returned as a string rather than bytes, which is more convenient for string operations.\n\n4. **Command as a list**: It's a good practice to pass the command as a list of strings. This avoids issues related to shell interpretation and makes the code safer and more portable.\n\nThis approach should work well for running `wine` or any other command where you need to capture the output and error streams."
