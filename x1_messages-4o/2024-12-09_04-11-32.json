        "content": "In Python, you cannot directly use `yield` inside an `async` function because `async` functions are designed to work with `await` and asynchronous operations, while `yield` is used for creating generators that produce items one at a time. However, Python provides a way to use `yield` in an asynchronous context using `async` generators.\n\nTo use an `async` generator, you should use `yield` with `async` syntax, i.e., `yield` becomes `yield` in an `async` context. Also, when iterating over an `async` generator, you need to use `async for` instead of a regular `for` loop.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to work with `async` generators:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def createGenerator():\n    mylist = range(3)\n    for i in mylist:\n        await asyncio.sleep(1)\n        yield i * i  # Use yield in an async context\n\nasync def start():\n    async for i in createGenerator():  # Use async for to iterate\n        print(i)\n\nloop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n\ntry:\n    loop.run_until_complete(start())\n\nexcept KeyboardInterrupt:\n    loop.stop()\n```\n\nIn this revised version:\n\n- The `yield` expression is used within an `async` generator function, which makes `createGenerator` an `async` generator.\n- The `start` function uses `async for` to iterate over the items produced by the `async` generator.\n- This allows you to perform asynchronous operations (like `await asyncio.sleep(1)`) within the generator function."
