        "content": "To achieve the desired accuracy of at least 90% on both the training and testing sets using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with at least 3 hidden layers, you'll need to carefully design and train your neural network. Let's break this down step-by-step:\n\n### SQL Code to Create a Table\n\nFirst, let's write the SQL code to create a table in a database to store image pixel values and labels. Assuming each image is of size 64x64 pixels and is stored in grayscale (one channel), and labels are stored as integers:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE Images (\n    ImageID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    PixelValues BLOB, -- Binary Large Object to store image data\n    Label INT -- Integer label for the image class\n);\n```\n\nIn this table:\n- `ImageID` is a unique identifier for each image.\n- `PixelValues` stores the pixel data, which could be serialized into a blob.\n- `Label` stores the integer label representing the image class.\n\n### Python Code for Preprocessing the Images\n\nNext, we need to preprocess the images to ensure they are ready for training the neural network:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport cv2\nimport os\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\ndef load_and_preprocess_images(image_folder_path):\n    image_data = []\n    labels = []\n    \n    for label in os.listdir(image_folder_path):\n        label_path = os.path.join(image_folder_path, label)\n        for image_file in os.listdir(label_path):\n            image_path = os.path.join(label_path, image_file)\n            image = cv2.imread(image_path)\n            \n            # Convert to grayscale\n            gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\n            \n            # Resize image to 64x64\n            resized_image = cv2.resize(gray_image, (64, 64))\n            \n            # Normalize pixel values to range [0, 1]\n            normalized_image = resized_image / 255.0\n            \n            image_data.append(normalized_image)\n            labels.append(int(label))  # Assuming folder names are numeric labels\n    \n    X = np.array(image_data).reshape(-1, 64, 64, 1)  # Reshape for CNN input\n    y = np.array(labels)\n    \n    return train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\n# Example usage\nimage_folder_path = 'path_to_images'\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = load_and_preprocess_images(image_folder_path)\n```\n\n### Designing and Training the CNN\n\nYou would then design and train your CNN using a library like TensorFlow/Keras. Here's a simple example with 3 hidden layers:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense\n\n# Define the model\nmodel = Sequential([\n    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(64, 64, 1)),\n    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\n    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\n    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),\n    Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),\n    Flatten(),\n    Dense(128, activation='relu'),\n    Dense(10, activation='softmax')  # Assuming 10 classes\n])\n\n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))\n```\n\n### Transfer Learning\n\nTransfer learning involves using a pre-trained model and fine-tuning it for your specific task. This can improve performance, especially with a limited dataset. You could use a model like VGG16, ResNet, or others from a library like Keras, remove the top layers, and add your custom layers for classification. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import GlobalAveragePooling2D\n\n# Load VGG16 without the top layers\nbase_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(64, 64, 3))\n\n# Freeze the base model\nbase_model.trainable = False\n\n# Add custom layers\nmodel = Sequential([\n    base_model,\n    GlobalAveragePooling2D(),\n    Dense(128, activation='relu'),\n    Dense(10, activation='softmax')  # Assuming 10 classes\n])\n\n# Compile and train the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))\n```\n\nIn this transfer learning setup, you leverage the feature extraction capabilities of a pre-trained model, which can significantly boost performance and reduce training time."
