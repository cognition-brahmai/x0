I found a link that explains how to find the maximum values (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6910641/how-to-get-the-n-maximum-values-in-a-numpy-array), but I am unsure of how to adapt this for minimum values. The code they provided is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\narr = np.array([1, 3, 2, 4, 5])\n\narr.argsort()[-3:][::-1]\n```\n\nThis returns the array [4, 3, 1]. How can I modify this to find the minimum values instead?"

        "content": "To find the indices of the ten smallest values in a NumPy array, you can use a similar approach to the one used for finding the maximum values, but without reversing the order. The `argsort` function returns the indices that would sort the array. For the smallest values, you don't need to reverse the order after slicing. Here's how you can modify the code to achieve that:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Your array\narr = np.array([1, 3, 2, 4, 5])\n\n# Get indices of the ten smallest values\n# Use a smaller number if the array has fewer than ten elements\nnum_smallest = min(10, len(arr))\nindices_of_smallest = arr.argsort()[:num_smallest]\n\nprint(indices_of_smallest)\n```\n\nReplace `arr` with your actual array. This code will give you the indices of the ten smallest values. If your array has fewer than ten elements, it will return indices for all elements in the array."
