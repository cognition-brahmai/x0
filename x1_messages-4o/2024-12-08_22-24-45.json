        "content": "A drugstore, also known as a pharmacy or chemist, is a retail establishment that primarily sells medications, both prescription and over-the-counter, along with various health and wellness products. In addition to pharmaceuticals, drugstores often offer a range of personal care items, such as skincare and hair care products, cosmetics, and hygiene products. Many drugstores also provide health-related services including immunizations, health screenings, and consultations with pharmacists.\n\nSome drugstores may also carry a selection of household goods, snacks, and beverages, making them convenient one-stop shops for various everyday needs. They are typically staffed by licensed pharmacists and pharmacy technicians who are trained to dispense medications safely, provide advice on drug interactions and side effects, and offer guidance on managing health conditions. Drugstores can be standalone locations or part of larger retail chains, and many offer online services for prescription refills and home delivery."
