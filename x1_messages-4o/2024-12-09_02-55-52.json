        "content": "To extract page sizes from a PDF in Python, you can use the `PyPDF2` library, which is a more recent and maintained version of the `pyPdf` library. Additionally, you may want to consider using `pdfplumber` or `pdfminer` for more advanced PDF processing tasks. Below is an example using `PyPDF2` to extract page sizes:\n\nFirst, ensure you have `PyPDF2` installed. You can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install PyPDF2\n```\n\nHere's a Python script that uses `PyPDF2` to extract and print the page sizes from a PDF:\n\n```python\nimport PyPDF2\n\ndef get_pdf_page_sizes(file_path):\n    # Open the PDF file\n    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:\n        reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)\n        \n        # Iterate through each page to get the size\n        for page_number, page in enumerate(reader.pages):\n            media_box = page.mediabox\n            width = media_box.width\n            height = media_box.height\n            print(f\"Page {page_number + 1}: Width = {width}, Height = {height}\")\n\n# Example usage\nget_pdf_page_sizes('your_file.pdf')\n```\n\nThis script opens the PDF file, reads each page, and retrieves the media box dimensions which represent the size of the page in points (1 point = 1/72 inches).\n\nIf you are open to using a newer version of Python, it\u2019s recommended to upgrade to Python 3.x for better support and compatibility with libraries.\n\nPlease note that if your PDF contains scanned images or if you are looking for more detailed image processing within PDFs, you might need to consider using a combination of tools such as `pdf2image` for converting PDF pages to images and then using `PIL/Pillow` for further processing.\n\nIf you encounter any issues with specific PDFs or need more advanced features, feel free to ask for further assistance!"
