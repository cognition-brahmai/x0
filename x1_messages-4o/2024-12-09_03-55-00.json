I have a table of data with a few fields and less than a hundred rows, and I need this data to be persistent, so I save it as a CSV and load it on start-up. I have considered using a database, but it seems like an overkill for my needs. The data looks like this:\n\n```\nRow  | Name     | Year   | Priority\n------------------------------------\n1    | Cat      | 1998   | 1\n2    | Fish     | 1998   | 2\n3    | Dog      | 1999   | 1 \n4    | Aardvark | 2000   | 1\n5    | Wallaby  | 2000   | 1\n6    | Zebra    | 2001   | 3\n```\nI need to be able to look up a row based on either ID or name, display the table in different orders based on multiple fields, and count instances based on sets of parameters. I've considered using list of row lists, list of column lists, dictionary of columns lists, and dictionary with keys being tuples of (Row, Field). What would be the recommended approach, considering that performance is not a major issue for me?"

        "content": "For your use case, where performance is not a major concern and the dataset is relatively small, you can benefit from using a simple and flexible data structure that allows easy manipulation and querying. Here are a couple of recommended approaches:\n\n### 1. List of Dictionaries\n\nUsing a list of dictionaries is a straightforward approach that offers clarity and ease of access. Each row can be represented as a dictionary, where the keys are the column names. This structure allows you to easily look up, sort, and filter data.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\ndata = [\n    {\"Row\": 1, \"Name\": \"Cat\", \"Year\": 1998, \"Priority\": 1},\n    {\"Row\": 2, \"Name\": \"Fish\", \"Year\": 1998, \"Priority\": 2},\n    {\"Row\": 3, \"Name\": \"Dog\", \"Year\": 1999, \"Priority\": 1},\n    {\"Row\": 4, \"Name\": \"Aardvark\", \"Year\": 2000, \"Priority\": 1},\n    {\"Row\": 5, \"Name\": \"Wallaby\", \"Year\": 2000, \"Priority\": 1},\n    {\"Row\": 6, \"Name\": \"Zebra\", \"Year\": 2001, \"Priority\": 3}\n]\n```\n\nOperations such as looking up a row by name or ID, sorting, and filtering can be done using list comprehensions and Python's built-in functions like `sorted()`, `filter()`, etc.\n\n### 2. Pandas DataFrame\n\nIf you prefer more functionality for data manipulation, especially if you might later want to perform more complex operations or analyses, using a Pandas DataFrame is an excellent choice. Even though the dataset is small, Pandas provides a rich set of features to easily manipulate tabular data.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndata = pd.DataFrame([\n    {\"Row\": 1, \"Name\": \"Cat\", \"Year\": 1998, \"Priority\": 1},\n    {\"Row\": 2, \"Name\": \"Fish\", \"Year\": 1998, \"Priority\": 2},\n    {\"Row\": 3, \"Name\": \"Dog\", \"Year\": 1999, \"Priority\": 1},\n    {\"Row\": 4, \"Name\": \"Aardvark\", \"Year\": 2000, \"Priority\": 1},\n    {\"Row\": 5, \"Name\": \"Wallaby\", \"Year\": 2000, \"Priority\": 1},\n    {\"Row\": 6, \"Name\": \"Zebra\", \"Year\": 2001, \"Priority\": 3}\n])\n\n# Example operations\nrow_lookup = data[data['Row'] == 1]\nname_lookup = data[data['Name'] == 'Dog']\nsorted_data = data.sort_values(by='Year')\n```\n\n### Considerations:\n- **List of Dictionaries**: Simplicity and native Python functionality. Suitable for quick and simple tasks.\n- **Pandas DataFrame**: More powerful for data manipulation and analysis with built-in functions for filtering, grouping, and aggregating.\n\nBoth methods would be suitable for your requirements, and the choice largely depends on your preference and any potential future needs for data operations. If you lean towards simplicity and pure Python, go with a list of dictionaries. If you want to leverage more advanced data handling capacities, Pandas would be the way to go."
