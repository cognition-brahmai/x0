        "content": "The error message you're encountering indicates that the `pg_config` executable, which is necessary for building the `psycopg` package, isn't found in your system's PATH. This executable is typically part of the PostgreSQL development package, which you need to have installed on your system.\n\nHere's how you can resolve the issue on your Mac:\n\n1. **Install PostgreSQL**: First, ensure that PostgreSQL is installed on your system. You can do this using Homebrew, which is a popular package manager for macOS. If you don't have Homebrew installed, you can install it by running this command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n   ```\n\n   Once Homebrew is installed, you can install PostgreSQL with:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew install postgresql\n   ```\n\n2. **Locate `pg_config`**: After installing PostgreSQL, `pg_config` should be available in your system's PATH. You can verify its location by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   which pg_config\n   ```\n\n3. **Add to PATH if necessary**: If `pg_config` is not found, you might need to add its directory to your PATH. Usually, Homebrew installs it in `/usr/local/bin`, which should already be in your PATH. If it's not, you can add it by modifying your shell's configuration file (e.g., `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, etc.):\n\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=\"/usr/local/bin:$PATH\"\n   ```\n\n   After editing the file, reload your shell configuration with:\n\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bash_profile\n   ```\n\n   or\n\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.zshrc\n   ```\n\n   depending on your shell.\n\n4. **Install `psycopg` again**: Now that `pg_config` is in your PATH, try installing `psycopg` again:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install psycopg\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully install the `psycopg` package in your virtual environment. If you continue to encounter issues, make sure that no other PostgreSQL installations are conflicting with your current setup."
