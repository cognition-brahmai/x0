        "content": "In Python, a closure is a function that retains access to the variables from its containing (enclosing) scope. This allows you to create a pair of functions to read and set a value by taking advantage of the closure property. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can achieve this:\n\n1. Define an outer function that will encapsulate the value you want to read and set.\n2. Inside the outer function, define two inner functions: one for reading the value and another for setting it.\n3. Return both inner functions from the outer function.\n\nHere\u2019s an example:\n\n```python\ndef value_manager(initial_value=None):\n    value = initial_value\n    \n    def get_value():\n        \"\"\"Returns the current value.\"\"\"\n        return value\n    \n    def set_value(new_value):\n        \"\"\"Sets a new value.\"\"\"\n        nonlocal value\n        value = new_value\n    \n    return get_value, set_value\n\n# Usage\nget_val, set_val = value_manager(42)\n\nprint(get_val())  # Output: 42\nset_val(100)\nprint(get_val())  # Output: 100\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Outer Function (`value_manager`)**: This is where the encapsulation happens. It initializes the `value` with `initial_value`.\n- **Inner Functions (`get_value` and `set_value`)**: \n  - `get_value` simply returns the current value.\n  - `set_value` uses the `nonlocal` keyword to modify the `value` variable from the enclosing scope, allowing you to update its value.\n- The outer function returns a tuple containing the `get_value` and `set_value` functions, allowing you to call them as needed.\n\nThis pattern effectively creates a closure because both `get_value` and `set_value` retain access to the `value` variable even after the `value_manager` function has finished executing."
