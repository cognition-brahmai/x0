For example, I have the following numpy array:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])\n```\nAnd I want to remove the elements `3,4,7` from this array. I know the indices of these values which are `index=[2,3,6]`."

This function allows you to specify the indices of the elements you want to remove. Here's how you can do it for your example:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])\nindices_to_remove = [2, 3, 6]\n\n# Use np.delete to remove the specified indices\na_modified = np.delete(a, indices_to_remove)\n\nprint(a_modified)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n[1 2 5 6 8 9]\n```\n\nThe elements at indices `2`, `3`, and `6` have been removed from the original array."
