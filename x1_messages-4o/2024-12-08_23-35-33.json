However, after a few months, a cybercriminal was able to break the encryption and gain access to the company's sensitive data. The IT department then hired a data security expert to fix the issue. After a week of work, the expert claimed that the encryption was now impenetrable and submitted a bill for their services. The company's CFO was surprised by the bill amount and asked for an explanation. The expert replied, \"I charged $50 for each bit of data that I secured.\" The CFO was confused and asked, \"But how many bits did you secure?\" The expert replied with a smile, \"That's a XOR secret.\" \nWhat is the total amount charged by the expert to secure the data, given that the company had 1000 bytes of data in the database and the expert charged $50 for each bit of data secured through XOR encryption?"
