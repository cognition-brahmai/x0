        "content": "To simulate the process of randomly selecting two chocolates from a box of 12 with different flavors in Swift, and to calculate the probability of getting one milk chocolate and one dark chocolate, you can use the following approach. First, let's break it down:\n\n1. **Setup the chocolates**: You have 4 milk chocolates, 3 dark chocolates, and 5 white chocolates.\n2. **Simulate the selection**: Randomly choose two chocolates from the box.\n3. **Calculate the probability**: Specifically, calculate the probability of selecting one milk chocolate and one dark chocolate.\n\nHere's a Swift code example that does this:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nfunc simulateChocolateSelection() {\n    let chocolates = [\"Milk\", \"Milk\", \"Milk\", \"Milk\",\n                      \"Dark\", \"Dark\", \"Dark\",\n                      \"White\", \"White\", \"White\", \"White\", \"White\"]\n\n    var milkAndDarkCount = 0\n    let simulations = 100000\n\n    for _ in 0..<simulations {\n        // Shuffle the array to randomly select chocolates\n        let shuffledChocolates = chocolates.shuffled()\n\n        // Pick the first two chocolates from the shuffled array\n        let firstChocolate = shuffledChocolates[0]\n        let secondChocolate = shuffledChocolates[1]\n\n        // Check if one is milk and the other is dark\n        if (firstChocolate == \"Milk\" && secondChocolate == \"Dark\") ||\n           (firstChocolate == \"Dark\" && secondChocolate == \"Milk\") {\n            milkAndDarkCount += 1\n        }\n    }\n\n    let probability = Double(milkAndDarkCount) / Double(simulations)\n    print(\"Probability of selecting one milk chocolate and one dark chocolate: \\(probability)\")\n}\n\nsimulateChocolateSelection()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Setup**: We represent each chocolate by a string in an array. The array `chocolates` contains 4 \"Milk\", 3 \"Dark\", and 5 \"White\" strings.\n2. **Simulation**: We perform a large number of simulations (100,000 in this example) to approximate the probability. In each simulation, we shuffle the chocolates and pick the first two.\n3. **Counting**: We count how many times one chocolate is \"Milk\" and the other is \"Dark\".\n4. **Probability Calculation**: The probability is computed by dividing the count of successful outcomes by the total number of simulations.\n\nThis code provides an approximation of the probability using a Monte Carlo simulation. The more simulations you run, the closer the estimate will be to the actual probability."
