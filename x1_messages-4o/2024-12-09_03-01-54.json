These packets are Python bytes objects and I'd like to read them using a \"read(n_bytes)\" method. At the moment, my code looks like this:\n\n```python\npacket = b'abcd'\nsome_value = packet[0:2]\nother_value = packet[2:4]\n```\n\nBut what I'd like to do is to create a readable stream from a bytes object, like so:\n\n```python\npacket = b'abcd'\nsome_value = packet.read(2)\nother_value = packet.read(2)\n```\n\nHow can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To achieve the functionality of reading from a bytes object using a `read(n_bytes)` method, you can use Python's built-in `io.BytesIO` class. This class provides a file-like object for reading and writing bytes, which will allow you to use the `read()` method as you desire. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport io\n\n# Your bytes object\npacket = b'abcd'\n\n# Create a BytesIO stream from the bytes object\npacket_stream = io.BytesIO(packet)\n\n# Use the read method to read n bytes\nsome_value = packet_stream.read(2)\nother_value = packet_stream.read(2)\n\nprint(some_value)  # Output: b'ab'\nprint(other_value)  # Output: b'cd'\n```\n\nIn this example, `io.BytesIO` allows you to treat the `packet` bytes object like a file, enabling you to use the `read()` method to read a specified number of bytes. This is particularly useful when you want to process byte streams in a sequential manner."
