Even though I have tried several backends and have the antialiasing flag of the lines set, I can still see some aliasing in my data. I'm using matplotlib version 1.01 on Windows 7. Here is a simple example of the code I'm working with:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib\nmatplotlib.use('wxAgg')\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as pl\nprint 'Backend:', pl.get_backend()\n\nx = np.linspace(0,6,100)\ny = np.sin(x)\n\nfor a in range(10):\n    pl.plot( x, a/10.*x, linewidth=1)\n\npl.show()\n```\n\nThis code produces a plot with noticeable aliasing, especially in the lower red curve. Is there a way to improve this?"

        "content": "To improve the antialiasing in your matplotlib plots, there are a few strategies you can try, especially given the older version of matplotlib you are using (1.0.1). Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Upgrade Matplotlib**: First, if possible, consider upgrading to a newer version of matplotlib. Antialiasing and rendering improvements have been made over the years, and using a more recent version could automatically give you better results.\n\n2. **Change Backend**: While you are using `'wxAgg'`, you might want to try other backends like `'Qt5Agg'`, `'TkAgg'`, or `'Agg'`. Different backends can have different rendering characteristics and might handle antialiasing better.\n\n3. **Increase DPI**: You can increase the DPI (dots per inch) of your plot, which can improve the visual quality. You can set this when you create your figure:\n   ```python\n   fig = pl.figure(dpi=200)  # Increase DPI\n   ```\n\n4. **Adjust Antialiasing Settings**: Make sure antialiasing is enabled for the plot lines:\n   ```python\n   pl.plot(x, a/10.*x, linewidth=1, antialiased=True)\n   ```\n\n5. **Use Vector Graphics for Saving**: If the aliasing is primarily an issue when saving the plot, try saving it as a vector graphic (like SVG or PDF) which inherently supports better antialiasing:\n   ```python\n   pl.savefig('plot.svg')  # or 'plot.pdf'\n   ```\n\n6. **Smoothing Techniques**: As a last resort, you can apply some form of post-processing smoothing to the image using image editing software or a library like PIL (Pillow) in Python.\n\nHere's an updated version of your code with some of these suggestions:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib\nmatplotlib.use('Agg')  # Try a different backend if possible\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as pl\n\nprint('Backend:', pl.get_backend())\n\nx = np.linspace(0, 6, 100)\ny = np.sin(x)\n\nfig, ax = pl.subplots(dpi=200)  # Increase DPI for better quality\n\nfor a in range(10):\n    ax.plot(x, a/10.*x, linewidth=1, antialiased=True)\n\npl.show()\n```\n\nTry these suggestions and see if they help improve the appearance of your plots."
