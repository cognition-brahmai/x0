        "content": "Yes, Python provides a built-in module called `os.path` which includes a function called `splitext()` that you can use to extract the extension from a filename. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nfilename = \"example.txt\"\nname, extension = os.path.splitext(filename)\n\nprint(\"Filename:\", name)\nprint(\"Extension:\", extension)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `splitext()` function splits the filename into two parts: the name and the extension. The extension includes the period (`.`) as well. If you want just the extension without the period, you can modify the code slightly:\n\n```python\nextension = os.path.splitext(filename)[1][1:]\nprint(\"Extension without period:\", extension)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nExtension without period: txt\n```\n\nThis method is straightforward and handles most cases well."
