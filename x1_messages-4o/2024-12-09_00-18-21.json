        "content": "The issue you're encountering is likely due to the recursion depth being exceeded, even after increasing the recursion limit. Here are a few steps you can take to address the problem:\n\n1. **Optimize the Recursive Function**:\n   - Review your recursive function to ensure it is optimized and not making unnecessary recursive calls. Sometimes restructuring the logic can significantly reduce the depth of recursion required.\n\n2. **Use Iterative Approach**:\n   - Consider rewriting the algorithm using an iterative approach. This can often help avoid deep recursion and stack overflow issues. You can use a stack data structure to simulate recursion iteratively.\n\n3. **Break Down the Graph**:\n   - If possible, try breaking down the graph into smaller subgraphs, find Eulerian paths for these, and then combine them. This might help reduce the depth of recursion needed at any one time.\n\n4. **Profile and Debug**:\n   - Use Python\u2019s profiling tools to understand which parts of your code are consuming the most resources. You can use the `cProfile` module for this. It might give insights into how you can optimize the recursive function or whether there are any redundant calls.\n\n5. **Increase Stack Size**:\n   - Increasing the stack size might be beneficial, but it can be risky as it might lead to instability if not handled properly. You can increase the stack size by using the `resource` module on Unix-based systems, but for Windows, this is more complex and usually not recommended.\n\n6. **Check for Infinite Loops**:\n   - Ensure there are no conditions that could lead to infinite recursion. Double-check the base case and recursive step conditions.\n\n7. **Use Depth-First Search (DFS) Iteratively**:\n   - Since Eulerian path problems are often solved with DFS, consider implementing DFS iteratively using an explicit stack data structure.\n\nHere's a general idea of how you might implement an iterative DFS for Eulerian Path:\n\n```python\ndef find_eulerian_path(graph):\n    stack = []\n    path = []\n    # Start from any vertex with an odd degree, or any vertex if all degrees are even\n    start_vertex = next(iter(graph))\n    \n    stack.append(start_vertex)\n    while stack:\n        vertex = stack[-1]\n        if graph[vertex]:\n            next_vertex = graph[vertex].pop()\n            stack.append(next_vertex)\n        else:\n            path.append(stack.pop())\n    \n    return path[::-1]  # Reverse the path to get the correct order\n\n# Example graph representation\ngraph = {\n    'A': ['B', 'C'],\n    'B': ['A', 'D'],\n    'C': ['A', 'D'],\n    'D': ['B', 'C']\n}\n\nprint(find_eulerian_path(graph))\n```\n\nThis is a basic iterative approach to finding an Eulerian Path. Depending on your graph's representation and requirements, you may need to adjust this implementation."
