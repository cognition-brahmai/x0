Below is a Python code that counts the frequency of each character in a given string while excluding punctuation marks and digits:\n\n```python\nimport string\n\ndef count_character_frequency(input_string, exclude_chars=None):\n    if exclude_chars is None:\n        exclude_chars = set(string.punctuation + string.digits)\n    \n    # Initialize a dictionary to store the frequency of each character\n    frequency = {}\n    \n    for char in input_string:\n        if char not in exclude_chars:\n            if char in frequency:\n                frequency[char] += 1\n            else:\n                frequency[char] = 1\n    \n    return frequency\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_string = \"Hello, World! 123\"\nfrequency = count_character_frequency(input_string)\nprint(frequency)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Exclude Characters**: The `exclude_chars` is a set of characters that should be excluded from the count. By default, it includes all punctuation marks and digits using `string.punctuation` and `string.digits`.\n\n2. **Frequency Dictionary**: It uses a dictionary `frequency` to store the count of each character.\n\n3. **Iterating Through the String**: It iterates through each character in the `input_string`, checks if it's not in the `exclude_chars` set, and updates the frequency count.\n\n4. **Example Usage**: The code provides an example using the string \"Hello, World! 123\". It counts the frequency of each character, excluding punctuation and digits, and prints the result.\n\nFeel free to modify `exclude_chars` if you want to exclude additional characters or change the behavior."
