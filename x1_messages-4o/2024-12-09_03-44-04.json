However, what if I want to sort only a part of the list, while still keeping it in place? In C++, this can be achieved as follows:\n\n```c++\nint array = { 4, 8, 1, 7, 3, 0, 5, 2, 6, 9 };\nint * ptr = array;\nstd::sort( ptr + 1, ptr + 4 );\n```\n\nIs there a similar way to do this in Python?"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve a similar effect in Python by using slicing and the built-in `sorted()` function, which returns a new sorted list from the specified range, and then you can assign it back to that part of the list. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\na = [4, 8, 1, 7, 3, 0, 5, 2, 6, 9]\n\n# Sort only the part of the list from index 1 to 4 (exclusive)\na[1:4] = sorted(a[1:4])\n\nprint(a)\n```\n\nIn this example, `a[1:4]` selects the sublist `[8, 1, 7]`, and `sorted(a[1:4])` sorts this sublist to `[1, 7, 8]`. The sorted sublist is then assigned back to the slice `a[1:4]`, resulting in the list `[4, 1, 7, 8, 3, 0, 5, 2, 6, 9]`. This method modifies the original list in place, similar to the C++ example you provided."
