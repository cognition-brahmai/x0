Use the present perfect tense structure: \"has/have + past participle of the main verb.\"\n3. Ensure the subject-verb agreement: use \"has\" for third-person singular subjects (he, she, it) and \"have\" for all other subjects (I, you, we, they).\n4. Retain the rest of the sentence structure as it is, making adjustments only if necessary for grammatical consistency.\n\nExample:\nOriginal Sentence: \"She eats breakfast.\"\nPresent Perfect Tense: \"She has eaten breakfast.\""
