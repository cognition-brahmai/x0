        "content": "In SQLAlchemy, you can obtain the next value of an auto-incrementing primary key without committing by using the `RETURNING` clause (if your database supports it) or by using a separate transaction to perform the insert and then roll it back. However, this approach can be complex and is not typically recommended due to potential concurrency issues.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this using a transaction:\n\n1. **Using `RETURNING`:** If your database supports the `RETURNING` clause (such as PostgreSQL), you can perform an insert operation and retrieve the primary key immediately.\n\n2. **Using a separate transaction:** Begin a transaction, perform an insert, capture the primary key, and then roll back the transaction. Note that this approach means the primary key value you get won't be guaranteed for future use, especially in a high-concurrency environment.\n\nFor executing two operations inside a transaction where one depends on the primary key assigned in the previous operation, you can use SQLAlchemy's session and transaction management features.\n\nHere's a step-by-step example:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, Sequence\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\n\nBase = declarative_base()\n\nclass MyTable(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'my_table'\n    id = Column(Integer, Sequence('my_table_id_seq'), primary_key=True)\n    name = Column(String)\n\n# Set up the database engine and session\nengine = create_engine('your_database_url')\nSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\nsession = Session()\n\n# Start a transaction\ntry:\n    # First operation: insert a new record and commit to get the primary key\n    new_record = MyTable(name='First Record')\n    session.add(new_record)\n    session.flush()  # Flush to get the primary key\n\n    # Now you can access the primary key without committing\n    primary_key = new_record.id\n\n    # Second operation: use the primary key for another operation\n    another_record = MyTable(id=primary_key + 1, name='Dependent Record')\n    session.add(another_record)\n\n    # Commit the transaction to persist changes\n    session.commit()\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n    # Rollback in case of an error\n    session.rollback()\n    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\nfinally:\n    # Close the session\n    session.close()\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- We start a transaction by adding a new record and flushing the session, which allows us to obtain the primary key assigned to `new_record`.\n- We use this primary key in a dependent operation.\n- We commit the transaction to persist all changes. If any error occurs during the process, we roll back the transaction to ensure data integrity.\n\nThis approach ensures that both operations are atomic and dependent on the primary key obtained in the first operation."
