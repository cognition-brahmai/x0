When run from my distribution, I want my distributed packages to take precedence over those default ones. Based on my understanding, the 'PYTHONPATH' should be the first thing added to 'sys.path' after the current directory. However, I've observed that all folders defined in '$site-packages$/easy-install.pth' take precedence over this. Can someone provide a detailed explanation of this import order and suggest a way to set the environmental variables such that the packages I distribute take precedence over the default installed ones? My current attempt in setting the 'PYTHONPATH' is as follows:\n```\nos.environ['PYTHONPATH'] = DATA_PATH + ':'\nos.environ['PYTHONPATH'] = os.environ['PYTHONPATH'] + os.path.join(DATA_PATH, 'lib') + ':'\nos.environ['PYTHONPATH'] = os.environ['PYTHONPATH'] + os.path.join(\n                            DATA_PATH, 'lib', 'python2.7', 'site-packages') + ':'\nos.environ['PYTHONPATH'] = os.environ['PYTHONPATH'] + os.path.join(\n                          DATA_PATH, 'lib', 'python2.7', 'site-packages.zip')\n```\nThis works fine on a machine that doesn't have Python installed. However, when Python distribution is already present, its site-packages take precedence. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "To ensure that your distributed packages take precedence over those installed in the user's site-packages, you need to manipulate the `sys.path` directly in your application, rather than relying solely on the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable. The `sys.path` list determines the order in which Python looks for modules to import, and by modifying it, you can control which packages are found first.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Modify `sys.path` Directly:**\n   You can modify `sys.path` at runtime in your application's entry point (e.g., the main script). Insert your package paths at the beginning of `sys.path` to give them higher precedence:\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   import os\n\n   # Paths to your distributed packages\n   data_path = '/path/to/DATA_PATH'\n   lib_path = os.path.join(data_path, 'lib')\n   site_packages_path = os.path.join(data_path, 'lib', 'python2.7', 'site-packages')\n   site_packages_zip_path = os.path.join(data_path, 'lib', 'python2.7', 'site-packages.zip')\n\n   # Insert your paths at the beginning of sys.path\n   sys.path.insert(0, site_packages_zip_path)\n   sys.path.insert(0, site_packages_path)\n   sys.path.insert(0, lib_path)\n   sys.path.insert(0, data_path)\n   ```\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Order:**\n   By inserting your paths at the beginning of `sys.path`, you ensure that Python looks in these directories first before checking other locations like the user's site-packages.\n\n3. **Use a Virtual Environment:**\n   If possible, consider using a virtual environment for your application. Virtual environments isolate dependencies and can prevent conflicts with system-wide packages. You can distribute your application with a pre-configured virtual environment or provide instructions for users to create one.\n\n4. **Bundling with py2app/py2exe:**\n   When packaging your application with tools like py2app or py2exe, ensure that your application's dependencies are bundled within the package itself. This makes it more portable and reduces reliance on external packages.\n\n5. **Testing:**\n   Always test your application on different systems, including those with varying Python installations, to ensure that your package paths are properly prioritized.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to ensure that your distributed packages have precedence over the default ones in the user's Python installation."
