I am using the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn import preprocessing\nmin_max_scaler = preprocessing.MinMaxScaler()\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'A':[1,2,3,7,9,15,16,1,5,6,2,4,8,9],'B':[15,12,10,11,8,14,17,20,4,12,4,5,17,19],'C':['Y','Y','Y','Y','N','N','N','Y','N','Y','N','N','Y','Y']})\n\ndf[['A','B']] = min_max_scaler.fit_transform(df[['A','B']])\ndf['C'] = df['C'].apply(lambda x: 0 if x.strip()=='N' else 1)\n```\nI then train and test a model with `A` and `B` as features and `C` as the label. However, I am confused about how to handle new data when using normalization. For instance, when I have a new dataset:\n\n```python\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'A':[25,67,24,76,23],'B':[2,54,22,75,19]})\n```\nIf I apply the normalization to this new data, the values are changed according to the new data and not based on the original training data. This is how I am normalizing the new data:\n\n```python\ndata[['A','B']] = min_max_scaler.fit_transform(data[['A','B']])\n```\nNow, the values of `A` and `B` are transformed based on the max and min values of the new dataset. This seems to make the prediction invalid because the normalization is not consistent between the training and testing data. How can I correctly normalize new data for prediction?"

        "content": "When you're using MinMaxScaler for normalization, it's important to ensure that the scaling parameters (min and max values) are consistent between your training and new data. The typical approach is to fit the MinMaxScaler on your training data and then use the same scaler to transform both your training and new datasets. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Fit the scaler on the training data**: This will calculate the min and max values based on the training data.\n2. **Transform the training data**: Use the scaler to transform the training data.\n3. **Transform the new data**: Use the same fitted scaler to transform any new data.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to follow these steps:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn import preprocessing\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create your training data\ntrain_df = pd.DataFrame({'A':[1,2,3,7,9,15,16,1,5,6,2,4,8,9],\n                         'B':[15,12,10,11,8,14,17,20,4,12,4,5,17,19],\n                         'C':['Y','Y','Y','Y','N','N','N','Y','N','Y','N','N','Y','Y']})\n\n# Initialize the MinMaxScaler\nmin_max_scaler = preprocessing.MinMaxScaler()\n\n# Fit the scaler on the training features\nmin_max_scaler.fit(train_df[['A', 'B']])\n\n# Transform the training data\ntrain_df[['A', 'B']] = min_max_scaler.transform(train_df[['A', 'B']])\ntrain_df['C'] = train_df['C'].apply(lambda x: 0 if x.strip() == 'N' else 1)\n\n# Create new data\nnew_data = pd.DataFrame({'A':[25,67,24,76,23],\n                         'B':[2,54,22,75,19]})\n\n# Use the same fitted scaler to transform the new data\nnew_data[['A', 'B']] = min_max_scaler.transform(new_data[['A', 'B']])\n\n# Now `new_data` has been normalized using the same parameters as the training data\n```\n\nBy fitting the `MinMaxScaler` on the training data and then using it to transform both the training and new data, you ensure that the scaling is consistent. This allows you to make valid predictions on the new data using the model trained on the normalized training data."
