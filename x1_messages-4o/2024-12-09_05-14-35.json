Each time I try to log in, I am redirected back to the login page without any error messages. I have checked the Django FAQ but couldn't find a solution. I am using Django 1.4 on Ubuntu 12.04 with Apache2 and modwsgi. I have confirmed that I am registering the admin in the admin.py file and have synced the database after adding INSTALLED_APPS. I can verify that my admin user is being authenticated because when I enter a wrong password, an error message is displayed. However, I can't proceed to the admin page. I have tried setting SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN to the machine's IP and None, and I have confirmed that the cookie domain shows as the machine's IP in Chrome. I have also checked that the user authenticates via the shell. I have tried logging in using IE8 and Chrome Canary, but both attempts result in the same issue. I have shared my settings.py, urls.py, Apache version, Apache apache2/sites-available/default configurations for reference. When using the development server via runserver, the admin page does proceed so it seems the issue lies with wsgi/apache. What could be the problem?"

        "content": "It sounds like you're encountering a session-related issue with Django when using Apache and mod_wsgi. Here are a few steps and considerations that might help you resolve this problem:\n\n1. **Session Cookie Path and Domain:**\n   - Make sure that the `SESSION_COOKIE_PATH` in your Django settings is set correctly. If it's not set, Django uses `'/'` by default, which should work, but it's good to verify.\n   - You said you've experimented with `SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN`. Try setting it to `None` if you haven't already, as this usually allows the cookie to work correctly across subdomains.\n\n2. **CSRF and Session Middleware:**\n   - Ensure that `django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware` and `django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware` are included in your `MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES` (or `MIDDLEWARE` in newer versions). The order of these middlewares matters; typically, `SessionMiddleware` should be before `CsrfViewMiddleware`.\n\n3. **Correct WSGI Configuration:**\n   - Double-check your WSGI file configuration. Ensure that it points to the correct settings module and that the Python paths are correctly set up.\n   - Make sure the WSGI script has the correct permissions and is executable by the web server.\n\n4. **Apache Configuration:**\n   - Ensure that the `WSGIPythonPath` in your Apache configuration points to the correct virtual environment or Python path where Django is installed.\n   - Verify that the `WSGIScriptAlias` is correctly pointing to your WSGI application. The path should be absolute.\n\n5. **Debugging:**\n   - Check Apache error logs for any clues. Sometimes, issues with permissions or paths can manifest silently in the web application but will be logged in Apache\u2019s error logs.\n   - Enable Django's debug mode temporarily to see if any additional errors or warnings are displayed.\n\n6. **Database and Caching:**\n   - Ensure that the database is correctly synced (though you mentioned you've done this).\n   - Check if caching (if used) is causing issues with session handling. Sometimes, cache backends can interfere with session persistence.\n\n7. **Session Backend:**\n   - Try using a different session backend to see if the problem persists. For example, switch to database-backed sessions or file-based sessions to test.\n\n8. **Browser and Cookies:**\n   - Clear your browser\u2019s cookies and cache to make sure there\u2019s no stale session data interfering with the login process.\n\n9. **Virtual Host and HTTPS:**\n   - If you are using HTTPS, make sure `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` is set correctly (usually `True` for HTTPS).\n   - Ensure that the virtual host configuration in Apache is correctly set up, especially if you are using subdomains or different ports.\n\nBy systematically going through these steps, you should be able to narrow down the issue. If the problem persists, consider upgrading Django, as Django 1.4 is quite old and many improvements have been made in newer versions."
