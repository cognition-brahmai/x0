I am using `json.loads(data)` to parse it but I keep encountering the following exception: `ValueError: Expecting property name enclosed in double quotes: line 1 column 2 (char 1)`. I have tried to find solutions online but none of them seem to work, except `json.loads(json.dumps(data))` which I find inefficient as it accepts any kind of data, even those not in JSON format. Could you suggest a more efficient way to solve this problem?\n\nJSON Data:\n```\n{'http://example.org/about': {'http://purl.org/dc/terms/title': [{'type': 'literal', 'value': \"Anna's Homepage\"}]}}\n```\nException:\n```\nValueError: Expecting property name enclosed in double quotes: line 1 column 2 (char 1)\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that the JSON data you're trying to parse is using single quotes (`'`) instead of double quotes (`\"`). According to the JSON standard, property names and string values must be enclosed in double quotes.\n\nHere's how you can handle this more efficiently:\n\n1. **Convert Single Quotes to Double Quotes**: Before using `json.loads()`, you can replace single quotes with double quotes. This is a quick fix and should work if you're sure the data is otherwise a valid JSON string.\n\n2. **Use a JSON Library**: If you have control over the format of the JSON being sent, ensure it's correctly formatted with double quotes. If not, you can manually convert it or utilize regex to replace the single quotes.\n\nHere's a Python example using a simple replacement approach:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Example data as received, with single quotes\ndata = \"{'http://example.org/about': {'http://purl.org/dc/terms/title': [{'type': 'literal', 'value': \\\"Anna's Homepage\\\"}]}}\"\n\n# Replace single quotes with double quotes\ncorrected_data = data.replace(\"'\", '\"')\n\n# Parse the corrected JSON string\ntry:\n    parsed_data = json.loads(corrected_data)\n    print(parsed_data)\nexcept json.JSONDecodeError as e:\n    print(\"JSON decoding failed:\", e)\n```\n\nThis approach assumes that the single quotes are used only for JSON structure and not within the string values themselves. If your data contains single quotes within string values (like in \"Anna's Homepage\"), this method might require more sophisticated handling, such as converting only the structural quotes.\n\nIf the source of the JSON is something you can control, it's best to ensure that it's generated with double quotes to conform to JSON standards. If you don't control the source, you may need to implement a more robust solution that correctly identifies and replaces only the structural quotes."
