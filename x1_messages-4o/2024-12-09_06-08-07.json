My code looks something like this:\n\n```python\ng.db.execute('INSERT INTO downloads (name, owner, mimetype) VALUES (?, ?, ?)', [name, owner, mimetype])\nfile_entry = query_db('SELECT last_insert_rowid()')\ng.db.commit()\n```\nThe 'downloads' table has another column with attributes defined as `id integer primary key autoincrement`. My concern is, if two people were to write at the same time, this code could potentially produce errors. I'm trying to avoid messy transactions. Is there a built-in way in SQLite to cleanly return the primary key that was generated after performing an INSERT operation, other than using `last_insert_rowid()`?"

        "content": "In SQLite, the `last_insert_rowid()` function is the standard way to retrieve the last inserted row's ID in a session. It returns the row ID of the last row that was inserted into the database via the current database connection. This means it should be safe to use in your code as long as each request in your Flask application has its own database connection. Flask's `g` object is a great way to store this connection for the duration of a request, ensuring that each request gets its own database connection.\n\nIf you are concerned about multiple clients potentially interfering with each other's operations, here are some considerations and best practices you can employ:\n\n1. **Database Connection per Request**: Ensure that each request in your Flask application gets its own database connection. This is usually done by opening a connection at the start of a request and closing it after the request ends.\n\n2. **SQLite's Transaction Handling**: SQLite handles transactions automatically. When you execute an `INSERT` statement, SQLite will automatically start a transaction if one isn't already open, and will commit it when the statement finishes. This ensures that your insert operations are atomic.\n\n3. **Use Flask's Application Context**: Use Flask's `g` object to store the database connection for the duration of a request. This ensures that each request has its own connection.\n\n4. **Thread Safety**: Ensure your Flask application is configured to handle concurrent requests properly. In development, Flask's built-in server is single-threaded, but in production, you should use a production-ready server like Gunicorn or uWSGI which is capable of handling multiple requests simultaneously.\n\n5. **Explore the `RETURNING` Clause**: As of SQLite 3.35.0 (released in March 2021), SQLite supports the `RETURNING` clause which can be used to return columns of the rows that were modified/inserted. This can be used to directly retrieve the ID of the newly inserted row:\n   \n   ```python\n   cursor = g.db.execute('INSERT INTO downloads (name, owner, mimetype) VALUES (?, ?, ?) RETURNING id', [name, owner, mimetype])\n   file_entry = cursor.fetchone()\n   g.db.commit()\n   id_of_new_row = file_entry['id']\n   ```\n\nBy following these practices, you can ensure that your application handles database insertions reliably even under concurrent usage."
