Using the R code library(gutenbergr), library(dplyr), poe <- gutenberg_works(author == \"Poe, Edgar Allan\") %>% filter(grepl(\"Short Story\", subjects)) %>% select(title) and examining the returned table, could you provide me with the title of one of his short stories that you believe has a complex and intricate plot with a deep underlying meaning?"

However, the specific R code you provided may not yield the desired result since the Gutenberg database categorization might not specifically label stories with \"Short Story\" in the subjects. \n\nTo directly answer your question, one of Poe's short stories that is known for its complex plot and deep underlying meaning is \"The Fall of the House of Usher.\" This story explores themes of madness, isolation, and the supernatural, and is considered a masterpiece of Gothic literature. It delves into psychological complexity and the decaying state of both a family and its ancestral home, offering plenty of material for deep analysis."
