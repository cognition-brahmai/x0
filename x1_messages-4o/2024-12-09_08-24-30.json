I have an issue where it is impossible to know the number of Task B's needed to calculate Task C until Task A has been completed. Each Task B.* will take several hours to compute and cannot be combined. I have looked at subdags but it seems like it can only work with a static set of tasks that have to be determined at Dag creation. Would dag triggers work? If so, could you please provide an example?\n\n<pre><code>              |---&gt; Task B.1 --|\n              |---&gt; Task B.2 --|\n Task A ------|---&gt; Task B.3 --|-----&gt; Task C\n              |       ....     |\n              |---&gt; Task B.N --|\n</code></pre>\n\nI tried creating a blocking ExternalTaskSensor but it doesn't seem like a viable solution because all the Task B.* will take between 2-24 hours to complete. For example:\n\n<pre><code>Dag 1\nTask A -&gt; TriggerDagRunOperator(Dag 2) -&gt; ExternalTaskSensor(Dag 2, Task Dummy B) -&gt; Task C\n\nDag 2 (Dynamically created DAG though python_callable in TriggerDagrunOperator)\n               |-- Task B.1 --|\n               |-- Task B.2 --|\nTask Dummy A --|-- Task B.3 --|-----&gt; Task Dummy B\n               |     ....     |\n               |-- Task B.N --|\n</code></pre>"

        "content": "To create dynamic workflows in Apache Airflow where the number of tasks is unknown until the completion of a preceding task, you can use the `TaskGroup` feature in combination with dynamic task generation within your DAG definition. This approach allows you to generate tasks dynamically based on the output of a preceding task, which addresses the challenge you're facing.\n\nHere is a step-by-step guide to how you can implement this:\n\n1. **Define Task A**: This task will perform the initial computation and determine how many Task B instances are required.\n\n2. **Generate Dynamic Tasks**: After Task A completes, you can dynamically generate Task B tasks based on its output. Use PythonOperator or a similar operator and a loop to create these tasks.\n\n3. **Use Task Groups**: Task Groups can help you organize these dynamic tasks, making the DAG more readable and maintainable.\n\n4. **Aggregate and Proceed to Task C**: Once all Task B instances are complete, you can proceed to Task C.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how you might implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom airflow import DAG\nfrom airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator\nfrom airflow.utils.task_group import TaskGroup\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef task_a(**kwargs):\n    # Simulate determining the number of Task B instances\n    return 5  # For example, return 5 tasks\n\ndef create_task_b(task_number, **kwargs):\n    # Simulate a long-running task\n    print(f\"Running Task B.{task_number}\")\n\ndef task_c(**kwargs):\n    print(\"Aggregating results and completing Task C\")\n\nwith DAG('dynamic_workflow_example', start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1), schedule_interval=None, catchup=False) as dag:\n\n    task_a_op = PythonOperator(\n        task_id='task_a',\n        python_callable=task_a,\n        provide_context=True\n    )\n\n    def dynamic_task_generation(**kwargs):\n        ti = kwargs['ti']\n        b_count = ti.xcom_pull(task_ids='task_a')\n        task_group = TaskGroup(group_id='dynamic_tasks')\n\n        with task_group:\n            for i in range(b_count):\n                PythonOperator(\n                    task_id=f'task_b_{i+1}',\n                    python_callable=create_task_b,\n                    op_kwargs={'task_number': i+1},\n                    provide_context=True\n                )\n\n        return task_group\n\n    dynamic_tasks = PythonOperator(\n        task_id='generate_dynamic_tasks',\n        python_callable=dynamic_task_generation,\n        provide_context=True\n    )\n\n    task_c_op = PythonOperator(\n        task_id='task_c',\n        python_callable=task_c,\n        provide_context=True\n    )\n\n    task_a_op >> dynamic_tasks >> task_c_op\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Task A**: Executes and returns the number of Task B instances needed.\n- **Dynamic Task Generation**: A function creates a Task Group, where it generates Task B instances using PythonOperator, based on the number returned by Task A.\n- **Task Group**: Organizes dynamically generated tasks.\n- **Task C**: Executes after all Task B instances complete.\n\nThis approach keeps your DAG structure simple and maintains the flexibility to create tasks dynamically based on runtime data."
