Currently, if there's nothing to commit, git exits with a status of 1, which my deploy script interprets as an error and terminates. However, I still want to be able to detect real failures to commit. The current function I'm using for commit is:\n\n```python\ndef commit():\n    local(\"git add -p && git commit\")\n```\nHow can I differentiate between git commit failure due to no changes and other failures?"

        "content": "To allow your fabric script to handle cases where there is nothing to commit without terminating the script, you can modify the script to check the output of the `git commit` command and handle it accordingly. You can use the `--allow-empty` option with `git commit`, which allows the commit command to succeed even if there are no staged changes. However, this will create an empty commit, which may not be what you want.\n\nInstead, to avoid creating unnecessary empty commits, you can capture the exit status and output of the `git commit` command, and then check if the failure was due to nothing to commit. Here's how you can modify your function:\n\n```python\nfrom fabric.api import local, abort\nimport sys\n\ndef commit():\n    try:\n        local(\"git add -p\")\n        # Attempt to commit, capturing the output and exit code\n        result = local(\"git commit\", capture=True)\n    except SystemExit as e:\n        if \"nothing to commit\" in str(e):\n            print(\"No changes to commit, continuing...\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Commit failed due to an unexpected error.\")\n            sys.exit(1)\n```\n\nIn this modified version:\n\n- We use `local()` with `capture=True` to capture the output and exit code of the `git commit` command.\n- We wrap the `git commit` command within a try-except block to catch `SystemExit`.\n- If the commit fails with a message indicating \"nothing to commit,\" we print a message and continue.\n- If there's another reason for the commit to fail, we print an error message and exit.\n\nThis way, you can differentiate between the specific case of no changes to commit and other commit failures."
