I've installed vim-flake8 and vim-pathogen for PEP8 style guidelines but I want tabs to be expanded automatically when editing Python files, and not any other types of files. The settings I want to apply specifically for Python files are:\n\n```\nset expandtab       \" tabs are converted to spaces\nset tabstop=4       \" numbers of spaces of tab character\nset shiftwidth=4    \" numbers of spaces to (auto)indent\n```"

        "content": "To configure Vim to replace tabs with 4 spaces specifically when editing Python files, you can use Vim's `autocmd` feature. This allows you to apply specific settings based on the file type. Here\u2019s how you can achieve this:\n\n1. Open your Vim configuration file, typically located at `~/.vimrc`.\n\n2. Add the following lines to configure Vim to apply the settings only for Python files:\n\n```vim\n\" Use Vim's autocmd to set Python-specific settings\naugroup python_settings\n    autocmd!\n    autocmd FileType python setlocal expandtab tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4\naugroup END\n```\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of what these lines do:\n\n- `augroup python_settings` and `augroup END`: Define a group for your autocommands. This helps in organizing and avoiding duplicates.\n  \n- `autocmd!`: Clears any existing autocommands in the group to prevent duplicate settings.\n  \n- `autocmd FileType python`: Specifies that the following settings should apply only to files detected as Python (`FileType python`).\n\n- `setlocal`: Sets the options locally to the buffer. This means these settings will affect only Python files.\n\n- `expandtab`, `tabstop=4`, `shiftwidth=4`: The desired settings for Python files.\n\n3. Save the `~/.vimrc` file and restart Vim for the changes to take effect.\n\nWith this setup, Vim will automatically convert tabs to 4 spaces when you\u2019re editing Python files, adhering to PEP8 style guidelines, while leaving other file types unaffected."
