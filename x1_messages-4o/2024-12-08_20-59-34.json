Can you provide a C# code that calculates the degree of each polynomial and compares them to determine the highest degree equation that is not a quadratic?"

        "content": "Certainly! To find the highest degree polynomial equation that is not a quadratic from the given list, we can write a C# program that processes each equation, determines its degree, and then compares the degrees to find the highest one. Quadratic equations have a degree of 2, so we'll exclude them from consideration.\n\nHere is a sample C# code that accomplishes this:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Text.RegularExpressions;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        string[] polynomials = {\n            \"4x^3 + 2x^2 + 5x - 7\",\n            \"x^5 + 3x^4 - x^3 - 2x^2 + x + 1\",\n            \"6x^2 + 9x + 2\",\n            \"2x^4 - x^3 + 6x^2 - x + 3\"\n        };\n\n        int highestDegree = -1;\n        string highestDegreePolynomial = string.Empty;\n\n        foreach (var poly in polynomials)\n        {\n            int degree = GetPolynomialDegree(poly);\n            Console.WriteLine($\"Polynomial: {poly}, Degree: {degree}\");\n\n            if (degree > 2 && degree > highestDegree)\n            {\n                highestDegree = degree;\n                highestDegreePolynomial = poly;\n            }\n        }\n\n        Console.WriteLine($\"\\nThe highest degree polynomial that is not a quadratic is: {highestDegreePolynomial}\");\n    }\n\n    static int GetPolynomialDegree(string polynomial)\n    {\n        // Regular expression to find all occurrences of x^n\n        Regex regex = new Regex(@\"x\\^(\\d+)\");\n\n        // Find matches\n        MatchCollection matches = regex.Matches(polynomial);\n\n        int maxDegree = 0;\n\n        foreach (Match match in matches)\n        {\n            // Get the degree from the match\n            int degree = int.Parse(match.Groups[1].Value);\n            if (degree > maxDegree)\n            {\n                maxDegree = degree;\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Handle cases where x is present without ^n (implies degree 1)\n        if (maxDegree == 0 && polynomial.Contains(\"x\"))\n        {\n            maxDegree = 1;\n        }\n\n        return maxDegree;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Input**: We have an array `polynomials` containing the polynomial equations.\n2. **Regex**: We use a regular expression `x\\^(\\d+)` to capture terms of the form `x^n` and extract the degree `n`.\n3. **Degree Calculation**: For each polynomial, we compute its degree:\n   - We parse the degree from matches of `x^n`.\n   - If no `x^n` is found, but `x` is present, it implies degree 1.\n4. **Comparison**: We exclude quadratic equations and keep track of the highest degree polynomial found.\n5. **Output**: The program outputs the polynomial with the highest degree that is not a quadratic.\n\nThis code will output the polynomial with the highest degree that is not quadratic from the given list."
