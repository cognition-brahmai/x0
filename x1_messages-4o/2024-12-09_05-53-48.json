        "content": "Welcome to the world of Clojure and machine learning! If you're specifically looking for a machine learning framework that integrates with Hadoop and can be used with Clojure, you might want to consider the following options:\n\n1. **Apache Mahout**: Although Mahout itself is written in Java, it can be used with Clojure through interop. Mahout provides a scalable machine learning library that works well with Hadoop for tasks like clustering, classification, and collaborative filtering (ideal for recommendation engines).\n\n2. **Sparkling Water**: If you're open to using Apache Spark instead of Hadoop, Sparkling Water is an interesting option. It's an integration of H2O.ai's machine learning capabilities with Apache Spark, and it can be accessed from Clojure through its Java interop capabilities. H2O provides algorithms for building recommendation systems, among other ML tasks.\n\n3. **Flambo**: This is a Clojure library that provides a more Clojure-friendly interface to Apache Spark. While Spark is not Hadoop, it is often used in similar big data contexts and can be a good fit for building machine learning applications, including recommendation engines.\n\n4. **DeepLearning4j**: While primarily a deep learning framework, DL4J works well in distributed environments and can run on top of Hadoop. It can be accessed from Clojure using Java interop, and it includes support for creating recommendation systems.\n\n5. **Enclog**: This is a Clojure library built on top of Encog, a Java-based machine learning framework. While not specifically tailored for Hadoop, it can be used for various machine learning tasks, including recommendation engines.\n\nWhile Clojure-specific libraries for machine learning on Hadoop are limited, leveraging Java interop with existing Java-based solutions remains a practical approach. Additionally, consider exploring the Clojure community and forums, as they may have more recent tools or libraries tailored to your needs."
