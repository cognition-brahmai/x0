For example, given the list [ (.3, 'a'), (.4, 'b'), (.3, 'c')], I would like to sample 'b' 40% of the time. I am looking for a method similar to mnrnd in Matlab. I have checked the random module and numpy.random but they do not seem to have an appropriate function to solve this problem. I am not interested in writing a sampling scheme, but rather to be pointed to an easy way to sample from a multinomial distribution given a set of objects and weights."

        "content": "To sample an item according to its probability using Python, you can use the `random.choices` function from the `random` module, which was added in Python 3.6. This function allows you to specify weights for each item, effectively allowing you to sample according to a probability distribution.\n\nHere's how you can use `random.choices` to achieve your goal:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# List of tuples with probabilities and items\nitems = [(.3, 'a'), (.4, 'b'), (.3, 'c')]\n\n# Separate the probabilities and the items\nprobabilities, elements = zip(*items)\n\n# Use random.choices to sample an item according to the given probabilities\nsampled_item = random.choices(elements, weights=probabilities, k=1)[0]\n\nprint(sampled_item)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- `zip(*items)` is used to separate the probabilities and the items into two separate lists.\n- `random.choices(elements, weights=probabilities, k=1)` samples one item (`k=1`) from the `elements` list using the specified `weights`.\n\nThis approach is straightforward and leverages the capabilities of the standard library to sample according to a given probability distribution."
