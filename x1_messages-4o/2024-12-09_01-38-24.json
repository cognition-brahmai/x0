        "content": "It looks like the `node-gyp` tool, which is used to compile native add-ons for Node.js, is unable to find the Python executable. This can happen for a few reasons. Let's go through some steps to help resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify Python Installation**:\n   - Make sure Python is installed correctly by trying to run `python --version` from your terminal. It should return the Python version number.\n\n2. **Check if Python is in PATH**:\n   - Run `which python` to see where Python is installed. Ensure this path is included in your `PATH` environment variable.\n\n3. **Update `~/.bashrc`**:\n   - Your `~/.bashrc` should include Python's binary directory. If `which python` returns something like `/usr/bin/python`, make sure your `PATH` includes `/usr/bin`.\n\n4. **Set the PYTHON Environment Variable**:\n   - You might need to explicitly set the `PYTHON` environment variable to point to the Python executable. You can do this by adding the following line to your `~/.bashrc`:\n\n     ```bash\n     export PYTHON=/usr/bin/python\n     ```\n\n   - Replace `/usr/bin/python` with the path returned by `which python`.\n\n5. **Reload `~/.bashrc`**:\n   - After making changes to `~/.bashrc`, reload it by running:\n\n     ```bash\n     source ~/.bashrc\n     ```\n\n6. **Reinstall Node.js and npm**:\n   - Sometimes, issues can arise from outdated versions. Consider updating or reinstalling Node.js and npm to their latest versions.\n\n7. **Install Python 2.x**:\n   - `node-gyp` often requires Python 2.x. Make sure that Python 2.7.x is installed and set as the default Python, as Python 3.x might not be compatible.\n\n8. **Use `nvm` for Node.js**:\n   - Using Node Version Manager (`nvm`) can help manage different Node.js versions more seamlessly. Install it and try using it to manage your Node.js environment.\n\n9. **Try Setting Up a Virtual Environment**:\n   - If you're still encountering issues, consider setting up a virtual environment for your Python setup to isolate dependencies.\n\nAfter making these adjustments, try running the npm install command again. If you continue to face issues, please provide any additional error messages you encounter."
