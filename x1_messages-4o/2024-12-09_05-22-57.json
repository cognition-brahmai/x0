I have a Counter object as follows:\n\n```python\npair = collections.defaultdict(collections.Counter)\n```\nWhich represents data in the following form:\n\n```python\npair = {'doc1':  {'word1':4, 'word2':3}, \n        'doc2':  {'word1':2, 'word3':4},\n        'doc3':  {'word2':2, 'word4':1},\n         ...}\n```\nI want to keep the data structure but alter the type of the inner data (i.e., {'word1':4, 'word2':3}, {'word1':2, 'word3':4}, ...) from Counter to dict. I do not want to change the output, I just need that in each doc, the data type is dict, not Counter. I have attempted to achieve this using the following code:\n\n```python\nnew_pair = collections.defaultdict(collections.Counter)\nfor doc, tab in testing.form.items():\n    for word, freq in tab.items():\n        new_pair[doc][word] = freq \n```\nHowever, I am not sure how to create a dict for each doc. How can I do this?"

        "content": "To convert the `Counter` objects to regular dictionaries while maintaining the overall structure of your data, you can iterate through the `Counter` objects and convert them using the `dict()` function. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\n# Assuming pair is your original defaultdict with Counter objects\npair = {\n    'doc1': collections.Counter({'word1': 4, 'word2': 3}),\n    'doc2': collections.Counter({'word1': 2, 'word3': 4}),\n    'doc3': collections.Counter({'word2': 2, 'word4': 1}),\n    # Add any additional docs as needed\n}\n\n# Create a new defaultdict where the inner objects are regular dictionaries\nnew_pair = collections.defaultdict(dict)\n\n# Iterate over the original structure and populate the new one\nfor doc, counter in pair.items():\n    new_pair[doc] = dict(counter)  # Convert each Counter to a dict\n\n# Now, new_pair is a defaultdict with dictionaries instead of Counter objects\nprint(new_pair)\n```\n\nThis code snippet creates a new `defaultdict` called `new_pair` where each document's associated `Counter` is converted into a regular `dict`. The use of `dict(counter)` converts each `Counter` object into a dictionary, maintaining the key-value pairs."
