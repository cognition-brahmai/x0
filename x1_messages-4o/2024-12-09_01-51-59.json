I have a situation where I need to open a separate window containing one or two items after a button has been pushed and the relevant deferred gets executed. I am having trouble figuring out how to create this new separate window. Can anyone provide an example of how to achieve this?"

        "content": "Certainly! To create a separate window in a PyQt application, you'll need to define a new class for your secondary window that inherits from `QWidget` or `QMainWindow`. Then, you can instantiate this class and show it when a button is clicked in your main window. Here's a simple example to demonstrate how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow, QWidget, QPushButton, QVBoxLayout, QLabel\n\nclass SecondaryWindow(QWidget):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n\n        # Set the window title\n        self.setWindowTitle('Secondary Window')\n\n        # Create a layout and add a label to it\n        layout = QVBoxLayout()\n        label = QLabel('This is a secondary window', self)\n        layout.addWidget(label)\n\n        # Set the layout for the window\n        self.setLayout(layout)\n\nclass MainWindow(QMainWindow):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n\n        # Set the window title\n        self.setWindowTitle('Main Window')\n\n        # Create a button\n        self.button = QPushButton('Open Secondary Window', self)\n        self.button.clicked.connect(self.open_secondary_window)\n\n        # Set the central widget\n        self.setCentralWidget(self.button)\n\n        # Initialize secondary window instance\n        self.secondary_window = None\n\n    def open_secondary_window(self):\n        # Check if the secondary window already exists, if not, create it\n        if self.secondary_window is None:\n            self.secondary_window = SecondaryWindow()\n\n        # Show the secondary window\n        self.secondary_window.show()\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app = QApplication(sys.argv)\n\n    # Create an instance of the main window\n    main_window = MainWindow()\n    main_window.show()\n\n    # Start the event loop\n    sys.exit(app.exec_())\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **SecondaryWindow Class**: This class is a simple `QWidget` that represents the secondary window. It contains a label with some text.\n\n2. **MainWindow Class**: This is your main application window. It contains a button that, when clicked, will open the secondary window.\n\n3. **Button Click Event**: The `open_secondary_window` method checks if the `secondary_window` instance already exists. If not, it creates a new instance. It then calls `show()` on the secondary window to display it.\n\n4. **Execution**: The application is started by creating a `QApplication` object, instantiating the `MainWindow`, and entering the application's event loop with `app.exec_()`.\n\nThis setup will allow you to open a new window when you click the button in your main window. You can expand the `SecondaryWindow` class to include additional widgets or functionality as needed."
