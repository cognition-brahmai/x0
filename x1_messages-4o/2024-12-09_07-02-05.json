        "content": "The error you're encountering indicates that the `_tkinter` module, which is required for Tkinter to function, is not installed with your Python installation. This is a common issue when installing Python via package managers like Homebrew because the Tkinter library relies on certain system libraries that may not be included or linked correctly by default.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Homebrew is up to date**:\n   Make sure your Homebrew is updated to the latest version:\n   ```bash\n   brew update\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Tcl/Tk**:\n   Tkinter relies on Tcl/Tk, so you need to make sure you have it installed. You can install it using Homebrew:\n   ```bash\n   brew install tcl-tk\n   ```\n\n3. **Reinstall Python with Tkinter support**:\n   When installing Python, you need to specify the location of Tcl/Tk if it's not in a standard location. Install Python with the `--with-tcl-tk` option:\n   ```bash\n   brew install python --with-tcl-tk\n   ```\n\n4. **Link the Tcl/Tk frameworks**:\n   You may need to set environment variables so that Python can find Tkinter. Add these lines to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`):\n   ```bash\n   export LDFLAGS=\"-L/usr/local/opt/tcl-tk/lib\"\n   export CPPFLAGS=\"-I/usr/local/opt/tcl-tk/include\"\n   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/tcl-tk/lib/pkgconfig\"\n   ```\n\n5. **Restart your terminal**:\n   After making changes to your shell configuration file, restart your terminal or source your configuration file:\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bash_profile\n   ```\n   or\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.zshrc\n   ```\n\n6. **Verify the installation**:\n   Test whether Tkinter is now working by running Python and importing Tkinter:\n   ```python\n   python -c \"import Tkinter; Tkinter._test()\"\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the ImportError and successfully use Tkinter with your Python installation via Homebrew. If the problem persists, consider checking Homebrew's documentation or forums for any updates or changes in installation procedures."
