I understand the concept of feeding the activation to the function, but I am unsure why this parameter is referred to as 'logits'. Is 'logits' a mathematical function? Here is the code for reference:\n\n```python\nloss_function = tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(\n     logits = last_layer,\n     labels = target_output\n)\n```"

        "content": "The term \"logits\" in the context of machine learning, particularly in TensorFlow and other deep learning frameworks, is used to describe the raw, unnormalized scores output by a neural network's final layer before applying a softmax function. These logits can be considered as the network's raw predictions for each class.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why they're called \"logits\" and their role in the `softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits` function:\n\n1. **Logits**: The term \"logit\" is derived from logistic regression terminology. In the context of neural networks, logits are the values that are fed into a softmax function to produce probabilities for multiclass classification tasks. They represent the unnormalized log probabilities of each class. Essentially, logits are the output of the final linear transformation that the network applies before any activation function like softmax.\n\n2. **Softmax Function**: The softmax function is used to normalize these logits into a probability distribution over the classes. It exponentiates the logits and then normalizes them by dividing by the sum of the exponentials of all logits. This ensures that the output probabilities sum to 1.\n\n3. **Cross-Entropy Loss**: The `softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits` function combines the softmax activation and cross-entropy loss calculation in one step. By taking logits directly, it avoids numerical instability that might occur if softmax were applied separately before computing the cross-entropy loss.\n\n4. **Why Not Directly Use Probabilities?**: Using logits directly allows the function to be more numerically stable and efficient. Calculating the softmax and cross-entropy loss in one step allows the function to be optimized for performance, reducing potential issues with floating-point precision that might arise if these operations were done separately.\n\nBy using logits as input, TensorFlow's `softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits` function efficiently computes both the softmax probabilities and the cross-entropy loss, making it a preferred choice for training classifiers in neural networks."
