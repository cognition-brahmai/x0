However, I am encountering an error stating 'float' object has no attribute 'price'. I have also tried to create a function to update the price, but I receive an error that says 'AttributeError: can't set attribute'. Can someone let me know why this is happening and how can I successfully update the 'price'?\n\nHere's the code I have tried:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nBook = namedtuple('Book', 'author title genre year price instock')\nBSI = [\n    Book('Suzane Collins','The Hunger Games', 'Fiction', 2008, 6.96, 20),\n    Book('J.K. Rowling', \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\", 'Fantasy', 1997, 4.78, 12)]\nfor item in BSI:\n    item = item.price*1.10\nprint(item.price)\n```\n\nAnd the function I have tried:\n\n```python\ndef restaurant_change_price(rest, newprice):\n    rest.price = rest._replace(price = rest.price + newprice)\n    return rest.price\nprint(restaurant_change_price(Restaurant(\"Taillevent\", \"French\", \"343-3434\", \"Escargots\", 24.50), 25))\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is because `namedtuple` instances are immutable, meaning you can't change their fields directly after they've been created. This is why you're seeing the `AttributeError: can't set attribute` when you try to update the `price` field. To solve this problem, you need to create a new `Book` instance with the updated price using the `_replace` method, which is specifically designed for this purpose.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to update the price by 20% for each book:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import namedtuple\n\n# Define the namedtuple\nBook = namedtuple('Book', 'author title genre year price instock')\n\n# List of books\nBSI = [\n    Book('Suzane Collins', 'The Hunger Games', 'Fiction', 2008, 6.96, 20),\n    Book('J.K. Rowling', \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\", 'Fantasy', 1997, 4.78, 12)\n]\n\n# Create a new list with updated prices\nupdated_BSI = [item._replace(price=item.price * 1.20) for item in BSI]\n\n# Print the updated prices\nfor item in updated_BSI:\n    print(f\"Updated price for '{item.title}': {item.price}\")\n```\n\nIn the above code, a new list `updated_BSI` is created using a list comprehension. Each `Book` in the original list is replaced with a new `Book` instance where the price is increased by 20%. The `_replace` method is used to create a new instance with the updated price while keeping the rest of the fields the same.\n\nAs for the function you tried to write, the `_replace` method should be used correctly to update the `price` field. Here is how you can define such a function:\n\n```python\ndef update_book_price(book, increase_percentage):\n    # Increase the price by the given percentage\n    new_price = book.price * (1 + increase_percentage / 100)\n    # Return a new Book instance with the updated price\n    return book._replace(price=new_price)\n\n# Example usage\nnew_price_book = update_book_price(BSI[0], 20)\nprint(f\"Updated price for '{new_price_book.title}': {new_price_book.price}\")\n```\n\nThis function takes a `Book` instance and a percentage by which to increase the price, and returns a new `Book` instance with the updated price."
