These functions were taken from the old Keras source code. However, when I compile my model using these functions as metrics, I get a ValueError: Unknown metric function:precision. According to Keras documentation, I can't find anything wrong with my approach. Below are the functions and the compile statement I used:\n\n```python\ndef precision(y_true, y_pred): #taken from old keras source code\n     true_positives = K.sum(K.round(K.clip(y_true * y_pred, 0, 1)))\n     predicted_positives = K.sum(K.round(K.clip(y_pred, 0, 1)))\n     precision = true_positives / (predicted_positives + K.epsilon())\n     return precision\ndef recall(y_true, y_pred): #taken from old keras source code\n     true_positives = K.sum(K.round(K.clip(y_true * y_pred, 0, 1)))\n     possible_positives = K.sum(K.round(K.clip(y_true, 0, 1)))\n     recall = true_positives / (possible_positives + K.epsilon())\n     return recall\n\nmodel.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', \nmetrics=['accuracy', precision, recall])\n```\n\nThis is the error trace:\n\n```python\nValueError: Unknown metric function:precision\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\n  File \"/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/keras/models.py\", line 274, in \nload_model\n    sample_weight_mode=sample_weight_mode)\n  File \"/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/keras/models.py\", line 824, in \ncompile\n     **kwargs)\n  File \"/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/keras/engine/training.py\", line \n934, in compile\n     handle_metrics(output_metrics)\n   File \"/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/keras/engine/training.py\", line \n901, in handle_metrics\n    metric_fn = metrics_module.get(metric)\n  File \"/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/keras/metrics.py\", line 75, in get\n     return deserialize(str(identifier))\n  File \"/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/keras/metrics.py\", line 67, in \ndeserialize\n    printable_module_name='metric function')\n  File \"/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/keras/utils/generic_utils.py\", \nline 164, in deserialize_keras_object\n    ':' + function_name)\nValueError: Unknown metric function:precision\n```\n\nI am not sure what I am doing wrong.

        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that Keras is unable to recognize your custom metric functions, `precision` and `recall`, because they are not defined in Keras's default set of metrics. When using custom metrics, Keras needs to be able to reference these functions at runtime. Here are a few steps you can follow to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Correct Import Statements**: Make sure you have imported the necessary Keras backend functions correctly. For example:\n   ```python\n   from keras import backend as K\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Keras Version Compatibility**: Ensure that you are using a compatible version of Keras and TensorFlow, as APIs can change between versions.\n\n3. **Use Functions Directly**: When adding custom metrics, you typically need to pass the function objects directly without quotes. Your compile statement seems correct in this regard:\n   ```python\n   model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', \n                 optimizer='adam', \n                 metrics=['accuracy', precision, recall])\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify TensorFlow/Keras Backend**: Ensure that your environment is set up with the appropriate versions of Keras and TensorFlow. You can use:\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n   print(tf.__version__)\n   print(tf.keras.__version__)\n   ```\n\n5. **Custom Object Scope (Optional)**: If you are loading a saved model later and still want to use these custom metrics, you need to provide a custom object scope:\n   ```python\n   from keras.utils import CustomObjectScope\n\n   with CustomObjectScope({'precision': precision, 'recall': recall}):\n       model = tf.keras.models.load_model('my_model.h5')\n   ```\n\n6. **Use TensorFlow Keras**: If you are using TensorFlow 2.x, consider using `tf.keras`:\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n   from tensorflow.keras import backend as K\n   ```\n\n7. **Test Custom Functions**: Verify that your custom functions can execute without error outside of the model context, just to ensure there are no issues with them.\n\nIf you have followed all these steps and the issue persists, consider checking for any typos or discrepancies in other parts of your code. You might also want to isolate the problem by testing the functions in a minimal setup to ensure they work as expected."
