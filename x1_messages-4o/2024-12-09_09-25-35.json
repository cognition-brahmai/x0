        "content": "Certainly! In JavaScript, you can demonstrate both inheritance and composition using object-oriented programming principles. Below, I'll provide examples of both concepts.\n\n### Inheritance\n\nInheritance allows one class (or function constructor in JavaScript) to inherit properties and methods from another class. In JavaScript, this can be achieved using the `extends` keyword with classes.\n\n```javascript\n// Base class\nclass Animal {\n  constructor(name, age) {\n    this.name = name;\n    this.age = age;\n  }\n\n  speak() {\n    console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);\n  }\n}\n\n// Derived class\nclass Dog extends Animal {\n  constructor(name, age, breed) {\n    super(name, age); // Calls the constructor of the base class\n    this.breed = breed;\n  }\n\n  speak() {\n    console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);\n  }\n}\n\nconst dog = new Dog('Buddy', 3, 'Golden Retriever');\ndog.speak(); // Output: Buddy barks.\n```\n\n### Composition\n\nComposition is a design principle where classes are composed using objects from other classes, rather than inheriting from them. This allows for more flexible design and reuse of code.\n\n```javascript\n// Components\nclass Engine {\n  start() {\n    console.log('Engine started.');\n  }\n}\n\nclass Wheels {\n  roll() {\n    console.log('Wheels are rolling.');\n  }\n}\n\n// Car class composed of Engine and Wheels\nclass Car {\n  constructor() {\n    this.engine = new Engine();\n    this.wheels = new Wheels();\n  }\n\n  drive() {\n    this.engine.start();\n    this.wheels.roll();\n    console.log('Car is driving.');\n  }\n}\n\nconst myCar = new Car();\nmyCar.drive();\n// Output:\n// Engine started.\n// Wheels are rolling.\n// Car is driving.\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Inheritance**: The `Dog` class inherits from the `Animal` class. It overrides the `speak` method to provide a specific implementation for dogs. This demonstrates how derived classes can inherit and customize behavior from base classes.\n\n- **Composition**: The `Car` class is composed of `Engine` and `Wheels` objects. Instead of inheriting from these classes, `Car` uses instances of these classes to perform its tasks. This demonstrates how you can build complex objects by combining simpler ones.\n\nBoth inheritance and composition are useful concepts in object-oriented programming, and choosing between them depends on the specific use case and requirements of your application."
