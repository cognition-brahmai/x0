Here is the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import exc\n\ntry:\n    insert_record()\nexcept exc.IntegrityError, exc:\n    print exc # this is never called\n    handle_elegantly() # this is never called\n```\n\nHowever, the error isn't caught and I get the following IntegrityError:\n\n```\nIntegrityError: (IntegrityError) insert or update on table \"my_table\" \n                violates foreign key constraint \"my_table_some_column_fkey\"\n```\n\nI've tried explicitly importing IntegrityError from sqlalchemy.exc. I also found that the IntegrityError isn't thrown until the session is flushed to the database, and after the try/except blocks have been executed. However, when I add `session.flush()` in the try block, I get an InvalidRequestError:\n\n```\nERROR:root:This Session's transaction has been rolled back due to a previous \n           exception during flush. To begin a new transaction with this Session, \n           first issue Session.rollback(). \n           Original exception was: (IntegrityError)\n```\n\nHow can I catch the IntegrityError correctly?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the timing of when the `IntegrityError` is raised. SQLAlchemy usually raises `IntegrityError` when the transaction is committed or flushed, which might be happening outside your try/except block. Additionally, the `InvalidRequestError` you see indicates that the session is in a \"broken\" state after an exception during a flush, and it needs to be rolled back before you can proceed with further operations.\n\nTo properly catch the `IntegrityError`, ensure that you handle the session's flush or commit in the try/except block. Here's how you can modify your code to correctly catch the error:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import exc\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\nfrom my_database_setup import engine, MyTable\n\nSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\nsession = Session()\n\ntry:\n    insert_record()  # Assuming this function adds a record to the session\n    session.flush()  # Flush the session to apply the insert\nexcept exc.IntegrityError as e:\n    print(e)  # Handle the exception\n    session.rollback()  # Rollback the session to a clean state\n    handle_elegantly()  # Your custom error handling\nfinally:\n    session.close()  # Ensure the session is closed\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Session Management:** Use `session.flush()` inside the try block to ensure the error is raised within the scope of the exception handling.\n2. **Rollback on Exception:** When an `IntegrityError` occurs, immediately call `session.rollback()` to reset the session's state and allow further operations.\n3. **Session Closure:** Use `session.close()` in a `finally` block to ensure the session is closed properly, preventing resource leaks.\n\nMake sure that `insert_record()` is adding the record to the session but not committing it, as committing should be handled explicitly in your transaction management logic."
