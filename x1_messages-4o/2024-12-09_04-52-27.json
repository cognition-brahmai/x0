I'm having trouble with this line of code: `if test_data: n_test = len(test_data)`. When I run it, I encounter the following error: `TypeError: object of type 'zip' has no len()`. How can I modify this code to work with Python 3.4?"

        "content": "In Python 2.7, the `zip()` function returns a list of tuples, which means it has a length and can be used directly with the `len()` function. However, in Python 3.x, `zip()` returns an iterator, which does not have a length. This is why you're encountering the `TypeError` when trying to use `len()` on a `zip` object.\n\nTo resolve this issue in Python 3.4, you can convert the `zip` object to a list to get its length. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nif test_data:\n    n_test = len(list(test_data))\n```\n\nHowever, be cautious when converting `zip` objects to lists, especially if `test_data` is large, as this will load all the data into memory. If `test_data` is intended to be used as an iterator elsewhere in your code, you may want to store the list conversion in a separate variable:\n\n```python\nif test_data:\n    test_data_list = list(test_data)\n    n_test = len(test_data_list)\n```\n\nThis way, you can maintain the iterator functionality of `test_data` if needed elsewhere in your code."
