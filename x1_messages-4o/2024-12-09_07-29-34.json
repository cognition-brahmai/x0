Specifically, I'd like to implement a function called 'magic' that takes an integer as an input and returns a list of individual digits as output. For instance, if the input is 123, the output should be [1, 2, 3]. Could you guide me on how to achieve this?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can create the `magic` function in Python to convert an integer into a list of its individual digits by following these steps:\n\n1. Convert the integer to a string to easily access each digit.\n2. Iterate over each character in the string representation of the number.\n3. Convert each character back to an integer.\n4. Collect the integers in a list.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef magic(number):\n    # Convert the number to a string\n    number_str = str(number)\n    # Convert each character back to an integer and collect them in a list\n    digits_list = [int(digit) for digit in number_str]\n    return digits_list\n\n# Example usage:\nresult = magic(123)\nprint(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nThis function will take any non-negative integer and return a list of its digits. If you want to handle negative numbers as well, you might consider adding additional logic to manage the negative sign."
