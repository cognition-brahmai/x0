Instead, you must come up with a creative solution using only HTML and CSS.\nYour challenge is to create a webpage that displays the current date and time, updating every second. The catch is that you cannot use any scripting languages or external libraries.\nThink outside the box and use CSS animations, transitions, and other techniques to achieve this goal. Be creative and show off your skills in web design.\nHint: You can use the :after pseudo-element in CSS to add content to an element, and the content property can be used to add text to that element. You can also use the transform property to rotate, scale, or move elements."

        "content": "Creating a solution to display the current date and time on a webpage without using JavaScript or any scripting language is quite challenging due to the static nature of HTML and CSS. However, we can simulate a clock effect using CSS animations and pseudo-elements. Here's a conceptual approach:\n\n### HTML Structure\n\nTo create a basic structure for the clock, we can use HTML elements to represent different parts of the clock face (e.g., hour, minute, and second hands).\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>CSS Clock</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div class=\"clock\">\n        <div class=\"hand hour\"></div>\n        <div class=\"hand minute\"></div>\n        <div class=\"hand second\"></div>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### CSS Styling\n\nThe CSS will be used to style the clock and create the illusion of movement through animations.\n\n```css\nbody {\n    display: flex;\n    justify-content: center;\n    align-items: center;\n    height: 100vh;\n    background-color: #f0f0f0;\n    margin: 0;\n}\n\n.clock {\n    position: relative;\n    width: 200px;\n    height: 200px;\n    border: 10px solid #333;\n    border-radius: 50%;\n    background-color: white;\n}\n\n.hand {\n    position: absolute;\n    bottom: 50%;\n    left: 50%;\n    width: 50%;\n    height: 4px;\n    background: #333;\n    transform-origin: 100%;\n    transform: rotate(0deg);\n}\n\n.hour {\n    animation: rotateHour 43200s linear infinite;\n}\n\n.minute {\n    animation: rotateMinute 3600s linear infinite;\n}\n\n.second {\n    height: 2px;\n    background: red;\n    animation: rotateSecond 60s linear infinite;\n}\n\n@keyframes rotateHour {\n    from { transform: rotate(0deg); }\n    to { transform: rotate(360deg); }\n}\n\n@keyframes rotateMinute {\n    from { transform: rotate(0deg); }\n    to { transform: rotate(360deg); }\n}\n\n@keyframes rotateSecond {\n    from { transform: rotate(0deg); }\n    to { transform: rotate(360deg); }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **HTML Structure**: The HTML is kept simple, with a container `.clock` and three child elements representing the clock hands. Each hand is styled with CSS to position correctly and rotate around the clock face.\n\n- **CSS Animations**: The keyframes `rotateHour`, `rotateMinute`, and `rotateSecond` are used to animate the hands of the clock. They rotate from 0 to 360 degrees. The durations of the animations are set to simulate real-time rotation: 43200 seconds for the hour hand (12 hours), 3600 seconds for the minute hand (60 minutes), and 60 seconds for the second hand.\n\n### Limitations\n\nThis approach creates a visually appealing clock, but it does not accurately display the current time from the user's system because there are no scripting capabilities to pull the actual time. The clock will start from 12:00:00 when the page is loaded and will continue to animate from there.\n\nIn summary, while this solution doesn't exactly provide the live current time due to lack of scripting, it creatively uses CSS animations to simulate a functioning clock."
