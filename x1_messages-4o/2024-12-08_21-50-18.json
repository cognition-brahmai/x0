        "content": "In Python, the `sorted()` function is used to sort iterables like lists, tuples, or strings. The `key` argument in the `sorted()` function is used to specify a function that serves as a key for the sort comparison. This function is applied to each element of the iterable before the sorting process, and the elements are compared based on the results of this function.\n\nThe `key` argument allows for more complex sorting patterns, such as sorting by the length of strings, by a specific attribute of objects, or by custom logic defined in a function.\n\nHere\u2019s a basic example to illustrate how the `key` argument works:\n\n```python\n# List of strings\nwords = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"date\"]\n\n# Sort by length of string\nsorted_words = sorted(words, key=len)\n\nprint(sorted_words)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `sorted()` function sorts the list of words by their length, using the built-in `len` function as the key.\n\nAnother example using a custom function:\n\n```python\n# List of dictionaries\nstudents = [\n    {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"grade\": 85},\n    {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"grade\": 75},\n    {\"name\": \"Charlie\", \"grade\": 95}\n]\n\n# Function to extract grade\ndef get_grade(student):\n    return student[\"grade\"]\n\n# Sort by grade\nsorted_students = sorted(students, key=get_grade)\n\nprint(sorted_students)\n```\n\nIn this example, we have a list of dictionaries representing students and their grades. The `sorted()` function uses the `get_grade` function as the key to sort the students by their grades."
