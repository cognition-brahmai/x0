I'm currently facing an issue with Django Admin where I can't assign NULL to a field through it, even though I've set my Model field to `null=True` which allows NULL in MySQL. I've also tried setting `blank=True`, but that just sets the field to an empty string. I tried following a solution I found online, but it just set the field value to \"None\", the string. What is the correct way to approach this issue?"

        "content": "To configure Django Admin to allow setting a field to `NULL`, you need to make sure your model field is correctly set up and that the admin form allows for a `NULL` value. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Model Configuration**:\n   Make sure your model field is configured with `null=True` and `blank=True`. The `null=True` part allows the database to store `NULL` values, while `blank=True` allows the admin form to accept empty input.\n\n   ```python\n   from django.db import models\n\n   class MyModel(models.Model):\n       my_field = models.CharField(max_length=255, null=True, blank=True)\n   ```\n\n2. **Admin Configuration**:\n   In the Django Admin, you need to override the form field to ensure it can handle `NULL`. You can achieve this by customizing the form used in the admin.\n\n   ```python\n   from django import forms\n   from django.contrib import admin\n   from .models import MyModel\n\n   class MyModelForm(forms.ModelForm):\n       class Meta:\n           model = MyModel\n           fields = '__all__'\n\n       def clean_my_field(self):\n           data = self.cleaned_data['my_field']\n           # If the field is empty, return None instead of an empty string\n           if data == '':\n               return None\n           return data\n\n   class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n       form = MyModelForm\n\n   admin.site.register(MyModel, MyModelAdmin)\n   ```\n\n3. **Handling Empty Values**:\n   In the `clean_my_field` method of your form, you explicitly check if the input is an empty string and return `None` if it is. This ensures that an empty form field will set the database value to `NULL`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to configure Django Admin to allow setting a field to `NULL` without it being converted to an empty string or the string \"None\". Make sure to replace `my_field` and `MyModel` with the actual field and model names you're working with."
