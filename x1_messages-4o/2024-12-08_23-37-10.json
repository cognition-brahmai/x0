You need to figure out who the imposter is in order to fire them and avoid potential harm to the company.\nYou decide to ask each employee one question to determine who is the imposter. However, you can only ask one of the following questions to each employee:\n1. What is your job position?\n2. What did you do yesterday?\n3. What is your favorite color?\n4. Do you know who the imposter is?\nThe imposter will give a false answer to any of the questions, while the other three employees will give truthful answers. What is the optimal strategy to determine who the imposter is?"

They are not aware of who lies as they all speak truthfully themselves.\n   \n   - **Imposter:** The imposter, who always lies, will answer \"Yes,\" because the truthful answer would be \"No,\" and the imposter lies about everything.\n\nBy asking this question to all employees, you can identify the imposter as the one who answers \"Yes.\" This strategy ensures that you can pinpoint the imposter with just one question per employee."
