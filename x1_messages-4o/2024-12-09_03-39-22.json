This is because the CUDA driver cleans up all resources associated with a process once it terminates, including any memory allocations on the GPU. Therefore, while it is good practice to explicitly free memory using `cudaFree()` to avoid resource leaks during the application's execution, the memory will eventually be freed once the application exits."
