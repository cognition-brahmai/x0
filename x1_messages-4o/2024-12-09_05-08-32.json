        "content": "To disable all warnings produced by `warnings.warn` in an IPython session, you can use Python's `warnings` module to filter out warnings. Here's how you can do it directly in your IPython session:\n\n1. **Using the `warnings` module:**\n\n   You can suppress all warnings by adding the following lines to the beginning of your script or your IPython session:\n\n   ```python\n   import warnings\n   warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n   ```\n\n   This will ignore all warnings. You can also be more selective by specifying the type of warnings you want to ignore.\n\n2. **Configuring the IPython startup file:**\n\n   If you want to automatically suppress warnings every time you start an IPython session, you can add the above lines to your IPython startup file. Here's how you can do it:\n\n   - Locate your IPython profile directory. You can find it by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\n\n     ```bash\n     ipython profile locate\n     ```\n\n   - Inside this directory, there should be a `startup` folder. If it doesn't exist, you can create it.\n\n   - Create a new Python file inside the `startup` folder, for example, `00-warnings.py`.\n\n   - Add the following lines to this file:\n\n     ```python\n     import warnings\n     warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n     ```\n\n   This will ensure that warnings are suppressed every time you start an IPython session.\n\nBy following these steps, you can produce a clean screencast without the distraction of warnings."
