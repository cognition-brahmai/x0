        "content": "To perform greater than or less than operations in MongoDB using the PyMongo driver, you can use the `$gt`, `$lt`, `$gte`, and `$lte` operators in your queries. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Install PyMongo**: If you haven't already, you need to install the PyMongo package. You can do this using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pymongo\n   ```\n\n2. **Connect to MongoDB**: First, you need to establish a connection to your MongoDB database.\n\n   ```python\n   from pymongo import MongoClient\n\n   # Replace 'your_connection_string' with your actual MongoDB connection string\n   client = MongoClient('your_connection_string')\n   db = client['your_database_name']\n   collection = db['your_collection_name']\n   ```\n\n3. **Perform Greater Than or Less Than Queries**:\n\n   - **Greater Than (`$gt`)**:\n\n     ```python\n     # Query for documents where 'field_name' is greater than a certain value\n     greater_than_query = {'field_name': {'$gt': value}}\n     results_gt = collection.find(greater_than_query)\n\n     for document in results_gt:\n         print(document)\n     ```\n\n   - **Less Than (`$lt`)**:\n\n     ```python\n     # Query for documents where 'field_name' is less than a certain value\n     less_than_query = {'field_name': {'$lt': value}}\n     results_lt = collection.find(less_than_query)\n\n     for document in results_lt:\n         print(document)\n     ```\n\n   - **Greater Than or Equal To (`$gte`)**:\n\n     ```python\n     # Query for documents where 'field_name' is greater than or equal to a certain value\n     greater_than_equal_query = {'field_name': {'$gte': value}}\n     results_gte = collection.find(greater_than_equal_query)\n\n     for document in results_gte:\n         print(document)\n     ```\n\n   - **Less Than or Equal To (`$lte`)**:\n\n     ```python\n     # Query for documents where 'field_name' is less than or equal to a certain value\n     less_than_equal_query = {'field_name': {'$lte': value}}\n     results_lte = collection.find(less_than_equal_query)\n\n     for document in results_lte:\n         print(document)\n     ```\n\nReplace `'field_name'` with the name of the field you want to compare and `value` with the value you are comparing against. This will filter documents in the collection based on the specified condition.\n\nMake sure to replace `'your_connection_string'`, `'your_database_name'`, and `'your_collection_name'` with your actual MongoDB connection details and database/collection names."
