I came across a code snippet that looked like this:\n\n```python\nclass State(IntEnum):\n    READY = 1\n    IN_PROGRESS = 2\n    FINISHED = 3\n    FAILED = 4\n```\nI am wondering what benefits or features does inheriting from `IntEnum` provide that inheriting from the regular class `Enum` doesn't?"

        "content": "In Python, both `Enum` and `IntEnum` are part of the `enum` module and are used to define enumerations, which are a way to create symbolic names for a set of values. Here are the key differences and benefits of using `IntEnum` over `Enum`:\n\n1. **Integer Compatibility**: \n   - `IntEnum` members are also instances of the `int` type, which means they can be used directly in arithmetic operations and comparisons with integers. This is particularly useful if you need to interact with APIs or libraries that expect integer inputs.\n   - `Enum` members are not inherently integers, so they do not support arithmetic operations or direct comparisons with integers.\n\n2. **Behavior with Integers**:\n   - `IntEnum` allows comparison and equality checks directly with integers. For example, `State.READY == 1` will return `True` if `State` is an `IntEnum`.\n   - With `Enum`, direct comparison to integers would not be valid, as `Enum` values are distinct from integers.\n\n3. **Use Cases**:\n   - Use `IntEnum` when you need enumerated values that will be used as integers, especially when dealing with systems or protocols that require integer status codes or flags.\n   - Use `Enum` when you simply need to define a set of named values without the need for them to behave like integers.\n\nHere is a brief illustration:\n\n```python\nfrom enum import Enum, IntEnum\n\nclass Color(Enum):\n    RED = 1\n    GREEN = 2\n    BLUE = 3\n\nclass State(IntEnum):\n    READY = 1\n    IN_PROGRESS = 2\n    FINISHED = 3\n    FAILED = 4\n\n# Behavior with integers\nprint(State.READY == 1)  # True, because State.READY is an IntEnum\nprint(Color.RED == 1)    # False, because Color.RED is an Enum\n\n# Arithmetic operations\nprint(State.READY + 1)   # Valid, outputs 2\n# print(Color.RED + 1)   # Invalid, will raise TypeError\n```\n\nIn summary, the choice between `Enum` and `IntEnum` should be based on whether you need the enumeration members to behave like integers or not. `IntEnum` provides the additional capability of integer-like behavior, which is useful for certain applications."
