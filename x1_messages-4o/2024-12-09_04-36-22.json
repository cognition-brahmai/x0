I have defined a new DAG in a file called 'tutorial_2.py', which is a copy of the 'tutorial.py' provided in the Airflow tutorial, with the 'dag_id' changed to 'tutorial_2'. However, when I run 'airflow list_dags', the 'tutorial_2' does not appear in my DAG list. The 'dags_folder' in my default, unmodified 'airflow.cfg' (located in '~/airflow') is set to '/home/alex/airflow/dags'. I followed the steps to create a 'dags' folder matching the path set in 'airflow.cfg', and copied 'tutorial_2.py' into it. I've tried running 'python tutorial_2.py' and 'airflow resetdb', but neither have caused 'tutorial_2' to appear in the list. How can I ensure that my new DAG is detected by Airflow?"

        "content": "To ensure your new DAG is detected by Apache Airflow, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Verify File Location**: \n   - Double-check that your `tutorial_2.py` file is indeed located in the `/home/alex/airflow/dags` directory, as specified in your `airflow.cfg`. Make sure there are no typos in the file name or path.\n\n2. **Validate DAG Code**:\n   - Ensure that your DAG code is correct and there are no syntax errors. You can do this by running the Python script directly (e.g., `python tutorial_2.py`) and checking for any errors.\n\n3. **Check DAG Definition**:\n   - Make sure the `dag_id` in `tutorial_2.py` is unique and correctly defined. For example:\n     ```python\n     dag = DAG(\n         'tutorial_2',\n         default_args=default_args,\n         description='A simple tutorial DAG',\n         schedule_interval=timedelta(days=1),\n     )\n     ```\n\n4. **Permissions**:\n   - Ensure that your Airflow user has the necessary permissions to read the `tutorial_2.py` file and access the `/home/alex/airflow/dags` directory.\n\n5. **Airflow Scheduler**:\n   - Ensure your Airflow scheduler is running. The scheduler is responsible for parsing DAG files and should be active to detect new or updated DAGs.\n\n6. **Restart Airflow Services**:\n   - Sometimes restarting Airflow services can clear any transient issues. Try restarting both the web server and scheduler:\n     ```shell\n     airflow scheduler &\n     airflow webserver &\n     ```\n\n7. **Environment Variables**:\n   - Make sure that your environment variables are set correctly, especially if you are using a virtual environment. Activate your environment if necessary.\n\n8. **Log Files**:\n   - Check the Airflow scheduler logs for any error messages that might give you more insight into why the DAG is not being detected.\n\n9. **Airflow Version**:\n   - Ensure that you are using a compatible version of Airflow and Python. Sometimes, version mismatches can cause unexpected issues.\n\n10. **Database Connection**:\n    - Ensure that your Airflow database is set up correctly and accessible. The `airflow resetdb` command should usually reset the database, but verify if the database service is running and properly configured.\n\nIf after following these steps your DAG still doesn't appear, it might be worth simplifying the DAG to the most basic form and gradually adding complexity back in, to identify if there's a specific issue causing the problem."
