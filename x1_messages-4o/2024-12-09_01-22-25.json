        "content": "You can achieve this by using the `pandas` library in Python, which provides a convenient way to work with data in tabular form. To create a new column 'C' that contains the maximum value between corresponding entries in columns 'A' and 'B', you can use the `pandas.DataFrame.apply` method along with a lambda function. Here is how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample dataframe\ndata = {'A': [1, 4, 3, 7],\n        'B': [2, 3, 5, 6]}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Creating a new column 'C' with the maximum values between 'A' and 'B'\ndf['C'] = df.apply(lambda row: max(row['A'], row['B']), axis=1)\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nIn this code, `df.apply(lambda row: max(row['A'], row['B']), axis=1)` applies the lambda function to each row in the DataFrame. The lambda function takes each row as input and calculates the maximum value between the elements in columns 'A' and 'B'. The `axis=1` parameter ensures that the function is applied row-wise. The result is assigned to the new column 'C' in the DataFrame."
