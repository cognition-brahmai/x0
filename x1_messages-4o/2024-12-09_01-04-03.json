For instance, in the model below that explicitly specifies 2 Dense layers, is this actually a model consisting of three layers - one input layer implied by the input shape, one hidden dense layer with 32 neurons, and then one output layer with 10 possible outputs?\n\n```python\nmodel = Sequential([\n    Dense(32, input_shape=(784,)),\n    Activation('relu'),\n    Dense(10),\n    Activation('softmax'),\n])\n```"

        "content": "In Keras, the `Sequential` model is a linear stack of layers. When you specify the `input_shape` in the first layer, it does not explicitly create a separate input layer. Instead, it informs the first layer about the shape of the input data it will receive. So, in your example, the model consists of:\n\n1. **First Dense Layer**: This is the first actual layer in the model. It has 32 neurons and expects input data with a shape of (784,). The `input_shape` parameter is used to specify the shape of the input data. The activation function applied here is ReLU.\n\n2. **Second Dense Layer**: This is the output layer in your model. It has 10 neurons, corresponding to 10 possible output classes, and uses the softmax activation function to produce a probability distribution over the 10 classes.\n\nTherefore, your model does not have a separate, explicit input layer. The input shape is used to configure the first Dense layer. The model is effectively made up of two Dense layers, with the input shape simply being a parameter of the first layer to define the shape of the expected input data."
