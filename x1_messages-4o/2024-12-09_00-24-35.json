The workers compute the gradients dJ/dw (the gradient of the loss J with respect to the parameter weights w), but who applies the gradient descent update rule? Based on the O'Reilly article on Distributed TensorFlow, it seems that in asynchronous training, the workers compute gradients and send it to the parameter server, the parameter server broadcasts the gradients to the workers, and each worker receives the broadcasted gradients and applies the update rule. Is my understanding correct? It doesn't seem very asynchronous to me because the workers have to wait for the parameter server to broadcast the gradients."

        "content": "In distributed TensorFlow, the roles of the workers and the parameter server can vary depending on the training strategy being used\u2014such as synchronous or asynchronous training. Let's clarify the roles in the context of asynchronous training, which seems to be the source of your confusion.\n\n### Asynchronous Training\n\n1. **Workers**: \n   - Each worker independently computes the gradients \\( \\nabla J(\\mathbf{w}) \\) based on the batch of data it processes.\n   - After computing the gradients, the worker sends these gradients to the parameter server.\n\n2. **Parameter Server**:\n   - The parameter server receives gradients from the workers and updates the model parameters \\( \\mathbf{w} \\) using these gradients.\n   - The parameter server does not need to wait for all workers to finish their computations. It processes updates as they arrive, hence the process is asynchronous.\n   - After updating the parameters, the updated parameters are available to all workers for their subsequent computations.\n\n3. **Workers (continued)**:\n   - Each worker fetches the most recent parameters from the parameter server before starting its next computation. The workers do not wait for the parameter server to send updates; they pull the latest parameters when they are ready to continue.\n\n### Key Points about Asynchronous Training\n\n- **Asynchronous Nature**: The key to asynchronous training is that workers do not synchronize with each other. Each worker operates independently and updates the parameter server as soon as its gradient computation is done. This means that different workers can be working with slightly different versions of the parameters due to the time lag in updates.\n\n- **Efficiency and Challenges**: Asynchronous training can be more efficient than synchronous training because it does not require all workers to be in sync, reducing idle time. However, it can lead to issues like stale gradients since some workers might use outdated versions of parameters to compute their updates.\n\nYour understanding of the broadcast part might be slightly off in the context of asynchronous training. The parameter server updates the parameters and workers pull the latest parameters, rather than the server broadcasting the gradients. This pull mechanism allows for more independence among workers, aligning with the asynchronous paradigm.\n\nIf you have more specific questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!"
