        "content": "Creating an algorithm to transpose a matrix in Java involves swapping the rows with columns. Here's a step-by-step guide and a sample code to help you achieve that:\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix**: A matrix is a 2D array. Transposing a matrix means converting its rows into columns and vice versa.\n\n2. **Iterate Through the Matrix**: Loop through each element of the matrix.\n\n3. **Swap Elements**: For each element at position `(i, j)`, swap it with the element at position `(j, i)`.\n\n4. **Handle Non-Square Matrices**: If the matrix is not square (i.e., the number of rows is not equal to the number of columns), you'll need to create a new matrix to hold the transposed result.\n\n### Java Code:\n\nHere's a simple Java program to transpose a matrix:\n\n```java\npublic class MatrixTranspose {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Example matrix\n        int[][] matrix = {\n            {1, 2, 3},\n            {4, 5, 6},\n            {7, 8, 9}\n        };\n\n        int rowCount = matrix.length;\n        int colCount = matrix[0].length;\n\n        // Create a new matrix to hold the transpose\n        int[][] transposedMatrix = new int[colCount][rowCount];\n\n        // Transpose the matrix\n        for (int i = 0; i < rowCount; i++) {\n            for (int j = 0; j < colCount; j++) {\n                transposedMatrix[j][i] = matrix[i][j];\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Print the transposed matrix\n        System.out.println(\"Original Matrix:\");\n        printMatrix(matrix);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Transposed Matrix:\");\n        printMatrix(transposedMatrix);\n    }\n\n    // Helper method to print matrices\n    public static void printMatrix(int[][] matrix) {\n        for (int[] row : matrix) {\n            for (int element : row) {\n                System.out.print(element + \" \");\n            }\n            System.out.println();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Matrix Initialization**: We start with an example matrix.\n- **Transposing Logic**: We loop through each element of the matrix and assign it to the new matrix at the transposed indices.\n- **Printing**: Finally, helper function `printMatrix` is used to print both the original and transposed matrices for verification.\n\nThis code will work for any input matrix, whether square or rectangular, and will correctly transpose it."
