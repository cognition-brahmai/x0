Can you provide a brief explanation and code example for each?\nSome of the commonly used software development methods in Python include Agile, Waterfall, Scrum, and Extreme Programming. \nAgile is an iterative approach that emphasizes collaboration and flexibility. Here's an example of how to implement Agile methodology in Python:\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\napp = Flask(__name__)\n@app.route('/')\ndef hello_world():\n    return 'Hello, World!'\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run()\n```\nWaterfall is a linear approach that follows a strict sequence of steps. Here's an example of how to implement Waterfall methodology in Python:\n```python\ndef step1():\n    print('Step 1')\ndef step2():\n    print('Step 2')\ndef step3():\n    print('Step 3')\nstep1()\nstep2()\nstep3()\n```\nScrum is a framework that emphasizes teamwork and continuous improvement. Here's an example of how to implement Scrum methodology in Python:\n```python\nclass TeamMember:\n    def __init__(self, name, role):\n        self.name = name\n        self.role = role\nclass Sprint:\n    def __init__(self, goal, team):\n        self.goal = goal\n        self.team = team\n    def review(self):\n        print('Sprint Review')\n    def retrospective(self):\n        print('Sprint Retrospective')\nclass ProductBacklog:\n    def __init__(self, items):\n        self.items = items\nclass SprintBacklog:\n    def __init__(self, items):\n        self.items = items\nclass UserStory:\n    def __init__(self, title, description):\n        self.title = title\n        self.description = description\nteam = [TeamMember('Alice', 'Developer'), TeamMember('Bob', 'Scrum Master'), TeamMember('Charlie', 'Product Owner')]\nproduct_backlog = ProductBacklog([UserStory('Login Page', 'Allow users to log in'), UserStory('Registration Page', 'Allow users to register')])\nsprint_backlog = SprintBacklog([UserStory('Login Page', 'Allow users to log in')])\nsprint = Sprint('Build Login Page', team)\nsprint.review()\nsprint.retrospective()\n```\nExtreme Programming is an approach that emphasizes coding and testing. Here's an example of how to implement Extreme Programming methodology in Python:\n```python\ndef test_addition():\n    assert 1 + 1 == 2\ndef test_subtraction():\n    assert 1 - 1 == 0\ndef test_multiplication():\n    assert 2 * 2 == 4\ndef test_division():\n    assert 4 / 2 == 2\ntest_addition()\ntest_subtraction()\ntest_multiplication()\ntest_division()\n```"

        "content": "Certainly! Let's delve into each of these software development methodologies with their brief explanations and code examples:\n\n1. **Agile Methodology**:\n   Agile is an iterative and incremental approach focusing on customer collaboration, flexibility, and responding to change. It emphasizes delivering small, functional bits of the software quickly.\n\n   Example:\n   ```python\n   from flask import Flask\n\n   app = Flask(__name__)\n\n   @app.route('/')\n   def hello_world():\n       return 'Hello, World!'\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       app.run()\n   ```\n\n   This example demonstrates a small, functional application using Flask, representing the Agile approach of quick iterations to deliver working software.\n\n2. **Waterfall Methodology**:\n   The Waterfall model is a sequential (non-iterative) process where progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards through phases like requirements, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.\n\n   Example:\n   ```python\n   def step1():\n       print('Step 1: Gather Requirements')\n\n   def step2():\n       print('Step 2: Design System')\n\n   def step3():\n       print('Step 3: Implement Code')\n\n   def step4():\n       print('Step 4: Test System')\n\n   step1()\n   step2()\n   step3()\n   step4()\n   ```\n\n   This example illustrates the linear steps typical in the Waterfall methodology.\n\n3. **Scrum Framework**:\n   Scrum is a framework within Agile that is used to implement Agile development. It emphasizes teamwork, accountability, and iterative progress towards a well-defined goal.\n\n   Example:\n   ```python\n   class TeamMember:\n       def __init__(self, name, role):\n           self.name = name\n           self.role = role\n\n   class Sprint:\n       def __init__(self, goal, team):\n           self.goal = goal\n           self.team = team\n\n       def review(self):\n           print('Sprint Review')\n\n       def retrospective(self):\n           print('Sprint Retrospective')\n\n   class ProductBacklog:\n       def __init__(self, items):\n           self.items = items\n\n   class SprintBacklog:\n       def __init__(self, items):\n           self.items = items\n\n   class UserStory:\n       def __init__(self, title, description):\n           self.title = title\n           self.description = description\n\n   team = [TeamMember('Alice', 'Developer'), TeamMember('Bob', 'Scrum Master'), TeamMember('Charlie', 'Product Owner')]\n   product_backlog = ProductBacklog([UserStory('Login Page', 'Allow users to log in'), UserStory('Registration Page', 'Allow users to register')])\n   sprint_backlog = SprintBacklog([UserStory('Login Page', 'Allow users to log in')])\n   sprint = Sprint('Build Login Page', team)\n   sprint.review()\n   sprint.retrospective()\n   ```\n\n   This code snippet models the Scrum framework with roles, sprints, and backlogs.\n\n4. **Extreme Programming (XP)**:\n   Extreme Programming emphasizes technical excellence and good design. It involves frequent releases in short development cycles, improving productivity, and introducing checkpoints where new customer requirements can be adopted.\n\n   Example:\n   ```python\n   def test_addition():\n       assert 1 + 1 == 2\n\n   def test_subtraction():\n       assert 1 - 1 == 0\n\n   def test_multiplication():\n       assert 2 * 2 == 4\n\n   def test_division():\n       assert 4 / 2 == 2\n\n   test_addition()\n   test_subtraction()\n   test_multiplication()\n   test_division()\n   ```\n\n   This example shows a focus on testing, which is a core practice in Extreme Programming.\n\nEach methodology has its unique strengths and is chosen based on project requirements, team structure, and other factors."
