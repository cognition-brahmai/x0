I have tried the solution of splitting it into a list by spaces and removing the last item, then reconcatenating the list but I'm struggling with the concatenation part. Here is the code I've written so far:\n\n```\ncontent = content[position-1:position+249] # Content\nwords = string.split(content, ' ')\nwords = words[len[words] -1] # Cut of the last word\n```\nCan anyone provide a code example?"

        "content": "Certainly! It looks like you are almost there. You've correctly split the text into a list of words. To remove the last word and concatenate the list back into a string, you can use the `join` method. Here is a complete example illustrating how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\ncontent = content[position-1:position+249]  # Content\nwords = content.split(' ')  # Splitting the content into words\n\n# Removing the last word\nif words:  # Check if the list is not empty\n    words.pop()\n\n# Joining the list back into a string\nmodified_content = ' '.join(words)\n\nprint(modified_content)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Splitting the Content**: `content.split(' ')` splits the text into a list of words based on spaces.\n2. **Removing the Last Word**: `words.pop()` removes the last word from the list.\n3. **Joining the List**: `' '.join(words)` concatenates the list into a single string with spaces between words.\n\nThis code first checks if the `words` list is not empty to avoid errors when trying to remove an element from an empty list. The `join` method is then used to combine the words back into a single string."
