I want to summarize the dataframe by providing a count of certain categories as well as the average sentiment score for these categories. The original dataframe is structured as follows:\n\n```\nsource    text              sent\n--------------------------------\nbar       some string       0.13\nfoo       alt string        -0.8\nbar       another str       0.7\nfoo       some text         -0.2\nfoo       more text         -0.5\n```\n\nI want to end up with a dataframe that is grouped by the text source, displaying the total count of posts and the mean sentiment score. The expected output should look like this:\n\n```\nsource    count     mean_sent\n-----------------------------\nfoo       3         -0.5\nbar       2         0.415\n```\n\nI tried using the following code:\n\n```\ndf['sent'].groupby(df['source']).mean()\n```\n\nHowever, it only gives each source and its mean, with no column headers. How can I modify my code to get the desired output?"

        "content": "To achieve your desired output, you can use the `groupby` method along with `agg` to perform multiple aggregations on your DataFrame. Specifically, you want to count the number of occurrences for each source and calculate the mean sentiment score. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'source': ['bar', 'foo', 'bar', 'foo', 'foo'],\n    'text': ['some string', 'alt string', 'another str', 'some text', 'more text'],\n    'sent': [0.13, -0.8, 0.7, -0.2, -0.5]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Group by 'source' and aggregate\nresult = df.groupby('source').agg(count=('text', 'size'), mean_sent=('sent', 'mean')).reset_index()\n\n# Display the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will give you a DataFrame with the desired structure:\n\n```\n  source  count  mean_sent\n0    bar      2      0.415\n1    foo      3     -0.500\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `groupby('source')` groups the DataFrame by the 'source' column.\n- `agg()` allows you to specify multiple aggregation functions. In this case, `'count'` is calculated using the size of the 'text' column, and `'mean_sent'` is calculated as the mean of the 'sent' column.\n- `reset_index()` is used to convert the grouped DataFrame (which has the 'source' as an index) back to a standard DataFrame with a default integer index."
