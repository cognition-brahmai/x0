If it doesn't, you can process the line. Here's a simple example to demonstrate this:\n\n```python\n# Open the file in read mode\nwith open('your_file.txt', 'r') as file:\n    for line in file:\n        # Strip the line of leading and trailing whitespace\n        stripped_line = line.strip()\n        \n        # Check if the line is not empty and does not start with a hash\n        if stripped_line and not stripped_line.startswith('#'):\n            # Process the line\n            print(stripped_line)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We use `with open('your_file.txt', 'r') as file` to open the file and ensure it gets closed automatically after reading.\n- We iterate over each line in the file using `for line in file`.\n- We use `strip()` to remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the line.\n- We check if the line is not empty and does not start with a hash using `if stripped_line and not stripped_line.startswith('#')`.\n- If the line meets the criteria, we process it (in this example, we simply print it).\n\nThis logic will skip any empty lines and lines that start with a hash, effectively ignoring comment lines."
