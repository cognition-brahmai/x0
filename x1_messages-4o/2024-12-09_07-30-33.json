        "content": "To automatically generate documentation for a Django app using Sphinx's autodoc extension, and specifically the `automodule` directive, you can follow these steps. The `automodule` directive will help you document all classes and functions in your module without needing to individually use `autoclass` or `autofunction`.\n\n### Setting Up Sphinx with autodoc\n\n1. **Install Sphinx and autodoc**: Make sure you have Sphinx installed in your environment. You can install it via pip if you haven't already:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install sphinx\n   ```\n\n2. **Configure Sphinx**: Navigate to your Django project's directory and initiate Sphinx:\n\n   ```bash\n   sphinx-quickstart\n   ```\n\n   Follow the prompts to set up your Sphinx project. Ensure that you include the autodoc extension when prompted.\n\n3. **Edit `conf.py`**: In the `conf.py` file generated by Sphinx, ensure that `sphinx.ext.autodoc` is listed in the `extensions` list:\n\n   ```python\n   extensions = [\n       'sphinx.ext.autodoc',\n       # other extensions\n   ]\n   ```\n\n   Also, make sure your Django app is on the Python path. You may need to modify `sys.path` in `conf.py` to include your project's root:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   import sys\n   sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../path_to_your_django_project'))\n   ```\n\n### Using `automodule` and Cross-Referencing\n\n4. **Create the Documentation File**: In your `index.rst` or another `.rst` file where you'd like to include the documentation for your module, use the `automodule` directive:\n\n   ```rst\n   .. automodule:: source_code\n       :members:\n       :undoc-members:\n       :show-inheritance:\n   ```\n\n   This will automatically document all classes and functions in `source_code.py`.\n\n5. **Cross-Reference Classes**: To create internal references to different classes within the same module, you can use the `:ref:` role with the appropriate reference label. Sphinx automatically generates labels for each documented object using the format `module.class` or `module.function`. For your example, `A` would have the label `source_code.A`.\n\n   Therefore, in your class `B`, you can reference class `A` like this:\n\n   ```python\n   class B:\n       \"\"\"docs for B with \n       :ref:`internal reference to A <source_code.A>`\n       \"\"\"\n       pass\n   ```\n\n6. **Build the Documentation**: Run the `make` command to build your documentation:\n\n   ```bash\n   make html\n   ```\n\n   This generates the HTML documentation where you can see your classes and their references.\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- **Explicit Targets**: If you want to be more explicit or organize your documentation better, you can define custom labels using the `.. _label-name:` syntax before a class or section and reference them accordingly.\n\n- **Check Sphinx Output**: If the references don't work as expected, check the build output for warnings or errors that might indicate issues with missing references or other configuration problems.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to generate comprehensive documentation for your Django app using Sphinx's autodoc and create internal references between classes seamlessly."
