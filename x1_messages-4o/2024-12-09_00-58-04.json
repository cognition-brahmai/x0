However, the compilers I have used (gcc, g++, and MSVC) have shown varied results. GCC throws a warning, g++ throws an error, but MSVC does not produce any warnings even with /Wall specified. \n\nAdditionally, when I explicitly cast `a = (void **)b`, none of these compilers throw a warning. I thought this should be an invalid cast, so why wouldn't there be any warnings?\n\nWhile learning CUDA, I came across some code in the official Programming Guide which performs an implicit conversion to `void **` for `&d_A` as shown below:\n\n```c\n// Allocate vectors in device memory\nfloat* d_A;\ncudaMalloc(&d_A, size);\n```\n\nThe first argument of `cudaMalloc` is of type `void **`. Is this just sloppy work on NVIDIA's end or am I missing something here? Since `nvcc` uses MSVC, the code compiles without warnings."

        "content": "The behavior you're observing with conversions to `void **` across different compilers can indeed be confusing, and it highlights some of the subtleties in C and C++ pointer conversions, as well as differences in compiler implementations.\n\n### Understanding `void **` Conversion\n\n1. **Pointer Type Safety**: \n   - In C, `void *` is a generic pointer type, which means you can convert any data pointer to and from `void *` without an explicit cast. However, this does not extend to `void **`. The reason is that `void **` is a pointer to a pointer, and converting `T **` to `void **` can lead to type safety issues because it implies that the structure of the underlying data is unknown, which can lead to undefined behavior if not used carefully.\n   \n2. **Compiler Behavior**:\n   - **GCC**: Issues a warning because it recognizes that `void **` is not a generic pointer, and converting `float **` to `void **` might lead to problems if the memory layout assumptions are mismatched.\n   - **G++**: Throws an error due to stricter type checking in C++ compared to C.\n   - **MSVC**: Does not produce warnings in this case, which might be due to less aggressive type checking or differences in how it handles conversions.\n\n3. **Explicit Cast**:\n   - When you explicitly cast `(void **)b`, you're essentially telling the compiler \"I know what I'm doing,\" and therefore, many compilers won't warn you about it. This is because the explicit cast suppresses the compiler's type checking.\n\n### CUDA and `cudaMalloc`\n\n- In the case of `cudaMalloc`, NVIDIA decided to use a `void **` for the first argument to allow the function to modify the pointer itself to point to the allocated memory, similar to how `malloc` works with a single pointer. However, this requires casting when using it, which can be seen in the CUDA example.\n  \n- **Why No Warning in NVCC with MSVC**: \n  - NVCC, when compiling CUDA code, might not enforce strict type checking for the host part, or MSVC might handle this conversion without warning due to its specific handling of `void **`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The use of `void **` in CUDA is a design choice. It works in practice because the CUDA API and most host compilers, like MSVC, are designed to handle this without complaints, although it's not strictly type-safe according to C/C++ standards.\n  \n- When working with different compilers, always be cautious with pointer conversions and be aware of compiler-specific behaviors. Using explicit casts can help, but they also shift the responsibility to you to ensure correctness.\n\n- It is generally good practice to follow the language's type safety rules and to use explicit casts judiciously to avoid potential pitfalls."
