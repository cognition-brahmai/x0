Here's an example of how you might write such a script:\n\n```ruby\n# Define the main characters and their attributes\ncharacters = {\n  \"Jack Dawson\" => {\n    actor: \"Leonardo DiCaprio\",\n    famous_declaration: \"I'm king of the world\",\n    engaged_to: nil,\n    narrator: false\n  },\n  \"Rose DeWitt Bukater\" => {\n    actor: \"Kate Winslet\",\n    famous_declaration: nil,\n    engaged_to: \"Cal Hockley\",\n    narrator: true\n  },\n  \"Cal Hockley\" => {\n    actor: \"Billy Zane\",\n    famous_declaration: nil,\n    engaged_to: \"Rose DeWitt Bukater\",\n    narrator: false\n  },\n  \"Old Rose\" => {\n    actor: \"Gloria Stuart\",\n    famous_declaration: nil,\n    engaged_to: nil,\n    narrator: true\n  }\n}\n\n# 1. Which two main characters share the same first letter in their first names?\ndef characters_with_same_initial(characters)\n  initials = Hash.new { |hash, key| hash[key] = [] }\n  characters.each_key do |name|\n    initials[name[0]] << name\n  end\n  initials.select { |_, names| names.size > 1 }\nend\n\n# 2. How many letters are in the full name of the character who famously declares \"I'm king of the world\"?\ndef length_of_name_with_declaration(characters)\n  characters.each do |name, attributes|\n    return name.length if attributes[:famous_declaration]\n  end\nend\n\n# 3. Which main character is portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio?\ndef character_by_actor(characters, actor_name)\n  characters.each do |name, attributes|\n    return name if attributes[:actor] == actor_name\n  end\nend\n\n# 4. Name the character who is engaged to the wealthy Cal Hockley.\ndef character_engaged_to(characters, engaged_to_name)\n  characters.each do |name, attributes|\n    return name if attributes[:engaged_to] == engaged_to_name\n  end\nend\n\n# 5. Who is the main character who narrates the story as an elderly woman in the present day?\ndef narrator_character(characters)\n  characters.each do |name, attributes|\n    return name if attributes[:narrator]\n  end\nend\n\n# Execute the functions to get the answers\nputs \"1. Characters with the same initial: #{characters_with_same_initial(characters)}\"\nputs \"2. Letters in name of character declaring 'I'm king of the world': #{length_of_name_with_declaration(characters)}\"\nputs \"3. Character portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio: #{character_by_actor(characters, 'Leonardo DiCaprio')}\"\nputs \"4. Character engaged to Cal Hockley: #{character_engaged_to(characters, 'Cal Hockley')}\"\nputs \"5. Main character narrating the story: #{narrator_character(characters)}\"\n```\n\nThis script defines a hash of characters, each with attributes that are relevant to the questions. Then, it defines functions to extract the needed information and prints the answers. You can run this Ruby script to get the answers to your questions."
