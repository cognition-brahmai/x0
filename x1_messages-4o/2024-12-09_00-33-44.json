The error message is: \"Error in confusionMatrix.default(pred, testing$Final): the data and reference factors must have the same number of levels\". This error occurs when generating the confusion matrix. The levels are the same on both objects but I still can't figure out the problem. The structure and levels of both objects are provided below:\n\n```r\n> str(pred)\nchr [1:148] \"85\" \"84\" \"87\" \"65\" \"88\" \"84\" \"82\" \"84\" \"65\" \"78\" \"78\" \"88\" \"85\"  \n\"86\" \"77\" ...\n> str(testing$Final)\nint [1:148] 88 85 86 70 85 85 79 85 62 77 ...\n\n> levels(pred)\nNULL\n> levels(testing$Final)\nNULL\n```\n\nHere is the code I'm using:\n\n```r\nEnglishMarks <- read.csv(\"E:/Subject Wise Data/EnglishMarks.csv\", header=TRUE)\ninTrain<-createDataPartition(y=EnglishMarks$Final,p=0.7,list=FALSE)\ntraining<-EnglishMarks[inTrain,]\ntesting<-EnglishMarks[-inTrain,]\npredictionsTree <- predict(treeFit, testdata)\nconfusionMatrix(predictionsTree, testdata$catgeory)\nmodFit<-train(Final~UT1+UT2+HalfYearly+UT3+UT4,method=\"lm\",data=training)\npred<-format(round(predict(modFit,testing)))              \nconfusionMatrix(pred,testing$Final)\n```\n\nAny guidance on what could be the cause of this error would be greatly appreciated."

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the `confusionMatrix` function in R expects both `pred` and `testing$Final` to be factors with the same levels. However, from your data structures, `pred` is a character vector and `testing$Final` is an integer vector, and neither has levels.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you should convert both `pred` and `testing$Final` to factors with the same levels before passing them to `confusionMatrix`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Convert `testing$Final` to a factor with levels based on its unique values.\n2. Convert `pred` to a factor with the same levels as `testing$Final`.\n\nHere's the updated code:\n\n```r\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(caret)\n\n# Read data and prepare train-test split\nEnglishMarks <- read.csv(\"E:/Subject Wise Data/EnglishMarks.csv\", header=TRUE)\ninTrain <- createDataPartition(y=EnglishMarks$Final, p=0.7, list=FALSE)\ntraining <- EnglishMarks[inTrain,]\ntesting <- EnglishMarks[-inTrain,]\n\n# Train the model\nmodFit <- train(Final ~ UT1 + UT2 + HalfYearly + UT3 + UT4, method=\"lm\", data=training)\n\n# Make predictions\npred <- predict(modFit, testing)\npred <- format(round(pred))\n\n# Convert predictions and actual values to factors\ntesting$Final <- as.factor(testing$Final)\npred <- factor(pred, levels = levels(testing$Final))\n\n# Generate confusion matrix\nconfusionMatrix(pred, testing$Final)\n```\n\nMake sure that the levels of `pred` and `testing$Final` match exactly. If `testing$Final` contains levels that are not present in `pred`, you might want to manually set the levels for both to the unique values present in `testing$Final`.  \n\nAfter implementing these changes, the confusion matrix should be generated without any errors."
