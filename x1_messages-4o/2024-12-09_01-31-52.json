        "content": "The error message you're encountering indicates that the object returned by the `fit` method from statsmodels is not compatible with scikit-learn's `cross_val_score` function because it doesn't implement the expected interface required by scikit-learn estimators.\n\nScikit-learn estimators are expected to have a consistent interface, which includes methods like `fit`, `predict`, `score`, etc. However, statsmodels focuses more on statistical tests and models, and its objects often do not follow this interface directly.\n\nTo use a statsmodels model with scikit-learn's `cross_val_score`, you can create a wrapper or a custom class that implements the required methods. Here's an example of how you could wrap a statsmodels model:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin\nimport numpy as np\n\nclass StatsModelsWrapper(BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin):\n    def __init__(self, model_class, **model_kwargs):\n        self.model_class = model_class\n        self.model_kwargs = model_kwargs\n        self.model_ = None\n\n    def fit(self, X, y):\n        # Statsmodels usually want a constant added for the intercept\n        import statsmodels.api as sm\n        X = sm.add_constant(X)\n        self.model_ = self.model_class(y, X, **self.model_kwargs).fit()\n        return self\n\n    def predict(self, X):\n        X = sm.add_constant(X)\n        return (self.model_.predict(X) > 0.5).astype(int)\n\n    def score(self, X, y):\n        from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n        return accuracy_score(y, self.predict(X))\n\n# Example usage with Logistic Regression\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\n\n# Load some data\niris = load_iris()\nX, y = iris.data, iris.target\n\n# Use only two classes for binary classification\nX, y = X[y != 2], y[y != 2]\n\n# Wrap the statsmodels logistic regression\nwrapped_model = StatsModelsWrapper(sm.Logit)\n\n# Perform cross-validation\nscores = cross_val_score(wrapped_model, X, y, cv=5)\n\nprint(\"Cross-validation scores:\", scores)\n```\n\nThis wrapper class takes a statsmodels model class and its parameters, fits the model, and provides the `predict` and `score` methods needed for scikit-learn compatibility. You can modify the `predict` method based on your specific model's requirements, such as the threshold for classification."
