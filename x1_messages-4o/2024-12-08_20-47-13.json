Here is the code to do that:\n\n```javascript\nlet numbers = [5, 1, 3, 8, 9];\n\n// Using the sort function with a compare function for numerical sorting\nnumbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);\n\nconsole.log(numbers); // Output will be [1, 3, 5, 8, 9]\n```\n\nThe `sort()` method by default sorts elements as strings, which can lead to incorrect results when sorting numbers. Therefore, it's important to provide a compare function `(a, b) => a - b` to ensure the numbers are sorted correctly in ascending order."
