However, in order to prevent animals from entering the vegetable garden, they need to create a fence that is 2 meters wide around the vegetable garden. In addition to calculating the perimeter of the entire section, the person now wants to ensure that the fence is made up of two different materials, with one material being used for the outer 1 meter of the fence and the other material being used for the inner 1 meter of the fence. How much fencing material of each type will they need to purchase?"

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the perimeter of both the outer fence and the inner fence, and then determine how much of each type of fencing material is needed.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the dimensions of the outer and inner fence boundaries\n\n1. **Outer Fence Boundary:**\n   - The vegetable garden is 6 meters long and 4 meters wide.\n   - The fence is 2 meters wide around the garden.\n   - Therefore, the dimensions of the outer boundary of the fence are:\n     - Length: \\(6 + 2 \\times 2 = 10\\) meters\n     - Width: \\(4 + 2 \\times 2 = 8\\) meters\n\n2. **Inner Fence Boundary:**\n   - Since the inner 1 meter of the fence is separate from the outer 1 meter, the dimensions of the inner fence boundary are:\n     - Length: \\(6 + 1 \\times 2 = 8\\) meters\n     - Width: \\(4 + 1 \\times 2 = 6\\) meters\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the perimeter of the outer and inner fence boundaries\n\n1. **Perimeter of the Outer Fence Boundary:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Width}) = 2 \\times (10 + 8) = 36 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Perimeter of the Inner Fence Boundary:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Perimeter} = 2 \\times (\\text{Length} + \\text{Width}) = 2 \\times (8 + 6) = 28 \\text{ meters}\n   \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the amount of each type of fencing material needed\n\n- **Outer Material:** This will cover the perimeter of the outer fence boundary.\n  - Amount needed: 36 meters\n\n- **Inner Material:** This will cover the perimeter of the inner fence boundary.\n  - Amount needed: 28 meters\n\nTherefore, the person will need to purchase 36 meters of the outer fencing material and 28 meters of the inner fencing material."
