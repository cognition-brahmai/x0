        "content": "To create a Rails model to store tasks with `name` and `description` fields, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Generate the Model:**\n   Use the Rails generator to create a model for `Task`. This will also create a migration file for setting up the database table.\n\n   ```bash\n   rails generate model Task name:string description:text\n   ```\n\n   This command will generate a model file `task.rb` in the `app/models` directory and a migration file in the `db/migrate` directory.\n\n2. **Run the Migration:**\n   Migrate the database to create the `tasks` table with the specified columns.\n\n   ```bash\n   rails db:migrate\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify the Model:**\n   Check the generated model file `app/models/task.rb`. By default, it should look something like this:\n\n   ```ruby\n   class Task < ApplicationRecord\n   end\n   ```\n\n   You can add validations and other logic to this file as needed.\n\n4. **Use the Model:**\n   You can now use the `Task` model to interact with the `tasks` table. Here are a few examples of how you might use it:\n\n   - Create a new task:\n     ```ruby\n     task = Task.new(name: \"Example Task\", description: \"This is an example description.\")\n     task.save\n     ```\n\n   - Find a task:\n     ```ruby\n     task = Task.find(1)\n     ```\n\n   - Update a task:\n     ```ruby\n     task = Task.find(1)\n     task.update(name: \"Updated Task Name\")\n     ```\n\n   - Delete a task:\n     ```ruby\n     task = Task.find(1)\n     task.destroy\n     ```\n\nWith these steps, you've created a Rails model for tasks with `name` and `description` fields, and you can now manage tasks in your Rails application."
