        "content": "In SQLAlchemy, you can catch all exceptions related to database operations by using the `SQLAlchemyError` class. This is the base class for all SQLAlchemy exceptions, and by catching it, you can handle any exception that is raised by SQLAlchemy. Here's an example of how you can use it:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy.exc import SQLAlchemyError\n\ntry:\n    # Your database operation here\n    pass\nexcept SQLAlchemyError as e:\n    # Handle the exception\n    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n```\n\nBy catching `SQLAlchemyError`, you ensure that you can handle any kind of database-related error that might occur in your application."
