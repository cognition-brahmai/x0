I am aware that it's possible to determine the memory usage of a block of code, but I am specifically interested in the memory usage of individual objects."

        "content": "In Python, you can determine the memory usage of an individual object using the `sys.getsizeof()` function from the `sys` module. This function returns the size of an object in bytes. However, it's important to note that `sys.getsizeof()` only returns the memory consumed by the object itself, not the memory consumed by objects it refers to if it's a container (like a list or dictionary).\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Define a sample object\nmy_object = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# Get the size of the object in bytes\nsize_in_bytes = sys.getsizeof(my_object)\n\nprint(f\"Memory size of my_object: {size_in_bytes} bytes\")\n```\n\nFor more comprehensive memory profiling of an object, including the memory used by objects it refers to, you might want to use the `pympler` library, which provides more detailed information:\n\n```bash\npip install pympler\n```\n\nHere is an example using `pympler`:\n\n```python\nfrom pympler import asizeof\n\n# Define a sample object\nmy_object = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# Get the total memory size of the object in bytes, including references\ntotal_size_in_bytes = asizeof.asizeof(my_object)\n\nprint(f\"Total memory size of my_object: {total_size_in_bytes} bytes\")\n```\n\nBy using `pympler`, you can get a more accurate representation of the total memory footprint of an object, especially if it contains nested objects."
