Here's the script, named test.sh:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nSTR = \"Hello World\"\necho $STR\n```\n\nWhen I execute it using `sh test.sh`, I see the following error message:\n\n```bash\ntest.sh: line 2: STR: command not found\n```\n\nI've been referring to basic bash scripting tutorials and it seems the way I'm declaring variables is correct. Could anyone explain why I'm experiencing this error? I'm using Ubuntu Server 9.10 and bash is located at `/bin/bash`."

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the spaces around the `=` sign in your variable assignment. In bash, spaces are not allowed around the `=` when you're assigning a value to a variable. Here's how you can fix your script:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nSTR=\"Hello World\"\necho $STR\n```\n\nBy removing the spaces around the `=`, the script should work correctly.\n\nAlso, note that you should execute your script with `bash test.sh` or `./test.sh` (after making it executable with `chmod +x test.sh`), rather than using `sh test.sh`. This is because `sh` might not necessarily point to bash, and could potentially lead to other compatibility issues."
