For instance, with the code `print(42 + 42)`, `print(type(list))`, and `print(datetime.now())`, I want it to print the expressions as well as their results, like `42 + 42 : 84`, `type(list) : <class 'type'>`, and `datetime.now() : 2019-08-15 22:43:57.805861`. I've tried to override builtin print, but without success:\n```\nimport builtins\ndef print(*args, **kwargs):\n    return builtins.print(*args, **kwargs)  # passed expression isn't available here as string!\n```\nHow can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired functionality where the expression and its result are printed together, you need to use a custom function that captures the expression as a string and evaluates it. One way to achieve this is by using Python's `eval()` function along with a custom `debug_print` function. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport builtins\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef debug_print(expression, globals=None, locals=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the expression and its evaluated result.\n    \n    Args:\n        expression (str): The expression to evaluate and print.\n        globals (dict): Optional. A dictionary to specify the global context.\n        locals (dict): Optional. A dictionary to specify the local context.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Evaluate the expression and get the result\n        result = eval(expression, globals, locals)\n        # Print the expression and its result\n        builtins.print(f\"{expression} : {result}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        builtins.print(f\"Error evaluating {expression}: {e}\")\n\n# Example usage:\ndebug_print(\"42 + 42\")\ndebug_print(\"type(list)\")\ndebug_print(\"datetime.now()\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Custom Function**: We define a function `debug_print` that takes an expression as a string.\n\n2. **Evaluation**: Inside the function, we use `eval()` to evaluate the expression in the provided global and local contexts (if any). This allows you to evaluate the expression dynamically.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: We use a `try-except` block to handle any potential errors during evaluation (e.g., syntax errors).\n\n4. **Usage**: You can call `debug_print` with the expression as a string. This function will then print both the expression and its evaluated result.\n\nThis approach allows you to easily debug your code by seeing both the expression being evaluated and its result. Make sure to use this cautiously, especially with untrusted input, as `eval()` can execute arbitrary code."
