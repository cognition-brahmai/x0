        "content": "In Python, the `%` operator is used for string formatting when it is placed on the left-hand side of a string. This is often referred to as the \"old-style\" string formatting or interpolation.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **String Interpolation**: The `%` operator allows you to embed values into a string by using format specifiers. These specifiers are placeholders within the string, and they start with a `%` symbol followed by a character that represents the type of value you want to format and insert. \n\n2. **Format Specifiers**: Common format specifiers include:\n   - `%s`: String or any object with a `str()` method.\n   - `%d`: Integer.\n   - `%f`: Floating-point number.\n   - `%x`: Hexadecimal integer.\n\n3. **Usage Example**:\n   ```python\n   name = \"Alice\"\n   age = 30\n   formatted_string = \"Name: %s, Age: %d\" % (name, age)\n   print(formatted_string)\n   ```\n   In this example, `%s` is replaced by the string \"Alice\", and `%d` is replaced by the integer `30`.\n\n4. **Tuple for Multiple Values**: When you have multiple format specifiers in the string, you need to pass a tuple of values that correspond to each format specifier.\n\n5. **Single Value**: If there's only one format specifier, you can directly pass the value without a tuple.\n\nAlthough the `%` operator for string formatting is still supported in Python, it's worth noting that there are more modern and preferred methods for string formatting, such as the `str.format()` method and f-strings (formatted string literals) introduced in Python 3.6.\n\nHere's an example using f-strings:\n\n```python\nname = \"Alice\"\nage = 30\nformatted_string = f\"Name: {name}, Age: {age}\"\nprint(formatted_string)\n```\n\nF-strings are generally more readable and concise, and they offer more functionality than the `%` operator."
