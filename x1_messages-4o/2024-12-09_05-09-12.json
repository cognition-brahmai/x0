The script fails to run and crashes with a `SyntaxError` pointing to the comment at the beginning of `launch.json`. The `launch.json` file is as follows:\n\n```\n{\n    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.\n    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.\n    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n    \"configurations\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Python | Default\",\n            \"type\": \"python\",\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\n            \"stopOnEntry\": false,\n            \"pythonPath\": \"${config:python.pythonPath}\",\n            \"program\": \"${file}\",\n            \"cwd\": \"${workspaceFolder}\",\n            \"env\": {},\n            \"envFile\": \"${workspaceFolder}/.env\",\n            \"debugOptions\": [\n                \"RedirectOutput\"\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nWhen I try to run it, I get the following error in the terminal:\n\n```\nFile \".../.vscode/launch.json\", line 2\n    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.\n     ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n```\n\nMy `settings.json` is as follows:\n\n```\n{\n    \"python.pythonPath\": \"${workspaceFolder}/venv/bin/python\"\n}\n```\n\nThis worked perfectly fine on my Windows machine. However, on my macOS, it seems VSCode is trying to run the `launch.json` file through Python and `//` is an invalid comment syntax in Python. If I remove the comments, I get another error and if I use Python's `False`, the script doesn't crash but nothing happens and my script does not run. It seems `launch.json` is being parsed by Python erroneously. How can I fix this issue?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is likely due to a misconfiguration in your VSCode setup, causing it to attempt to run the `launch.json` file as a Python script. The `launch.json` file is meant for configuring the debugger and should not be executed as a Python script.\n\nHere are some steps to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check the Run Configuration:**\n   Ensure that you're running the correct file. When you execute your script, make sure you are selecting the Python script file you want to run, not `launch.json`.\n\n2. **Select the Correct Interpreter:**\n   Make sure VSCode is using the correct Python interpreter. You can do this by opening the command palette (`Cmd + Shift + P`), then typing and selecting \"Python: Select Interpreter\". Choose the interpreter located in your virtual environment (`${workspaceFolder}/venv/bin/python`).\n\n3. **Check File Associations:**\n   Sometimes file associations can be misconfigured. Go to VSCode settings and ensure `.json` files are not associated with Python. You can do this by searching for \"files.associations\" in the settings and ensuring there's no entry linking `launch.json` to Python.\n\n4. **Debug Configuration:**\n   Verify that the debug configuration is set up correctly:\n   - Open the \"Run and Debug\" side panel (using the shortcut `Cmd + Shift + D`).\n   - Click on \"create a launch.json file\" link if it prompts for a configuration.\n   - Ensure that the correct configuration is selected for debugging. You might need to manually create or edit the `launch.json` to ensure it points to the correct Python script.\n\n5. **Reinstall VSCode Python Extension:**\n   If the above steps don't resolve the issue, try uninstalling and reinstalling the Python extension for VSCode. This can sometimes reset any misconfigurations.\n\n6. **VSCode Update:**\n   Ensure that you are using the latest version of VSCode and the Python extension. Sometimes bugs are fixed in newer updates.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and run your Python scripts smoothly on macOS using VSCode. If the problem persists, consider checking for any other extensions or settings that might interfere with the file execution process."
