I am using Tensorflow's iris_training model with some of my own data and I keep getting an error that states \"Model diverged with loss = NaN.\" This error originates from the following line of code: \n```python\ntf.contrib.learn.DNNClassifier(feature_columns=feature_columns,\n                               hidden_units=[300, 300, 300],\n                               n_classes=11,\n                               model_dir=\"/tmp/iris_model\")\n```\nI've tried adjusting the optimizer, using a zero for learning rate, and using no optimizer. Could you provide some insights into network layers, data size, etc?"

        "content": "When a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or any neural network diverges during training, resulting in a loss of `NaN`, there could be several underlying issues. Here are some common causes and potential solutions you might consider:\n\n1. **Learning Rate**: If your learning rate is too high, it can cause the gradient updates to overshoot, leading to divergence. Ensure that the learning rate is set to a reasonable value. You might want to try a smaller learning rate, such as 0.001 or even lower.\n\n2. **Data Preprocessing**: Ensure that your input data is properly normalized or standardized. Features with very different scales can lead to instability during training.\n\n3. **Initialization of Weights**: Poor initialization of weights can also lead to divergence. Ensure that you're using a proper initialization method like Xavier/Glorot or He initialization depending on your activation functions.\n\n4. **Activation Functions**: Some activation functions are more prone to causing issues like the vanishing/exploding gradient problem. For deeper networks, consider using activation functions like ReLU or its variants (Leaky ReLU, Parametric ReLU) which are generally more stable.\n\n5. **Gradient Clipping**: Implement gradient clipping to prevent the gradients from becoming too large, which can lead to instability.\n\n6. **Batch Size**: A very small batch size might lead to noisy gradient estimates, while a very large batch size might not generalize well. Experiment with different batch sizes to see what works best for your data.\n\n7. **Check Your Data**: Make sure there are no NaNs or infinite values in your dataset. Such values can propagate through the network and result in NaN losses.\n\n8. **Network Architecture**: Evaluate the complexity of your network. A very deep or wide network might require more careful tuning of hyperparameters. Try simplifying the architecture to see if the problem persists.\n\n9. **Regularization**: Implement regularization techniques like L2 regularization or dropout to prevent overfitting and stabilize training.\n\n10. **Numerical Stability**: Sometimes, operations like exponentiation or division can lead to numerical instability. Ensure that your operations are numerically stable.\n\nSince you're using `tf.contrib.learn.DNNClassifier`, consider switching to a more up-to-date API if possible, as `contrib` has been deprecated in TensorFlow 2.x. The modern `tf.keras` API provides more flexibility and better support for debugging.\n\nTry these approaches and see if they help stabilize the training of your network. If the issue persists, consider simplifying the problem further and gradually reintroducing complexity to identify the root cause."
