For instance, if I start with the decimal integer 65, I want to convert it to binary (01000001), reverse the bits (10000010), and then convert back to decimal, resulting in 130. I understand that this process involves three steps: convert the decimal integer to binary representation, reverse the bits, and convert back to decimal. However, I am having difficulties with the first step, as I need to ensure that the full binary representation of the decimal is obtained, including leading zeroes."

Convert the decimal integer to a binary representation.\n2. Reverse the bits of the binary representation.\n3. Convert the reversed binary representation back to a decimal integer.\n\nHere's how you can do this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_bits(n, num_bits):\n    # Convert the integer to binary and remove the '0b' prefix\n    binary_representation = format(n, '0' + str(num_bits) + 'b')\n    \n    # Reverse the binary string\n    reversed_binary = binary_representation[::-1]\n    \n    # Convert the reversed binary string back to a decimal integer\n    reversed_decimal = int(reversed_binary, 2)\n    \n    return reversed_decimal\n\n# Example usage:\ndecimal_number = 65\n# Assuming we are dealing with 8 bits for the representation\nnum_bits = 8\nreversed_decimal = reverse_bits(decimal_number, num_bits)\nprint(reversed_decimal)  # Output should be 130\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Step 1:** The `format()` function is used to convert the decimal integer to a binary string with leading zeroes. The `format(n, '0' + str(num_bits) + 'b')` ensures that the binary string has a fixed length of `num_bits`. In this example, we used 8 bits, which is the typical length for a byte.\n\n- **Step 2:** The slicing operation `[::-1]` is used to reverse the binary string.\n\n- **Step 3:** The `int()` function with base 2 converts the reversed binary string back to a decimal integer.\n\nThis process ensures that you account for leading zeroes in the binary representation, which is important for accurately reversing the bits. Adjust `num_bits` as needed for your specific use case."
