        "content": "In Python, if you want to use a global variable inside a function, you need to declare it as `global` within the function. This tells Python that you are referring to the global variable, not creating a new local one. Here\u2019s a simple example to demonstrate how to define and use a global variable across multiple functions:\n\n```python\n# Define a global variable\nglobal_variable = 10\n\ndef function_one():\n    global global_variable  # Declare the use of global variable\n    global_variable += 5    # Modify the global variable\n    print(\"Inside function_one:\", global_variable)\n\ndef function_two():\n    global global_variable  # Declare the use of global variable\n    global_variable *= 2    # Modify the global variable\n    print(\"Inside function_two:\", global_variable)\n\n# Call the functions\nfunction_one()\nfunction_two()\n\n# Access the global variable outside the functions\nprint(\"Outside functions:\", global_variable)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Declaration**: Use the `global` keyword inside a function to tell Python you want to use the global variable. Without this, Python assumes you are creating a new local variable with the same name, leading to potential `UnboundLocalError` if you try to modify it before declaration.\n\n2. **Modification**: Once declared as global within the function, any changes made to the variable will affect the global variable.\n\n3. **Function Scope**: If you only need to read the global variable inside a function and not modify it, you don't need to declare it as `global`.\n\nHere\u2019s an example illustrating a read-only scenario:\n\n```python\n# Define a global variable\nglobal_variable = 10\n\ndef function_read():\n    # No need for 'global' since we're not modifying the variable\n    print(\"Inside function_read:\", global_variable)\n\nfunction_read()\n```\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can effectively manage global variables across multiple functions without encountering `UnboundLocalError`."
