        "content": "In Python, I am looking for a simple way to have a script wait until a certain number of conditions become true. I am aware that I can create my own eventing using condition variables, but I want to avoid that level of complexity as some object property changes are coming from an external thread in a wrapped C++ library (Boost.Python). In this case, I am unable to just modify `__setattr__` in a class and insert a condition variable. So, I'm left with two options: either attempt to create and signal a Python condition variable from C++, or wrap a native one and wait on it in Python. Both these options seem unnecessarily complex and tedious. Is there a simpler method to achieve this, without continuously polling the condition? Ideally, the solution would look something like this:\n\n```python\nres = wait_until(lambda: some_predicate, timeout)\nif (not res):\n    print 'timed out'\n```"

        "content": "To achieve the functionality you're asking for without continuously polling and without delving into complex threading or condition variables, you can use Python's `threading.Event`. The idea is to use this event to signal when a condition becomes true. You can set up a separate thread to monitor the condition and set the event when the condition is met. Here's an example of how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport threading\nimport time\n\ndef wait_until(predicate, timeout):\n    event = threading.Event()\n\n    def monitor():\n        while not predicate():\n            time.sleep(0.1)  # Sleep for a short time to prevent busy-waiting\n        event.set()\n\n    monitor_thread = threading.Thread(target=monitor)\n    monitor_thread.start()\n\n    result = event.wait(timeout)\n    monitor_thread.join()  # Ensure the thread finishes execution\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\ncondition_met = False\n\ndef some_predicate():\n    # Replace this with your actual condition\n    return condition_met\n\n# Simulate an external change that satisfies the condition\ndef change_condition():\n    global condition_met\n    time.sleep(2)  # Simulate some delay\n    condition_met = True\n\n# Start a thread to change the condition after some delay\nchanger_thread = threading.Thread(target=change_condition)\nchanger_thread.start()\n\nres = wait_until(some_predicate, 5)\nif not res:\n    print('Timed out')\nelse:\n    print('Condition met')\n\nchanger_thread.join()  # Ensure the changer thread finishes execution\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Event Object**: `threading.Event()` provides a simple way to communicate between threads. In this setup, it's used to signal when the condition becomes true.\n- **Predicate Monitoring**: A separate thread is used to continuously check the predicate.\n- **Graceful Waiting**: The `event.wait(timeout)` function waits for the event to be set or until the timeout is reached.\n- **Avoiding Busy-Waiting**: A small sleep interval (`time.sleep(0.1)`) is used in the monitoring loop to reduce CPU usage.\n\nThis approach provides a simple and efficient way to wait for a condition without continuous polling and without complex synchronization mechanisms."
