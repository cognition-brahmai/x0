I've managed to make the example run under Python3, but I have not used async def or yield from. I would like to add the appropriate type annotations for the generators. My current code runs properly and also typechecks, but I'm certain that I can improve on using the Generator base class in the type specs, just as I did for the Callable. I understand that the Generator takes 3 type parameters (Generator[A,B,C]), but I am unsure how to specify them in this case. Any advice would be much appreciated."

        "content": "To correctly annotate Python functions that use `yield`, you'll want to use the `Generator` type from the `typing` module. The `Generator` type takes three type parameters:\n\n1. `Y`: The type of values yielded by the generator.\n2. `S`: The type of values that can be sent to the generator using the `send()` method.\n3. `R`: The type of value returned when the generator terminates.\n\nTo help you determine the correct type annotations for your specific use case, let's break it down with an example. Suppose you have a generator function defined as follows:\n\n```python\ndef my_generator() -> Generator[int, None, None]:\n    for i in range(5):\n        yield i\n```\n\nIn this simple example:\n- The generator yields `int` values, so `Y` is `int`.\n- The generator does not expect any value to be sent to it, so `S` is `None`.\n- The generator does not return any value upon completion, so `R` is `None`.\n\nFor your state machine coroutine, you'll need to analyze the specific behavior of your generator:\n\n1. **Values Yielded (Y)**: What type of values does your generator yield? This will be the first type parameter.\n2. **Values Sent (S)**: What type of values, if any, does your generator accept when calling `send()`? If you don't use `send()`, this will be `None`.\n3. **Return Value (R)**: When your generator returns (using the `return` statement), what type of value does it return? If it does not return a value, this will be `None`.\n\nHere's a more elaborate example considering these aspects:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Generator\n\ndef state_machine() -> Generator[str, int, None]:\n    value = yield \"start\"\n    while value < 10:\n        value = yield f\"current value: {value}\"\n    yield \"done\"\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The generator yields `str` values (e.g., \"start\", \"current value: ...\", \"done\").\n- The generator accepts `int` values via `send()`.\n- The generator does not return a value upon completion.\n\nTo apply this to your code, you'll need to consider the specific values yielded, values sent, and return values in your state machine coroutine. Once you've identified these, you can appropriately annotate your generator functions."
