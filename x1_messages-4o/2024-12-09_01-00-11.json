However, I'm encountering a ValueError: '-' is a bad directive in format '%-m-%d-%y %-H:%M:%S'. I'm assuming it's referring to the dashes placed before the 'm', 'd' and 'H' because they're non-zero-padded decimals. My original date strings look like this: '12-5-2016 3:27:58 PM'. Here is the code I'm using: \n\n```python\nfor key in duplicates_set.keys():\n    attempt_dates = [datetime.strptime(attempt['Attempt Date'], \"%-m-%-d-%y %-H:%M:%S\") for attempt in duplicates_set[key]]\n```\n\nWhy am I receiving this error and how can I correct it?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the use of the `%-` directive in your date format string. The `%-` directive is used to specify parsing or formatting of numbers without zero-padding, but it is not universally supported across all platforms, especially on Windows.\n\nTo address this, you'll need to adjust your format string to be compatible across platforms. In your case, you should use `%m`, `%d`, and `%y` without the `-` to handle both zero-padded and non-zero-padded numbers. Additionally, you'll need to handle the \"AM/PM\" part of the time string using `%p`. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nfor key in duplicates_set.keys():\n    attempt_dates = [datetime.strptime(attempt['Attempt Date'], \"%m-%d-%Y %I:%M:%S %p\") for attempt in duplicates_set[key]]\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the format string:\n\n- `%m`: Month as a zero-padded decimal number (01 to 12).\n- `%d`: Day of the month as a zero-padded decimal number (01 to 31).\n- `%Y`: Year with century as a decimal number.\n- `%I`: Hour (12-hour clock) as a zero-padded decimal number (01 to 12).\n- `%M`: Minute as a zero-padded decimal number (00 to 59).\n- `%S`: Second as a zero-padded decimal number (00 to 59).\n- `%p`: Locale\u2019s AM or PM.\n\nBy using this format string, your code should correctly parse the date strings, taking into account both zero-padded and non-zero-padded numbers in the date and time."
