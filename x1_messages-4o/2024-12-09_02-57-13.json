        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"TypeError: No loop matching the specified signature and casting was found for ufunc svd_n_s\", typically arises due to issues with the data types or the way the data is being handled in the numerical operations. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Data Types**: Ensure that all the columns in your dataset are of the correct numeric type, especially the ones you're using for analysis. You can use `dataset.dtypes` to inspect the data types of your columns. If there are any non-numeric types in `X` or `y`, you should convert them to numeric types using `pd.to_numeric()` or similar functions.\n\n2. **Update Libraries**: Ensure that your libraries are up to date. Sometimes, library updates fix underlying compatibility issues. You can update your libraries using pip:\n   ```\n   pip install --upgrade numpy pandas statsmodels sklearn\n   ```\n\n3. **Replace `Imputer` with `SimpleImputer`**: The `Imputer` class from `sklearn.preprocessing` has been deprecated. You should use `SimpleImputer` instead:\n   ```python\n   from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer\n   imputer = SimpleImputer(missing_values=np.nan, strategy='mean')\n   X[:,0:2] = imputer.fit_transform(X[:,0:2])\n   ```\n\n4. **Ensure Correct Use of `train_test_split`**: The module `train_test_split` has been moved to `sklearn.model_selection`. Make sure you're using the correct import:\n   ```python\n   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n   ```\n\n5. **Inspect `X` and `y`**: Before fitting your model with statsmodels, double-check the shapes and contents of `X_opt` and `y` to ensure there are no unexpected NaNs or infinite values. You can use:\n   ```python\n   print(np.isnan(X_opt).sum(), np.isnan(y).sum())\n   print(np.isinf(X_opt).sum(), np.isinf(y).sum())\n   ```\n\n6. **Check for Singular Matrix**: If your data matrix `X_opt` is singular (i.e., it has linearly dependent columns), it can cause problems with OLS fitting. Inspect your data for multicollinearity or redundancy.\n\nAfter making these adjustments, try running your script again. If you continue to encounter issues, consider examining the data for any other inconsistencies or potential problems, such as outliers or scaling issues."
