        "content": "The errors you're encountering are due to the fact that `'nan'` is being recognized as a string in your list, and these methods are typically used for handling `numpy.nan` or `float('nan')` values, which are of type `float`. To remove `'nan'` as a string, you can simply use a list comprehension to filter it out. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Method: Filtering 'nan' as a String\n\nIf `'nan'` is a string, you can remove it with a simple list comprehension:\n\n```python\ncountries = ['nan', 'USA', 'UK', 'France']\n\n# Filter out 'nan' which is a string\ncleanedList = [x for x in countries if x != 'nan']\n\nprint(cleanedList)\n```\n\n### If 'nan' is a float (e.g., numpy.nan)\n\nIf the `'nan'` values are actually `numpy.nan` or `float('nan')`, you should ensure you import the necessary modules and handle it as follows:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ncountries = [np.nan, 'USA', 'UK', 'France']\n\n# Remove np.nan using list comprehension\ncleanedList = [x for x in countries if not (isinstance(x, float) and np.isnan(x))]\n\nprint(cleanedList)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **String 'nan':** If `'nan'` is a string, you simply check for equality (`x != 'nan'`).\n- **Numpy or Float 'nan':** If `'nan'` is represented as `numpy.nan` or `float('nan')`, use `numpy.isnan()` to check for it, and filter it out using a list comprehension.\n\nChoose the method that corresponds to the data type of `'nan'` in your list."
