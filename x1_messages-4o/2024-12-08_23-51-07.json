        "content": "Certainly! Representing complex carbohydrates such as cellulose, glycogen, and oligosaccharides using Ruby involves creating data structures that can capture their molecular composition and relationships. Here's a concise overview:\n\n### Ruby Representation\n\n1. **Basic Structure:**\n   - Use classes to represent basic sugar units (monosaccharides) and their linkages.\n   - Define classes for complex carbohydrates like Cellulose, Glycogen, and Oligosaccharides.\n\n2. **Classes and Relationships:**\n   ```ruby\n   class Monosaccharide\n     attr_accessor :name, :formula\n\n     def initialize(name, formula)\n       @name = name\n       @formula = formula\n     end\n   end\n\n   class Polysaccharide\n     attr_accessor :units, :linkage_type\n\n     def initialize(units, linkage_type)\n       @units = units\n       @linkage_type = linkage_type\n     end\n\n     def add_unit(monosaccharide)\n       @units << monosaccharide\n     end\n   end\n\n   class Cellulose < Polysaccharide\n     def initialize\n       super([], '\u03b2-1,4-glycosidic')\n     end\n   end\n\n   class Glycogen < Polysaccharide\n     def initialize\n       super([], '\u03b1-1,4-glycosidic with \u03b1-1,6 branches')\n     end\n   end\n\n   class Oligosaccharide\n     attr_accessor :units\n\n     def initialize(units)\n       @units = units\n     end\n   end\n   ```\n\n3. **Creating Instances:**\n   - Create instances of `Monosaccharide` for glucose, etc.\n   - Add these to `Cellulose`, `Glycogen`, or `Oligosaccharide` objects to represent their structure.\n\n### Physiological Functions\n\n1. **Energy Storage:**\n   - **Glycogen**: Acts as a primary energy reserve in animals. It's stored in liver and muscle tissues, providing a quick-release glucose source during physical activity or fasting.\n\n2. **Structural Support:**\n   - **Cellulose**: Provides structural strength to plant cell walls. It's composed of \u03b2-1,4-linked glucose units, forming strong fibrils that resist hydrolysis.\n\n3. **Cell Signaling:**\n   - **Oligosaccharides**: Often attach to proteins and lipids on cell surfaces, playing key roles in cell recognition, signaling, and adhesion processes.\n\n4. **Immune Modulation:**\n   - Certain oligosaccharides can modulate immune responses by interacting with immune cells, influencing inflammation and pathogen recognition.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy using Ruby to structurally represent these carbohydrates, you can simulate and analyze their biological functions. This approach provides a programmable way to understand complex biochemical interactions and their implications on cellular processes and energy dynamics."
