Therefore, to process 2000 invoices, you would divide the total number of invoices by the number processed per hour:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2000 \\text{ invoices}}{100 \\text{ invoices/hour}} = 20 \\text{ hours}\n   \\]\n\nSo, it will take the software approximately 20 hours to complete the task. Since this is already a whole number, there's no need to round."
