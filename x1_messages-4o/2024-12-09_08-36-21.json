I have tried using `p_table.apply(pd.Series.round(2))` but I receive the following error message: \"unbound method round() must be called with Series instance as first argument (got int instance instead)\". I would like to know the correct way of achieving this."

        "content": "To round each number in a pandas DataFrame to two decimal places, you can use the `DataFrame.round()` method, which is specifically designed for this purpose. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\np_table = pd.DataFrame({\n    'A': [1.12345, 2.34567, 3.98765],\n    'B': [4.56789, 5.67891, 6.78912],\n    'C': [7.89123, 8.91234, 9.12345]\n})\n\n# Round each number in the DataFrame to two decimal places\nrounded_table = p_table.round(2)\n\nprint(rounded_table)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n      A     B     C\n0  1.12  4.57  7.89\n1  2.35  5.68  8.91\n2  3.99  6.79  9.12\n```\n\nThe `DataFrame.round()` method is straightforward and efficient for rounding numerical values in a DataFrame. Make sure that the columns you want to round contain numerical data types (e.g., int or float) for this method to work properly."
