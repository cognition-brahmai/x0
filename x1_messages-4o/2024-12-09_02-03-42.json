This is the setup in my models.py:\n\n```python\nclass Location(models.Model):\n    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n    my_location = models.CharField(max_length=120, choices=LOCATION_CHOICES)\n    update_date = models.DateField(auto_now=True, null=True)\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return self.my_location\n\n\nclass UserProfile(models.Model):\n\n    user = models.ForeignKey(User)\n    # The additional attributes we wish to include.\n    user_base = models.CharField(max_length=120, choices=LOCATION_CHOICES)\n    user_position = models.CharField(max_length=120)\n    user_phone = models.PositiveIntegerField()\n\n    def __unicode__(self):\n        return self.user.username\n```\n\nAnd this is my view in views.py:\n\n```python\ndef search_by_location(request):\n    if 'q' in request.GET and request.GET['q']:\n        q = request.GET['q']\n        locations = Location.objects.filter(my_location__icontains=q).order_by('-update_date')\n    else:\n        locations = Location.objects.order_by('-update_date')\ncontext = {'locations': locations}\nreturn render(request, 'index.html', context)\n```\n\nWhen I replace `my_location` with `user` in the filter query, I receive an error: \"Related Field got invalid lookup: icontains\". Could you provide advice on how to troubleshoot this or recommend any relevant documentation?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the `user` field in your `Location` model is a `ForeignKey`. When dealing with `ForeignKey` fields, you need to specify which field from the related model (in this case, the `User` model) you want to perform the lookup on. The `icontains` lookup can only be used on string fields, not on a `ForeignKey` directly.\n\nTo filter `Location` objects based on a field of the related `User` object, you should use the double underscore (`__`) syntax to specify the related field. For example, if you want to filter by the username of the `User`, you would do something like this:\n\n```python\ndef search_by_location(request):\n    if 'q' in request.GET and request.GET['q']:\n        q = request.GET['q']\n        locations = Location.objects.filter(user__username__icontains=q).order_by('-update_date')\n    else:\n        locations = Location.objects.order_by('-update_date')\n    context = {'locations': locations}\n    return render(request, 'index.html', context)\n```\n\nIn the above example, `user__username` is used to filter based on the `username` field of the related `User` model. You can replace `username` with any other field of the `User` model that you would like to filter by.\n\nAdditionally, ensure that your import statements are correctly set up in your `views.py`. You need to import the `Location` model, and if necessary, any other models or Django utilities you are using in your view. Also, make sure your indentation is correct in the view function, as it looks like the `return` statement is not properly indented in the code snippet you provided."
