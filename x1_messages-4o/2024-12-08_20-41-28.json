The string must have a length between 3 to 20 characters, cannot contain any repeating characters, and should have at least one vowel and one consonant. For example, if the given string is \"level\", what would be the output of the formula? Please provide the formula code."

        "content": "To determine if a string is a palindrome under the specified constraints, you can use a combination of checks to ensure the string satisfies all conditions and then verify if it's a palindrome. Here's a Python function that implements this logic:\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome_with_constraints(s):\n    # Check the length constraint\n    if len(s) < 3 or len(s) > 20:\n        return False\n\n    # Check for repeating characters\n    if len(set(s)) != len(s):\n        return False\n\n    # Check for at least one vowel and one consonant\n    vowels = set(\"aeiouAEIOU\")\n    has_vowel = any(char in vowels for char in s)\n    has_consonant = any(char not in vowels for char in s)\n\n    if not (has_vowel and has_consonant):\n        return False\n\n    # Check if the string is a palindrome\n    if s != s[::-1]:\n        return False\n\n    return True\n\n# Example usage\nstring = \"level\"\nresult = is_palindrome_with_constraints(string)\nprint(f\"The string '{string}' meets the constraints and is a palindrome: {result}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Length Check**: Ensures the string's length is between 3 and 20 characters.\n2. **Unique Characters Check**: Uses a set to ensure all characters in the string are unique.\n3. **Vowel and Consonant Check**: Confirms at least one vowel and one consonant are present.\n4. **Palindrome Check**: Compares the string to its reverse to check if it is a palindrome.\n\nFor the string \"level\", this function will return `False` because \"level\" contains repeating characters ('e' appears twice)."
