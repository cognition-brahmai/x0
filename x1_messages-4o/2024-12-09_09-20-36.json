Assuming you want to count all the books in the table, you can use the following SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS total_books FROM books;\n```\n\nThis query will return a single row with a column named `total_books`, which will contain the total count of all rows (books) in the `books` table."
