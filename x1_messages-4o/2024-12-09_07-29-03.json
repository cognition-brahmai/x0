        "content": "In Python, functions can be called using both positional arguments and keyword arguments. In the function definition `rectangleArea(width, height)`, `width` and `height` are indeed positional parameters when you call the function with just their values, like `rectangleArea(1, 2)`.\n\nHowever, Python also allows you to call functions using keyword arguments, which is why you can use the syntax `rectangleArea(width=1, height=2)`. When you use keyword arguments, you explicitly specify which parameter each value is assigned to, using the parameter name. This provides flexibility in the order of arguments and improves readability, as it makes it clear what each argument represents.\n\nThe ability to use keyword arguments does not change the fact that `width` and `height` are positional parameters in the function definition; it simply provides an alternative way to call the function. This feature is particularly useful in functions with many parameters, allowing you to skip some and specify only the ones you want to provide, or to clarify what each argument represents when calling the function."
