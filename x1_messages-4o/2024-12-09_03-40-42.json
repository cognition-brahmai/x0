        "content": "In Django, checking if a connection to a database is active isn't as straightforward as calling a method like `settings.DATABASES['default'].check_connection()`. However, you can achieve this by attempting to use the database connection and handling any exceptions that may arise. Here's a common way to check if the connection is active:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import connections\nfrom django.db.utils import OperationalError\n\ndef check_mysql_connection():\n    db_conn = connections['default']  # Use the alias for your database. 'default' is the default alias.\n    try:\n        # Attempt to execute a simple query\n        db_conn.cursor()\n        print(\"Database connection is active.\")\n        return True\n    except OperationalError:\n        print(\"Database connection is inactive.\")\n        return False\n\n# Call the function to check the connection\nis_connected = check_mysql_connection()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`connections['default']`**: This retrieves the connection object for the default database. You can replace `'default'` with any other alias if you have multiple databases set up.\n- **`db_conn.cursor()`**: This line attempts to get a cursor from the connection, which will trigger a connection to the database if it's not already connected.\n- **`OperationalError`**: This exception is caught if there's an issue with the database connection, such as the database server being unreachable.\n\nThis method provides a practical way to check the status of your database connection within a Django application."
