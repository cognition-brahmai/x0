I have an HTML tag `<img src=\"images/dynamic_chart.png\" />` linked up to a request handler that creates an in-memory image. The handler is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef chart(request):\n    img = Image.new(\"RGB\", (300,300), \"#FFFFFF\")\n    data = [(i,randint(100,200)) for i in range(0,300,10)]\n    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)\n    draw.polygon(data, fill=\"#000000\")\n    # now what?\n    return HttpResponse(output)\n```\n\nI am planning to modify the requests to AJAX and introduce a caching mechanism but I believe that would not influence this part of the solution."

        "content": "To serve a dynamically generated image in Django, you need to return the image as an `HttpResponse` with the appropriate content type. In your example, you're generating an image using PIL (Python Imaging Library). You'll need to save the image to an in-memory file object and then return it.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can modify your `chart` view to achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom django.http import HttpResponse\nfrom PIL import Image, ImageDraw\nfrom io import BytesIO\nfrom random import randint\n\ndef chart(request):\n    # Create a new image with RGB mode\n    img = Image.new(\"RGB\", (300, 300), \"#FFFFFF\")\n    \n    # Generate some random data for the chart\n    data = [(i, randint(100, 200)) for i in range(0, 300, 10)]\n    \n    # Draw on the image\n    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)\n    draw.polygon(data, fill=\"#000000\")\n    \n    # Save the image to a BytesIO object\n    output = BytesIO()\n    img.save(output, format='PNG')\n    output.seek(0)\n    \n    # Return the image as a response with the correct content type\n    return HttpResponse(output, content_type='image/png')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Image Creation**: You create an image using PIL and draw on it as needed.\n\n2. **BytesIO**: This is an in-memory stream for bytes. You use it to save the image data. This avoids the need to write the image to disk.\n\n3. **Image Save**: Save the image to the `BytesIO` object with `img.save(output, format='PNG')`. The `format='PNG'` specifies the image format.\n\n4. **Seek**: You call `output.seek(0)` to move the file pointer to the start of the file. This is necessary because saving the image moves the pointer to the end.\n\n5. **HttpResponse**: You return the image as an HTTP response with `content_type='image/png'`. This tells the browser that the response is an image.\n\nThis approach allows you to serve dynamically generated images directly via Django views, and it integrates smoothly with AJAX requests and caching mechanisms, which you can implement to optimize performance further."
