This seems to be the correct configuration, however, PyCharm is highlighting my valid code with \"unresolved reference\" errors, even for built-in Python functions. Why aren't these being detected, despite the fact that the code is able to run? Is there a way to get PyCharm to recognize these correctly? This problem appears not only with a remote interpreter, but also with local interpreters."

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing with PyCharm showing \"unresolved reference\" errors despite having a working configuration is a common one. Here are several steps you can take to resolve this problem:\n\n1. **Invalidate Caches and Restart**: Sometimes, PyCharm's cache can become corrupted or outdated, leading to incorrect error highlighting. You can fix this by going to `File` -> `Invalidate Caches / Restart...` -> `Invalidate and Restart`. This will clear the cache and restart PyCharm, which might resolve the issue.\n\n2. **Check the Project Interpreter**: Ensure that the correct interpreter is selected for your project. Go to `File` -> `Settings` (or `PyCharm` -> `Preferences` on macOS) -> `Project: <Your Project Name>` -> `Python Interpreter`. Make sure the interpreter listed is the one you intend to use, and that it is properly configured.\n\n3. **Update Interpreter Paths**: If you're using a virtual environment or a remote interpreter, make sure that the paths to your packages are correctly set. Sometimes, PyCharm might not automatically detect all the paths. You can manually add them under the interpreter settings.\n\n4. **Install and Update Packages**: Ensure that all necessary packages are installed in your interpreter environment. Missing packages can lead to unresolved references. You can do this via the PyCharm interface or by using a terminal to install packages using pip.\n\n5. **Sync with Virtual Environment**: If you're using a virtual environment, make sure it is activated and synced with PyCharm. Sometimes, PyCharm might not automatically recognize the virtual environment if it was created outside of the IDE.\n\n6. **Check for PyCharm Updates**: Ensure that you are using the latest version of PyCharm. Updates often fix bugs and improve compatibility with various Python versions and configurations.\n\n7. **Rebuild the Project**: Sometimes, simply rebuilding the project can help PyCharm recognize the code properly. You can do this by going to `Build` -> `Rebuild Project`.\n\n8. **Check for Excluded Directories**: Ensure that the directories containing your code are not marked as excluded. You can check this by right-clicking on the directory in the Project pane, and ensuring that it is not marked as \"Excluded\".\n\n9. **Check for Missing SDK**: Sometimes, PyCharm might not recognize the SDK or interpreter paths correctly. Ensure that the SDK is configured correctly in the project settings.\n\n10. **Revalidate Source Roots**: Make sure that the source roots are correctly set in your project. Right-click on your source directory in the Project pane and select `Mark Directory as` -> `Sources Root`.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, it could be a more specific problem related to your project's configuration or a bug in PyCharm. In such cases, consider reaching out to JetBrains support for further assistance."
