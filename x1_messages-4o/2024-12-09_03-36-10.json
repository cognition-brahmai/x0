        "content": "The difference between `django.utils.timezone.now()` and `datetime.datetime.now()` primarily lies in their handling of time zones.\n\n1. **`datetime.datetime.now()`**: \n   - This function is part of the standard Python library and returns the current local date and time. \n   - It does not include timezone information unless explicitly specified.\n   - This means that if your server is set to a different timezone than your application's users, it might not reflect the correct time for your users.\n\n2. **`django.utils.timezone.now()`**: \n   - This function is provided by Django and returns the current date and time with timezone awareness.\n   - It respects the `USE_TZ` setting in your Django project settings. If `USE_TZ` is set to `True`, `timezone.now()` will return an aware `datetime` object in UTC, which is the recommended setting for Django projects.\n   - This approach is generally more robust for web applications, especially when dealing with users across different time zones.\n\n### Which to Use?\n\n- **When to use `timezone.now()`**:\n  - If your Django project's `USE_TZ` setting is `True` (which is recommended), it's best to use `timezone.now()` to ensure that your datetime objects are timezone-aware.\n  - This is particularly important for web applications that serve users in multiple time zones, as it helps keep datetime data consistent across different parts of your application.\n\n- **When to use `datetime.datetime.now()`**:\n  - You might use this if your project is set to not use time zones (`USE_TZ` is `False`), and you are certain the server's timezone setting aligns with your application's needs.\n  - However, this is less recommended in a globalized context where time zone awareness is important.\n\n### General Rule of Thumb:\n- For Django applications, especially those with `USE_TZ` set to `True`, prefer using `django.utils.timezone.now()`. This ensures that your datetime objects are timezone-aware and consistent with Django's handling of time zones.\n- Use `datetime.datetime.now()` only when you need a naive datetime object and are sure about the implications of doing so in terms of time zone handling.\n\nIn the context of your `INSERT` example:\n```python\nProduct.objects.create(title='Soap', date_added=timezone.now())\n```\nThis would be the more appropriate choice if `USE_TZ` is `True` in your Django settings."
