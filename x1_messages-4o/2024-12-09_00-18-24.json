        "content": "I am trying to make a scatter plot using matplotlib in Python. However, whenever I use any kind of marker, the default plotting behavior of matplotlib ends up cutting off the left half of the marker on the left side of the plot, and the right side of the marker on the right side of the plot. What I want is to automatically add some extra space to the left and right side of the plot without adding extra tick labels. This is to ensure that my markers aren't cut off and there aren't any x-tick labels that don't correspond to any points. Here is the code I've used:\n\n```python\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nxx = np.arange(10)\nyy = np.random.random(10)\nplt.plot(xx, yy, 'o')\n```\n\nThis code results in a graph where the markers at x = 0 and x = 4.5 are cut off. How can I have the full circles at these points without adding more tick labels and keeping the code as short and automatic as possible?"

        "content": "To ensure that the markers in your scatter plot are not cut off on the edges while keeping the code concise, you can adjust the x-axis limits to add some padding. This can be achieved using the `set_xlim()` function from `matplotlib`. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Generate data\nxx = np.arange(10)\nyy = np.random.random(10)\n\n# Plot the data\nplt.plot(xx, yy, 'o')\n\n# Adjust x-axis limits with some padding\nplt.xlim(xx[0] - 0.5, xx[-1] + 0.5)\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this code, `plt.xlim(xx[0] - 0.5, xx[-1] + 0.5)` adds a padding of 0.5 to both the left and right sides of the plot, ensuring that the markers at the edges are fully visible without adding extra tick labels. You can adjust the padding value (0.5 in this case) as needed based on the size of your markers."
