Each webpage class has methods to automate the functionality on that page. There are methods to click the link between pages, which returns the class of the linked page. However, import statements are scattered all over the place and not at the top of the file as conventionally done. When I try placing import statements at the top of the file, I get import errors due to circular dependencies. How can I resolve this?"

        "content": "Circular dependencies can be a common issue in complex codebases, especially when multiple modules or classes depend on each other. In Python, there are several strategies you can employ to resolve circular dependencies in a Pythonic way:\n\n1. **Refactor to Reduce Dependencies:**\n   - **Identify common functionality:** Extract common behaviors or shared data into a separate module or class. This can help reduce dependencies between classes.\n   - **Use Interfaces or Abstract Base Classes:** Define interfaces or abstract base classes if certain methods are common across different classes. This promotes loose coupling and can help break circular dependencies.\n\n2. **Lazy Imports:**\n   - Use local imports inside functions or methods instead of at the top of the file. This way, the import is executed only when the function is called, avoiding circular dependencies on module loading.\n   ```python\n   class PageA:\n       def click_link_to_page_b(self):\n           from page_b import PageB\n           return PageB()\n   ```\n\n3. **Module Level Imports:**\n   - If possible, redesign the modules so that the dependencies are one-directional. Sometimes, rethinking the module structure can help minimize or eliminate circular dependencies.\n\n4. **Use Dependency Injection:**\n   - Pass instances of classes as parameters to methods instead of importing them. This can help reduce the need for direct imports and decouple the code.\n\n5. **Conditional Imports:**\n   - Conditionally import modules or use try-except blocks for imports that may lead to circular dependencies. However, this should be a last resort as it can make the code harder to follow.\n\n6. **Reorganize the Codebase:**\n   - Consider reorganizing the code structure to better reflect dependencies. Sometimes, breaking large modules into smaller, more focused ones can help.\n\n7. **Check for Redundant Dependencies:**\n   - Review the imports and remove any that are unnecessary or redundant. This can sometimes resolve circular dependencies by simplifying the dependency graph.\n\nBy applying these strategies, you should be able to manage circular dependencies more effectively, making your codebase cleaner and more maintainable."
