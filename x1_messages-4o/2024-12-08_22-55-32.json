If the dividend is not a multiple of the divisor, return a message that indicates the remainder. Can you provide an example of using this function to calculate the result of 35 divided by 4?\nHere's a rough implementation of the function, try to complete it:\ndef trickyDivide(dividend: Int, divisor: Int): Any = {\n  if (divisor == 0) {\n    \"Cannot divide by zero\"\n  } else {\n    if (dividend % divisor == 0) {\n      // handle the case when dividend is a multiple of divisor\n      ___________\n    } else {\n      // handle the case when dividend is not a multiple of divisor\n      ___________\n    }\n  }\n}\nAnd here's how you can use it to calculate the result of 35 divided by 4:\nval result = trickyDivide(35, 4)\nprintln(result)\nThis should output a message that indicates the remainder. If you try to divide by zero by calling trickyDivide(35, 0), it will return the message \"Cannot divide by zero\"."

        "content": "Certainly! We can complete your `trickyDivide` function so that it handles cases where the divisor is zero and checks if the dividend is a multiple of the divisor. If not, it should return a message indicating the remainder. Here's the completed implementation:\n\n```scala\ndef trickyDivide(dividend: Int, divisor: Int): Any = {\n  if (divisor == 0) {\n    \"Cannot divide by zero\"\n  } else {\n    if (dividend % divisor == 0) {\n      dividend / divisor\n    } else {\n      val quotient = dividend / divisor\n      val remainder = dividend % divisor\n      s\"The dividend is not a multiple of the divisor. Quotient: $quotient, Remainder: $remainder\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nval result = trickyDivide(35, 4)\nprintln(result)\n```\n\nWhen you run the above code with `trickyDivide(35, 4)`, it will output:\n\n```\nThe dividend is not a multiple of the divisor. Quotient: 8, Remainder: 3\n```\n\nAnd if you try to divide by zero with `trickyDivide(35, 0)`, it will return:\n\n```\nCannot divide by zero\n```\n\nThis function checks for division by zero and calculates the quotient and remainder when the dividend is not a multiple of the divisor."
