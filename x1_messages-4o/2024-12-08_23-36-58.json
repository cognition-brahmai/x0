        "content": "A decision tree is a graphical representation used for decision-making that models decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility. It is a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a test or decision on an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of that test, and each leaf node represents a class label or decision outcome.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of its components:\n\n1. **Root Node**: The top node of the tree, which represents the entire dataset and is the starting point for making decisions.\n\n2. **Decision Nodes**: Internal nodes that split based on the value of a particular attribute. Each node represents a decision point that leads to different branches based on the outcome.\n\n3. **Branches**: These are the lines connecting nodes and represent the decision rules applied to the attributes.\n\n4. **Leaf Nodes (Terminal Nodes)**: Nodes at the end of the tree that represent the final decision or classification.\n\nDecision trees are commonly used in machine learning for classification and regression tasks. They have the advantage of being easy to understand and interpret, as they closely mirror human decision-making processes. Key algorithms for constructing decision trees include ID3, C4.5, CART, and others. However, they can be prone to overfitting, especially with complex trees, and are sensitive to noisy data."
