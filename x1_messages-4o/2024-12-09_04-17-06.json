        "content": "To run a simple Python script on Heroku every 10 minutes using the Heroku Scheduler, you'll need to follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Your Python Script\nEnsure your Python script is ready and stored in your project repository. Let's say your script is named `my_script.py`.\n\n### Step 2: Create a `Procfile`\nThe `Procfile` is used to declare the application's process types and entry points. If you don't have a `Procfile` in your project already, create one at the root of your project directory. Since you're using Heroku Scheduler, you don't need to run your script as a web process, but you should define a worker process in the `Procfile` like so:\n\n```\nworker: python my_script.py\n```\n\n### Step 3: Deploy Your App to Heroku\nEnsure your app is pushed to Heroku. You can do this by committing your changes and pushing to Heroku's Git remote:\n\n```bash\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Add script and Procfile\"\ngit push heroku main\n```\n\n### Step 4: Add Heroku Scheduler\n1. Go to your Heroku dashboard.\n2. Select your application.\n3. Navigate to the \"Resources\" tab.\n4. In the \"Add-ons\" section, search for \"Heroku Scheduler\" and add it to your app.\n\n### Step 5: Schedule Your Task\n1. Once added, click on \"Heroku Scheduler\" to configure it.\n2. Click \"Add Job\".\n3. In the \"Run Command\" input box, enter the command to run your script. This should be the same command you put in your `Procfile` for the worker, which is:\n   ```\n   python my_script.py\n   ```\n4. Set the frequency to \"Every 10 minutes\" from the dropdown menu.\n5. Click \"Save Job\".\n\n### Additional Notes\n- Ensure that your script does not have any blocking operations or long-running tasks that could prevent it from completing within 10 minutes, as it will be triggered again.\n- Make sure you have all necessary dependencies listed in your `requirements.txt` file, and they are installed when deploying to Heroku.\n- If you need to handle environment variables, you can set them in the Heroku dashboard under the \"Settings\" tab of your application.\n\nBy following these steps, your Python script should run every 10 minutes on Heroku using the scheduler."
