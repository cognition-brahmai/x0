I have an array A as follows:\n\n```python\nA = array([[0, 1, 2], [0, 2, 0]])\n```\n\nI want to add rows from another array X to A if the first element of each row in X is less than 3. In Python lists, I would simply do:\n\n```python\nfor i in X:\n    if i[0] < 3:\n        A.append(i)\n```\n\nBut numpy arrays do not seem to have an 'append' method like Python lists. Is there a numpythonic way to achieve this?"

        "content": "Certainly! In NumPy, you can achieve this by using boolean indexing and `np.vstack` for stacking arrays. Here's how you can do it:\n\nFirst, let's assume you have your arrays `A` and `X`:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nA = np.array([[0, 1, 2], [0, 2, 0]])\nX = np.array([[1, 4, 5], [3, 6, 7], [2, 8, 9]])\n```\n\nYou want to add rows from `X` to `A` where the first element of each row in `X` is less than 3. You can achieve this using boolean indexing to filter the rows in `X`, and then use `np.vstack` to stack them vertically with `A`:\n\n```python\n# Filter the rows in X where the first element is less than 3\nrows_to_add = X[X[:, 0] < 3]\n\n# Stack the filtered rows vertically to A\nA = np.vstack((A, rows_to_add))\n\nprint(A)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's happening:\n\n1. `X[:, 0] < 3` creates a boolean array where each element is `True` if the first element of the corresponding row in `X` is less than 3.\n2. `X[X[:, 0] < 3]` uses this boolean array to filter rows in `X`.\n3. `np.vstack((A, rows_to_add))` stacks the filtered rows from `X` onto `A`.\n\nAfter executing the above code, `A` will be:\n\n```\narray([[0, 1, 2],\n       [0, 2, 0],\n       [1, 4, 5],\n       [2, 8, 9]])\n```\n\nThis is the NumPy way of appending rows based on a condition."
