For example, in the dataset [10, 14, 25, 467, 12], '467' is clearly an anomaly and I want to flag such instances. I'm looking for a simple, robust anomaly detection technique, possibly using standard deviation. The values are all positive and non-zero and I expect them to form a normal distribution. I've tried the three-sigma and IQR outlier test, but they either flag values which are not extreme enough or point out instances which better align with my intuition of the domain. What anomaly detection technique would you recommend for such a one-dimensional data scenario?"

        "content": "For detecting extreme outliers in a one-dimensional dataset, especially when the dataset is expected to follow a normal distribution, you can consider a few approaches beyond the standard three-sigma and IQR methods. Here are some recommendations that you might find useful:\n\n1. **Modified Z-Score Method**: Unlike the traditional Z-score, the modified Z-score uses the median and median absolute deviation (MAD), which makes it more robust to outliers. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Modified Z-Score} = 0.6745 \\times \\frac{(X_i - \\text{Median})}{\\text{MAD}}\n   \\]\n   A common threshold for identifying outliers is a modified Z-score greater than 3.5.\n\n2. **Tukey's Fences**: While similar to the IQR method, Tukey's fences extend the IQR to better capture extreme outliers. Define:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Lower Fence} = Q1 - k \\times IQR\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Upper Fence} = Q3 + k \\times IQR\n   \\]\n   Typically, \\( k = 1.5 \\) for mild outliers and \\( k = 3 \\) for extreme outliers. You can adjust \\( k \\) based on your domain knowledge.\n\n3. **Boxplot Method**: Visualize your data with a boxplot to identify outliers. This provides a quick visual check and often aligns well with intuition.\n\n4. **Percentile Method**: Define a percentile range (e.g., 1st and 99th percentile) and flag any data points outside this range as outliers. This method is simple and often effective, particularly if you have domain knowledge to guide the percentile cutoffs.\n\n5. **Robust Statistical Techniques**: Consider using robust statistics such as the Hampel identifier, which uses median and MAD but adjusts the thresholds based on the data's robustness.\n\n6. **Machine Learning Approaches**: If you're open to more complex methods, consider using machine learning models like Isolation Forests or One-Class SVMs. These methods can capture non-linear relationships and detect anomalies more effectively.\n\nGiven your requirement for simplicity and robustness, starting with the Modified Z-Score Method or Tukey's Fences might be a good approach. Adjust the thresholds based on your domain knowledge and the specific characteristics of your dataset."
