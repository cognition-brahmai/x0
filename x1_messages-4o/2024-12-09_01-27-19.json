This is because `None` is not considered comparable to other data types using these operators. \n\nIn Python 2, it was possible to compare `None` with other values without raising an error, as `None` was considered less than any number or string. However, this behavior was removed in Python 3 to avoid ambiguities and inconsistent comparisons.\n\nTherefore, in Python 3, there is no built-in datatype other than `None` itself that would satisfy the condition `not foo > None` without raising an error. Any attempt to compare `foo` with `None` using `>` will result in a `TypeError`, regardless of the type of `foo`."
