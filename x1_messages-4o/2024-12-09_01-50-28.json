        "content": "How can I pass a Queue reference to a function managed by pool.map_async()? I want a long-running process to return its progress over a Queue which I will feed to a progress bar dialog. I also need the result when the process is completed. However, when I try to pass a Queue reference to pool.map_async(), I get a RuntimeError: Queue objects should only be shared between processes through inheritance. Here is the code I am working with:\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing, time\n\ndef task(args):\n    count = args[0]\n    queue = args[1]\n    for i in xrange(count):\n        queue.put(\"%d mississippi\" % i)\n    return \"Done\"\n\ndef main():\n    q = multiprocessing.Queue()\n    pool = multiprocessing.Pool()\n    result = pool.map_async(task, [(x, q) for x in range(10)])\n    time.sleep(1)\n    while not q.empty():\n        print q.get()\n    print result.get()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nI managed to get it working using individual Process objects where I can pass a Queue reference, but then I don't have a pool to manage the many processes I want to launch. Can anyone suggest a better pattern for this?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering arises because `multiprocessing.Queue` objects are not directly pickleable, which is necessary for them to be passed as arguments to functions executed in a process pool. Instead, you can use a `multiprocessing.Manager` to create a `Queue` that can be shared between processes. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport multiprocessing\nimport time\n\ndef task(count, queue):\n    for i in range(count):\n        # Simulating some work with a delay\n        time.sleep(0.1)\n        message = f\"{i} mississippi\"\n        queue.put(message)\n    return \"Done\"\n\ndef main():\n    # Create a multiprocessing.Manager and use it to create a Queue\n    manager = multiprocessing.Manager()\n    q = manager.Queue()\n\n    # Initialize a pool with a specific number of processes\n    pool = multiprocessing.Pool()\n\n    # Use partial to pass constant arguments to the pool's worker function\n    args = [(x, q) for x in range(10)]\n    result = pool.starmap_async(task, args)\n\n    # Monitor the progress by reading from the queue\n    while True:\n        if not q.empty():\n            message = q.get()\n            print(message)\n        # Break when all processes are done and the queue is empty\n        if result.ready() and q.empty():\n            break\n        time.sleep(0.1)\n\n    # Get the result from the pool\n    print(result.get())\n\n    # Clean up the pool\n    pool.close()\n    pool.join()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Key Changes and Explanation:\n\n1. **Use of `multiprocessing.Manager`**: We use a `multiprocessing.Manager` to create a `Queue` that can be shared among processes.\n\n2. **`starmap_async` instead of `map_async`**: `starmap_async` is used to unpack arguments from a list of tuples, allowing you to pass multiple arguments to the worker function. This replaces the need to pass a single tuple argument like in your original `map_async` usage.\n\n3. **Progress Monitoring Loop**: The loop continuously checks for progress messages from the queue and prints them until all processes are complete and the queue is empty.\n\n4. **Gracefully Close the Pool**: After retrieving results, close the pool and join to ensure all processes are cleaned up properly.\n\nThis pattern should effectively manage the processes while allowing you to receive progress updates via the queue."
