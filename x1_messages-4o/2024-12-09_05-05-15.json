My current approach is to create routes for them like this:\n\n```python\n@app.route('/sitemap.xml', methods=['GET'])\ndef sitemap():\n  response = make_response(open('sitemap.xml').read())\n  return response\n```\n\nHowever, I'm wondering if there's a more convenient way to handle this situation."

        "content": "Yes, there is a more convenient way to serve static files like `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` from the root directory in a Flask application. Flask provides a built-in way to serve static files using the `send_from_directory` function. You can use this function to serve these files without having to manually read and return their contents.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Place your `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` files in a directory named `static` at the root level of your Flask application. Flask automatically serves files from the `static` directory.\n\n2. Use the `send_from_directory` function to serve these files:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, send_from_directory\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/robots.txt', methods=['GET'])\ndef robots_txt():\n    return send_from_directory(app.static_folder, 'robots.txt')\n\n@app.route('/sitemap.xml', methods=['GET'])\ndef sitemap_xml():\n    return send_from_directory(app.static_folder, 'sitemap.xml')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run()\n```\n\nIn this setup, the `send_from_directory` function will search for the file in the `static` directory and serve it. This approach is typically more efficient and simplifies the handling of static files in Flask applications.\n\nMake sure your `static` directory is correctly structured and contains the `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` files. This method follows Flask's conventions for serving static files, making it a clean and efficient solution."
