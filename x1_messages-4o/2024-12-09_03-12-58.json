I've been able to successfully run a sample Django application, but I'm unsure about which Python version Django is using. How can I check which version of Python is being used by Django and also determine what version of Django and its modules are being used?"

If you are managing multiple Python environments or using a virtual environment, make sure to activate the correct environment before running these commands."
