The absence of a 'do while' loop in Python is primarily based on the idea that the same functionality can be achieved using existing control structures, specifically by using a `while` loop with a slightly different pattern.\n\nHere's how you can mimic a 'do while' loop in Python:\n\n```python\nwhile True:\n    # statement(s)\n    \n    if not condition:\n        break\n```\n\nIn this pattern, the `while True` loop ensures that the body of the loop is executed at least once, and the `break` statement is used to exit the loop when the condition is no longer met. This provides the same effect as a 'do while' loop, where the loop's body is executed first, and the condition is checked afterward.\n\nPython's creators chose not to include a 'do while' loop because they believed that adding another loop structure would increase the language's complexity without providing significant additional functionality. By using the existing `while` and `break` statements, Python maintains its simplicity and readability while still allowing developers to implement the logic needed for such loops."
