How can I properly separate these **kwargs? My goal is to plot a set of points and an interpolated smooth curve. Here is my simple code:\n\n```python\ndef smoothy(x,y, kind='cubic', order = 3, **kwargs_for_scatter, **kwargs_for_plot):\n    yn_cor = interp1d(x, y, kind=kind, assume_sorted = False)\n    xn = np.linspace(np.min(x), np.max(x), len(x) * order)\n    plt.scatter(x,y, **kwargs_for_scatter)\n    plt.plot(xn, yn_cor(xn), **kwargs_for_plot);\n    return\n```\n\nI would appreciate any help on this."

        "content": "In Python, you cannot have two sets of `**kwargs` directly in a function definition because `**kwargs` is designed to capture all additional keyword arguments into a single dictionary. However, you can achieve your goal by using a single `**kwargs` and then separating them within the function based on some naming convention or predefined keys. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.interpolate import interp1d\n\ndef smoothy(x, y, kind='cubic', order=3, **kwargs):\n    # Separate kwargs based on a naming convention or specific keys\n    kwargs_for_scatter = {key[9:]: value for key, value in kwargs.items() if key.startswith('scatter_')}\n    kwargs_for_plot = {key[5:]: value for key, value in kwargs.items() if key.startswith('plot_')}\n\n    # Interpolation\n    yn_cor = interp1d(x, y, kind=kind, assume_sorted=False)\n    xn = np.linspace(np.min(x), np.max(x), len(x) * order)\n    \n    # Plotting\n    plt.scatter(x, y, **kwargs_for_scatter)\n    plt.plot(xn, yn_cor(xn), **kwargs_for_plot)\n    plt.show()\n\n# Example usage\nx = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\ny = np.array([1, 4, 9, 16, 25])\n\nsmoothy(\n    x, y,\n    scatter_color='red', scatter_marker='o',\n    plot_color='blue', plot_linestyle='--'\n)\n```\n\nIn this solution, the function `smoothy` uses a single `**kwargs` parameter to capture all additional keyword arguments. Inside the function, it separates these arguments into two dictionaries: `kwargs_for_scatter` and `kwargs_for_plot`. It does this by checking the prefix of each key. For example, keys starting with `scatter_` are assumed to be for the `plt.scatter` function, and keys starting with `plot_` are assumed to be for the `plt.plot` function. The prefix is stripped before passing the arguments to their respective functions.\n\nYou can then call the function with keyword arguments prefixed accordingly, as shown in the example usage.\n\nThis way, you can effectively manage two sets of keyword arguments for different sub-functions within a single function."
