Sometimes it works as expected, but other times it throws a `TypeError: super(type, obj): obj must be an instance or subtype of type`. I understand the meaning of the error but not why it is being raised. All the objects in my system are new style objects. The `super()` method in my `Retrieval` class seems to be invoked correctly but still causes errors. Here is the code from `DBConnection.py`:\n\n```python\nclass DBAdminConnection(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.user = DBUserConnection().user \n        self.submissions = DBSubmissionConnection()\n```\n\nAnd here is the `Retrieval` class from `Retrieval.py`:\n\n```python\nclass Retrieval(DBConnection.DBAdminConnection): \n    def __init__(self, username=None, password=None, unique_key=None):\n        super(Retrieval,self).__init__()\n        if username and password:\n            self.username = username\n            self.user.login(username,password, config.DATABASE)\n            if self.user.error:\n                raise UserLoginError(username)\n        self.unique_key = unique_key\n```\n\nWhy am I getting the TypeError and how can I fix it?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The `TypeError` you're encountering with the `super()` function is likely due to the way `super()` is being used in your `Retrieval` class. The error message `super(type, obj): obj must be an instance or subtype of type` suggests that there is a mismatch between the first and second arguments provided to `super()`.\n\nIn Python 2, `super()` is used as `super(ClassName, self)`, whereas in Python 3, it can be used without arguments inside a method, like `super()`. Since your code includes the `super(Retrieval, self).__init__()` syntax, it seems like it is intended for Python 2.\n\nHere's what could be causing the issue and how to fix it:\n\n1. **Ensure Correct Class Inheritance**: Verify that `Retrieval` is correctly inheriting from `DBAdminConnection` and that `DBAdminConnection` is a new-style class (which should be the case since it inherits from `object`).\n\n2. **Check for Multiple Inheritance**: If `DBAdminConnection` has multiple base classes, ensure that all classes in the hierarchy are new-style classes and correctly initialized.\n\n3. **Use Python 3 Syntax (if applicable)**: If you are using Python 3, you can simplify the call to `super()` by just using `super().__init__()`, which automatically refers to the current class and instance.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nclass Retrieval(DBConnection.DBAdminConnection): \n    def __init__(self, username=None, password=None, unique_key=None):\n        super().__init__()  # Simplified for Python 3\n        if username and password:\n            self.username = username\n            self.user.login(username, password, config.DATABASE)\n            if self.user.error:\n                raise UserLoginError(username)\n        self.unique_key = unique_key\n```\n\n4. **Check for Errors in `DBAdminConnection`**: Make sure there are no issues in the `DBAdminConnection` initializer or in any of its dependencies like `DBUserConnection` and `DBSubmissionConnection`.\n\nBy checking these areas and ensuring consistent usage of `super()`, you should be able to resolve the `TypeError`. If your environment is Python 3, simplifying `super()` calls can help avoid these errors. If you are using Python 2, ensure all classes are new-style and `super()` is called correctly."
