However, I'm unable to understand why they are indexed in this way. Furthermore, how do I determine each axis' index when dealing with multidimensional arrays?"

        "content": "In NumPy, the concept of axes is crucial for understanding how operations are applied to arrays. The axes in a NumPy array are indexed using integers, starting from 0. The way these axes are indexed depends on the dimensionality of the array:\n\n1. **1D Array**: A single-dimensional array has only one axis. For example, given an array `a = np.array([1, 2, 3])`, the only axis is axis 0.\n\n2. **2D Array**: A two-dimensional array, like a matrix, has two axes. For an array `b = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])`, axis 0 corresponds to the rows, and axis 1 corresponds to the columns. This means operations along axis 0 operate across rows, while those along axis 1 operate across columns.\n\n3. **3D Array**: A three-dimensional array, like a stack of matrices, has three axes. For example, in an array `c = np.array([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])`, axis 0 refers to the depth or the \"stack\" index, axis 1 to the rows, and axis 2 to the columns.\n\nTo determine the index of each axis in a multidimensional array, consider the following:\n\n- Axis 0 is always the first dimension, which typically represents the \"outermost\" part of the array.\n- Axis 1 is the next dimension, representing the next level of detail.\n- This pattern continues with increasing dimensions.\n\nThe reason for this indexing scheme is that it aligns with the memory layout of arrays in many programming languages, where the first index changes the slowest and the last index changes the fastest. This is sometimes referred to as \"row-major order.\"\n\nWhen dealing with operations like summing across axes, transposing, or reshaping, it's crucial to understand which axis corresponds to which part of the array. The shape of the array, accessible via `array.shape`, provides a tuple where each element corresponds to the size of the array along each axis, indexed from 0 upwards."
