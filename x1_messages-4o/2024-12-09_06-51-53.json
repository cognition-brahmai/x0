        "content": "The error message you're seeing typically occurs when there's a name collision between a Python file you've created and a standard library module. In this case, it seems you have a file named `csv.py` in your working directory or in your Python path, which is conflicting with Python's standard `csv` module.\n\nHere's how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Rename Your File:**\n   - Rename your file `csv.py` to something else, like `data_processing.py` to avoid name conflicts with the standard `csv` module.\n\n2. **Remove Compiled Files:**\n   - After renaming the file, make sure to remove any `.pyc` files that were generated. You might find these in the `__pycache__` directory inside the same folder. These are compiled Python files and can still cause conflicts.\n\n3. **Check Import Statements:**\n   - Ensure that there are no accidental imports from your own `csv.py` file in the code. Double-check all import statements to make sure they are importing from the correct modules.\n\n4. **Clear Python Cache:**\n   - You might also want to clear any cached bytecode by deleting the `__pycache__` folder within your project directory.\n\n5. **Verify Pandas Installation:**\n   - Ensure that the `pandas` library is correctly installed in your environment. You can verify this by running `pip show pandas` in your command prompt or terminal. If it's not installed, you can install it using `pip install pandas`.\n\nAfter you have taken these steps, try running your script again. This should resolve the `AttributeError` you were encountering."
