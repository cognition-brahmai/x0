Assuming you have the text you want to reverse and add to \"myDocument\", here's a simple code snippet to achieve that:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\n// Function to reverse a given string\nfunc reverseString(_ text: String) -> String {\n    return String(text.reversed())\n}\n\n// Function to write reversed text to a document\nfunc writeReversedTextToFile(text: String, fileName: String) {\n    let reversedText = reverseString(text)\n    \n    // Specify the file path\n    let fileURL = FileManager.default.homeDirectoryForCurrentUser.appendingPathComponent(fileName)\n    \n    do {\n        // Write the reversed text to the file\n        try reversedText.write(to: fileURL, atomically: true, encoding: .utf8)\n        print(\"Reversed text added to \\(fileName) successfully.\")\n    } catch {\n        print(\"Failed to write to file: \\(error)\")\n    }\n}\n\n// Example text to reverse\nlet textToReverse = \"Hello, Swift World!\"\n\n// Call the function with your text and document name\nwriteReversedTextToFile(text: textToReverse, fileName: \"myDocument.txt\")\n```\n\nReplace \"Hello, Swift World!\" with the text you want to reverse, and ensure that \"myDocument.txt\" is the name of the file you want to add the reversed text to. This script will write the reversed text to a file located in the user's home directory. Adjust the file path as necessary for your specific requirements."
