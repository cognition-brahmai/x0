I have a regular expression which works well with standard characters but fails when I try to use Norwegian characters. The code I'm using is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport re\nm = re.match(r'^/by_tag/(?P<tag>\\w+)/(?P<filename>(\\w|[.,!#%{}()@])+)$', '/by_tag/xmas/xmas1.jpg')\nprint(m.groupdict())\n```\n\nThis gives me the output: `{'tag': 'xmas', 'filename': 'xmas1.jpg'}`\n\nBut when I try to use Norwegian characters like this:\n\n```python\nm = re.match(r'^/by_tag/(?P<tag>\\w+)/(?P<filename>(\\w|[.,!#%{}()@])+)$', '/by_tag/p\u00e5ske/\u00f8yfjell.jpg')\nprint(m.groupdict())\n```\n\nI get an error:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"<interactive input>\", line 1, in <module>\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'groupdict'\n```\n\nI want to be able to match these unicode characters in both the tag and the filename groups in the regular expression."

        "content": "To match Unicode characters like `\u00f8`, `\u00e6`, and `\u00e5` in Python regular expressions, you need to use the `re.UNICODE` flag (or `re.U` for short). This flag allows the regular expression to match Unicode word characters, including those in the Norwegian alphabet, when using `\\w`.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to handle Unicode characters:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\npattern = r'^/by_tag/(?P<tag>\\w+)/(?P<filename>(\\w|[.,!#%{}()@])+)$'\n\n# Ensure the re.UNICODE flag is used\nm = re.match(pattern, '/by_tag/p\u00e5ske/\u00f8yfjell.jpg', re.UNICODE)\n\nif m:\n    print(m.groupdict())\nelse:\n    print(\"No match found\")\n```\n\nThis will correctly match the Norwegian characters in both the `tag` and `filename` groups, and you should get the expected output:\n\n```\n{'tag': 'p\u00e5ske', 'filename': '\u00f8yfjell.jpg'}\n```\n\nIn Python 3, the `re.UNICODE` flag is the default behavior, but it's still a good practice to include it explicitly when working with Unicode to ensure clarity and compatibility. If you encounter any additional issues, make sure your Python environment supports Unicode properly and that your source file is saved with an appropriate encoding, such as UTF-8."
