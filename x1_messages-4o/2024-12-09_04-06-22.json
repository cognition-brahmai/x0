I am currently using a method where I map a list to a string using the following code:\n```python\nfoostring = \",\".join( map(str, list_of_ids) )\n```\nThen I use this string in an 'IN' clause like so:\n```python\ncursor.execute(\"DELETE FROM foo.bar WHERE baz IN ('%s')\" % (foostring))\n```\nHowever, I believe this method is not safe and could be vulnerable to SQL injection because foostring is not passed as an argument to execute. Also, I have to quote and escape outside of the MySQL library. How can I accomplish this task safely, avoiding SQL injection, specifically using MySQLDB?"

        "content": "You're correct that directly injecting a string into SQL queries can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. To safely use a list of IDs in an `IN` clause, you should use parameterized queries, which allow the database driver to handle the quoting and escaping for you.\n\nHere's how you can accomplish this safely with MySQLDB:\n\n1. Use placeholders for each element in the list.\n2. Pass the list elements as parameters to the `execute` method.\n\nHere's a safe way to construct your query:\n\n```python\n# Assume list_of_ids is a list of integers or strings\nlist_of_ids = [1, 2, 3]  # Example list\n\n# Create a string of placeholders, one for each item in list_of_ids\nplaceholders = ','.join(['%s'] * len(list_of_ids))\n\n# Construct the query using these placeholders\nquery = f\"DELETE FROM foo.bar WHERE baz IN ({placeholders})\"\n\n# Execute the query with the list_of_ids as the parameter\ncursor.execute(query, list_of_ids)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The `placeholders` string is created by joining a list of `%s` placeholders, one for each item in `list_of_ids`.\n- The `query` is constructed using these placeholders.\n- The `execute` method is called with the `query` and `list_of_ids` as arguments. The MySQLDB library will replace each `%s` in the query with the corresponding value from `list_of_ids`, safely handling any necessary quoting or escaping.\n\nThis method ensures that each ID is properly escaped and prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities."
