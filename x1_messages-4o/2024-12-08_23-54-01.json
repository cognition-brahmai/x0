        "content": "Creating an exercise routine using LaTeX, which is a typesetting system, might be a bit unconventional as LaTeX is not typically used for exercise routines. However, I can certainly help you create a simple and clear document in LaTeX to outline a safe and effective exercise routine for your friend's shoulder recovery. Below is a basic template for a LaTeX document that includes an exercise routine:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\n\\title{Shoulder Injury Recovery Exercise Routine}\n\\author{Your Friend's Name}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\maketitle\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nThis exercise routine is designed to aid recovery from a shoulder injury. It is important to consult a healthcare professional before beginning any new exercise program.\n\n\\section{Warm-Up}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Shoulder Circles:} Stand with feet shoulder-width apart. Gently rotate shoulders in a circular motion for 1-2 minutes.\n    \\item \\textbf{Neck Stretches:} Tilt head towards each shoulder, holding for 10-15 seconds on each side.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{Exercises}\n\\subsection{Pendulum Exercise}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Lean forward slightly, letting the injured arm hang down.\n    \\item Swing the arm gently in small circles or back and forth.\n    \\item Perform for 1-2 minutes, 2-3 times a day.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection{Towel Stretch}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Hold a towel behind your back with one hand and grab the opposite end with the other hand.\n    \\item Pull the towel gently with the top hand to stretch the shoulder.\n    \\item Hold for 15-30 seconds and repeat 3 times.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection{Shoulder Blade Squeeze}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Sit or stand with your arms at your sides.\n    \\item Squeeze the shoulder blades together and hold for 5 seconds.\n    \\item Repeat for 10 repetitions, 2-3 times a day.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{Cool Down}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Arm Across Chest Stretch:} Bring the injured arm across the chest and hold with the opposite arm. Hold for 15-30 seconds, repeat 3 times.\n    \\item \\textbf{Deep Breathing:} Take slow, deep breaths to relax the muscles.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nRemember to listen to your body and stop any exercise if you experience pain. Gradually increase the intensity of exercises as recovery progresses.\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nThis document provides a structured routine with gentle exercises that are generally considered safe for shoulder recovery. Make sure your friend consults with a healthcare professional to tailor these exercises to their specific needs and injury."
