I have been adding constants to settings.py but every time I make a change locally, I have to replicate the same on the production server and make production-specific edits. Some settings like paths to static files need to remain different and should not be overwritten when new code is deployed. Is there a standard or recommended way to handle this?"

        "content": "Managing settings for both local development and production environments in Django can be streamlined by using a modular approach. Here's a recommended approach:\n\n### 1. Separate Settings Files\n\nDivide your settings into multiple files. Commonly, you might have:\n\n- `settings/\n  - __init__.py`\n  - `base.py`: Contains settings common to all environments.\n  - `development.py`: Contains settings specific to the development environment.\n  - `production.py`: Contains settings specific to the production environment.\n\n### 2. Use Environment Variables\n\nUtilize environment variables to manage sensitive information and determine which settings file to use. This can be done using Python's `os` module:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nENVIRONMENT = os.getenv('DJANGO_ENV', 'development')\n\nif ENVIRONMENT == 'development':\n    from .development import *\nelif ENVIRONMENT == 'production':\n    from .production import *\nelse:\n    from .base import *\n```\n\n### 3. Example Structure\n\n**base.py**\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Common settings\nBASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))\nSECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY', 'your-default-secret-key')\nDEBUG = False\nALLOWED_HOSTS = ['yourdomain.com']\n\n# Common database settings\nDATABASES = {\n    'default': {\n        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',\n        'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**development.py**\n```python\nfrom .base import *\n\nDEBUG = True\nALLOWED_HOSTS = []\n\n# Development-specific settings\nDATABASES['default']['NAME'] = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'dev.sqlite3')\n```\n\n**production.py**\n```python\nfrom .base import *\n\nDEBUG = False\nALLOWED_HOSTS = ['yourdomain.com']\n\n# Production-specific settings\nDATABASES = {\n    'default': {\n        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',\n        'NAME': 'prod_db',\n        'USER': 'prod_user',\n        'PASSWORD': os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD'),\n        'HOST': 'localhost',\n        'PORT': '5432',\n    }\n}\n\n# Static files (production)\nSTATIC_ROOT = '/var/www/yourproject/static/'\n```\n\n### 4. Use Django-environ\n\nConsider using `django-environ` to manage environment variables more effectively. This package allows you to define environment variables in a `.env` file, making it easier to manage different settings.\n\n### 5. Deployment\n\nWhen deploying, ensure that the `DJANGO_ENV` environment variable is set to `production` on your server, so that the correct settings file is used.\n\n### 6. Security\n\nAlways ensure that sensitive information like `SECRET_KEY`, database passwords, and API keys are not hardcoded in your settings files. Use environment variables for these.\n\nBy modularizing your settings and using environment variables, you can easily manage different configurations for local and production environments without duplication or risk of overwriting production settings."
