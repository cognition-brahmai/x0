        "content": "To find the sum of all positive integers less than 100 that have exactly three distinct positive divisors, we need to understand the condition of having exactly three divisors. A number \\( n \\) will have exactly three distinct positive divisors if it is the square of a prime number. This is because if \\( n = p^2 \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime, then the divisors of \\( n \\) are \\( 1, p, \\) and \\( p^2 \\).\n\nLet's find the prime numbers \\( p \\) such that \\( p^2 < 100 \\):\n\n1. \\( p = 2 \\), \\( p^2 = 4 \\)\n2. \\( p = 3 \\), \\( p^2 = 9 \\)\n3. \\( p = 5 \\), \\( p^2 = 25 \\)\n4. \\( p = 7 \\), \\( p^2 = 49 \\)\n\nChecking the next prime number:\n- \\( p = 11 \\), \\( p^2 = 121 \\) (which is greater than 100)\n\nThus, the numbers less than 100 with exactly three distinct positive divisors are \\( 4, 9, 25, \\) and \\( 49 \\).\n\nNow, let's calculate their sum:\n\n\\[ 4 + 9 + 25 + 49 = 87 \\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of all positive integers less than 100 that have exactly three distinct positive divisors is \\( 87 \\)."
