Could anyone provide guidance on how to achieve this?"

        "content": "To save multiple figures into a single PDF file using Python, you can use the `PdfPages` class from the `matplotlib.backends.backend_pdf` module. This allows you to add multiple figures to a single PDF document. Unfortunately, creating a single JPG file with multiple images in a similar manner isn't directly supported, as JPGs are individual images. However, you can combine multiple images into a single image using libraries like PIL (Python Imaging Library).\n\nHere's how you can save multiple figures into a single PDF file:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib.backends.backend_pdf import PdfPages\n\n# Create some sample figures\nfig1, ax1 = plt.subplots()\nax1.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])\nax1.set_title('Figure 1')\n\nfig2, ax2 = plt.subplots()\nax2.plot([1, 2, 3], [6, 5, 4])\nax2.set_title('Figure 2')\n\n# Create a PdfPages object\nwith PdfPages('multipage_pdf.pdf') as pdf:\n    # Save each figure into the PDF\n    pdf.savefig(fig1)\n    pdf.savefig(fig2)\n\n# Close the figures if you don't need them anymore\nplt.close(fig1)\nplt.close(fig2)\n```\n\nFor combining multiple figures into a single JPG file, you can use the PIL library to concatenate images vertically or horizontally. Here's an example of how you can do that:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Create and save some sample figures\nfig1, ax1 = plt.subplots()\nax1.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])\nax1.set_title('Figure 1')\nfig1.savefig('fig1.jpg')\nplt.close(fig1)\n\nfig2, ax2 = plt.subplots()\nax2.plot([1, 2, 3], [6, 5, 4])\nax2.set_title('Figure 2')\nfig2.savefig('fig2.jpg')\nplt.close(fig2)\n\n# Open the saved images\nimages = [Image.open(x) for x in ['fig1.jpg', 'fig2.jpg']]\n\n# Combine images side by side\n# If you want them vertically, change the dimensions accordingly\nwidths, heights = zip(*(i.size for i in images))\n\ntotal_width = sum(widths)\nmax_height = max(heights)\n\ncombined_image = Image.new('RGB', (total_width, max_height))\n\nx_offset = 0\nfor im in images:\n    combined_image.paste(im, (x_offset, 0))\n    x_offset += im.size[0]\n\n# Save the combined image\ncombined_image.save('combined_image.jpg')\n```\n\nThis script will place the images side by side in a single JPG file. You can adjust the code to stack them vertically if needed by modifying the dimensions and offsets accordingly."
