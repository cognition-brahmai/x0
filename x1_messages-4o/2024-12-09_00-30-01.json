I need to retrieve all objects from model `A` that have less than two objects from model `B` pointing at them. The models are defined as follows:\n\n```python\nclass A(models.Model):\n  title = models.CharField(max_length=20)\n  (...)\n\nclass B(models.Model):\n  date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)\n  (...)\n  a = models.ForeignKey(A)\n```\nIn this scenario, model `A` represents a pool and model `B` represents users joining the pool. I don't want to display the pool if it has zero or just one user. Is it possible to achieve this with the current model design or do I need to modify my models?"

Here's how you can retrieve all objects from model `A` that have less than two objects from model `B` pointing at them:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db.models import Count\nfrom your_app.models import A, B\n\n# Annotate each A object with the count of related B objects\npools_with_user_count = A.objects.annotate(user_count=Count('b'))\n\n# Filter to get pools with less than two users\npools_with_fewer_than_two_users = pools_with_user_count.filter(user_count__lt=2)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1. `annotate(user_count=Count('b'))` adds an annotation to each `A` object, which counts the number of related `B` objects.\n2. `filter(user_count__lt=2)` filters the annotated `A` objects to include only those with fewer than two related `B` objects.\n\nThis way, you can retrieve all pools that have zero or just one user without needing to alter your existing model structure."
