In the function, `f( i, d={}, x=3 )`, I am adding a key-value pair to the dictionary `d` and incrementing the value of `x` by `i`. However, when I call the function multiple times, it seems that the dictionary `d` is not being re-initialized to an empty dictionary, but instead retains the values from the previous function call, while `x` is being reset to three on each call. I believed that keyword arguments are in the local scope of the function and would be deleted once the function returned. Can you help me understand what's going on?\n\n<pre><code>\n>>> def f( i, d={}, x=3 ) :\n...     d[i] = i*i\n...     x += i\n...     return x, d\n... \n>>> f( 2 )\n(5, {2: 4})\n\n>>> f(3)\n(6, {2: 4, 3: 9})\n</code></pre>"

        "content": "This behavior you're observing is due to how default mutable arguments are handled in Python functions. When you use a mutable object, such as a dictionary or list, as a default argument, it is created once when the function is defined, not each time the function is called. This means that the same object is used across all calls to the function, unless explicitly overridden.\n\nHere's what's happening in your function `f`:\n\n1. The first time you call `f(2)`, the default dictionary `d` is initialized as an empty dictionary `{}`. The function then adds the key-value pair `2: 4` to `d` and returns `(5, {2: 4})`.\n\n2. When you call `f(3)`, the same dictionary `d` from the previous call is used. Therefore, it already contains the key-value pair `2: 4`. The function adds another key-value pair `3: 9` to `d`, resulting in the dictionary `{2: 4, 3: 9}`.\n\nThe default value of `x`, however, is an immutable integer, so it is re-initialized to `3` on each call, which is why `x` behaves as you expect.\n\nTo avoid this issue, you can use `None` as the default value for `d` and then initialize it inside the function if it is `None`. Here's how you can modify your function:\n\n```python\ndef f(i, d=None, x=3):\n    if d is None:\n        d = {}\n    d[i] = i * i\n    x += i\n    return x, d\n\n# Now calling the function should behave as you expect:\nprint(f(2))  # (5, {2: 4})\nprint(f(3))  # (6, {3: 9})\n```\n\nBy doing this, a new dictionary is created for each call where `d` is not provided, ensuring that the function behaves as expected."
