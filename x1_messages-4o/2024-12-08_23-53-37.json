        "content": "Certainly! Here\u2019s a comprehensive list highlighting some intriguing details about Uranus:\n\n1. **Ice-Giant Composition**:  \n   Uranus is classified as an ice giant, which differentiates it from gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn. Its composition is primarily made up of water, ammonia, and methane ices, along with a small rocky core. This composition contributes to its unique characteristics and distinguishes it from other planets in the solar system.\n\n2. **27 Natural Satellites**:  \n   Uranus boasts 27 known natural satellites, each with unique features. Some of the most significant moons include Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. These moons vary in size and geological activity, with Miranda being particularly notable for its unusual surface features and dramatic cliffs.\n\n3. **Tilted Axis of Rotation**:  \n   One of Uranus\u2019s most distinctive features is its extreme axial tilt of about 98 degrees. This means the planet essentially rotates on its side. As a result, Uranus experiences extreme seasons, with each pole getting around 42 years of continuous sunlight or darkness at a time, significantly affecting the planet's atmospheric dynamics.\n\n4. **Blue-Green Hue**:  \n   The planet's striking blue-green color is due to the presence of methane in its upper atmosphere. Methane absorbs red light from the sun and reflects blue and green light, giving Uranus its characteristic hue. This coloring is a defining visual feature when observing the planet through telescopes.\n\n5. **Complex Ring System**:  \n   Uranus is surrounded by a complex system of rings, consisting of 13 known rings. These rings are much fainter and less substantial than those of Saturn and are primarily composed of dark, narrow bands of particles. They are believed to be relatively young and are thought to have originated from the remnants of moons shattered by collisions.\n\nThese features make Uranus a fascinating subject of study and provide insight into the diverse characteristics of planets within our solar system."
