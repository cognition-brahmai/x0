I have a function and an example OrderedDict as shown below:\n\n```python\ndef I_crave_order(**kwargs):\n    for k, v in kwargs.items():\n        print k, v\n\nexample = OrderedDict([('first', 1), ('second', 2), ('third', -1)])\n\nI_crave_order(**example)\n# Output:\n# first 1\n# second 2\n# third -1\n```\nHowever, the actual result I get is in a different order:\n\n```python\n# Output:\n# second 2\n# third -1\n# first 1\n```\nThe output seems to be in a typical random dict ordering. I have other uses where setting the order explicitly is good, so I want to keep **kwargs and not just pass the OrderedDict as a regular argument. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "The behavior you're experiencing is due to the way the `**kwargs` syntax works in Python. In versions of Python prior to 3.6, dictionaries did not maintain insertion order, so when you unpack an `OrderedDict` using `**kwargs`, the order could be lost because the underlying dictionary implementation used for `kwargs` did not preserve order.\n\nStarting with Python 3.6, the standard dictionary maintains insertion order as an implementation detail, and this behavior was officially guaranteed in Python 3.7. Therefore, if you're using Python 3.6 or later, the order should be preserved when you unpack an `OrderedDict` using `**kwargs`.\n\nHere's what you can do to ensure order is maintained:\n\n1. **Ensure you're using at least Python 3.6**: Verify your Python version is 3.6 or later, where the ordering behavior for standard dictionaries was introduced.\n\n2. **Check the version of your environment**: Sometimes, environments might still be using older Python versions. Make sure your environment is updated.\n\n3. **Use a workaround for older versions**: If you're stuck on an older version of Python, you can modify the function to accept the dictionary directly and iterate over it, like so:\n\n    ```python\n    def I_crave_order(ordered_dict):\n        for k, v in ordered_dict.items():\n            print(k, v)\n\n    example = OrderedDict([('first', 1), ('second', 2), ('third', -1)])\n\n    I_crave_order(example)\n    ```\n\nThis way, you directly pass the `OrderedDict` without unpacking it, ensuring the order is preserved regardless of the Python version."
