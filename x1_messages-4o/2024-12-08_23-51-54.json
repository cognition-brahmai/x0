What is the volume of the pyramid in cubic units? \nBut here's the twist: the numbers given in the problem are actually encoded using a simple substitution cipher. Use the following key to decode the numbers: \n4 = s \n5 = e \n6 = v \n7 = n \n8 = i \n9 = t \nWhat is the actual volume of the square pyramid in cubic units?"

        "content": "To solve the problem, we first need to decode the numbers using the provided cipher key:\n\n- Base side length of 5 units: 5 is encoded as 'e', which translates to the number 5.\n- Slant height of 7 units: 7 is encoded as 'n', which translates to the number 7.\n\nGiven that the slant height is not directly used to calculate the volume, we need to determine the actual height (altitude) of the pyramid. The slant height, base side length, and the height of the pyramid form a right triangle, where the slant height is the hypotenuse. The base side length is part of the base, so we use half of it (2.5 units) for calculations.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem:\n\\[\n\\text{Slant height}^2 = \\text{Height}^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\text{Base side length}}{2}\\right)^2\n\\]\n\\[\n7^2 = \\text{Height}^2 + (2.5)^2\n\\]\n\\[\n49 = \\text{Height}^2 + 6.25\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Height}^2 = 49 - 6.25\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Height}^2 = 42.75\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Height} = \\sqrt{42.75} \\approx 6.54\n\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the volume of the pyramid using the formula:\n\\[\n\\text{Volume} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Base Area} = \\text{Base side length}^2 = 5^2 = 25\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Volume} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 25 \\times 6.54 \\approx 54.5\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the volume of the pyramid is approximately 54.5 cubic units."
