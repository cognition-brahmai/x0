        "content": "How can I get the Mercurial revision number or ID (which is a hash, not a number) programmatically in Python? I need to do this so I can add it to the CSS/JS files on our website in the manner shown below. This ensures that whenever a change is made to the stylesheet, it will get a new URL and no longer use the old cached version. Alternatively, where can I find good documentation for the Mercurial Python module? \n\n```\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"example.css?{% mercurial_revision \"example.css\" %}\" />\n```\n\nI attempted to solve this issue by using subprocess to run a command that gets the hg node. I chose this solution because the API is not guaranteed to stay the same, but the bash interface probably will. Here's my solution:\n\n```\nimport subprocess\n\ndef get_hg_rev(file_path):\n    pipe = subprocess.Popen(\n        [\"hg\", \"log\", \"-l\", \"1\", \"--template\", \"{node}\", file_path],\n        stdout=subprocess.PIPE\n        )\n    return pipe.stdout.read()\n```\n\nThe command usage is:\n\n```\n> path_to_file = \"/home/jim/workspace/lgr/pinax/projects/lgr/site_media/base.css\"\n> get_hg_rev(path_to_file)\n'0ed525cf38a7b7f4f1321763d964a39327db97c4'\n```\n\nIs this the correct approach? Are there any improvements that can be made or alternative solutions?"

        "content": "Your approach using `subprocess` is valid and commonly used when interacting with version control systems like Mercurial from within Python. It allows you to execute shell commands and capture their output. Here are a few suggestions and improvements you might consider:\n\n### Improvements to Your Approach\n\n1. **Error Handling:**\n   Ensure you handle errors that might occur if the command fails. This can be achieved by checking the return code and capturing any error messages.\n\n2. **Decoding Output:**\n   The output of `pipe.stdout.read()` is in bytes, so it's good practice to decode it to a string.\n\n3. **Using `subprocess.run`:**\n   The `subprocess.run` function is a higher-level API introduced in Python 3.5, which can be more convenient than `Popen`.\n\nHere is a refined version of your function incorporating these suggestions:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\ndef get_hg_rev(file_path):\n    try:\n        result = subprocess.run(\n            [\"hg\", \"log\", \"-l\", \"1\", \"--template\", \"{node}\", file_path],\n            check=True,\n            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,\n            stderr=subprocess.PIPE\n        )\n        return result.stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:\n        print(f\"Error occurred: {e.stderr.decode('utf-8')}\")\n        return None\n\n# Example usage\npath_to_file = \"/home/jim/workspace/lgr/pinax/projects/lgr/site_media/base.css\"\nrevision = get_hg_rev(path_to_file)\nprint(revision)\n```\n\n### Alternative Solutions\n\n1. **Mercurial Python API:**\n   If you want to avoid using subprocess, you can use the Mercurial API directly. This can be more efficient and provide better integration with Python, but it requires familiarity with the Mercurial internals.\n\n   ```python\n   from mercurial import ui, hg, commands\n\n   def get_hg_rev_repo(repo_path, file_path):\n       repo = hg.repository(ui.ui(), repo_path)\n       ctx = repo['.']  # Get the current context\n       file_ctx = ctx[file_path]\n       return file_ctx.hex()\n\n   # Example usage\n   repo_path = \"/home/jim/workspace/lgr/pinax/projects/lgr\"\n   file_path = \"site_media/base.css\"\n   revision = get_hg_rev_repo(repo_path, file_path)\n   print(revision)\n   ```\n\n   **Note:** The Mercurial API can change between versions, so ensure compatibility with your installed version.\n\n2. **Documentation:**\n   For documentation on the Mercurial Python module, you can refer to the [Mercurial API documentation](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/doc/hg.1.html) and [Mercurial source code](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/repo/hg/file/tip) for examples and details on available functions.\n\nChoose the method that best fits your project's needs, considering factors like maintainability, efficiency, and ease of use."
