I've been using the @login_required decorator throughout my app, but sometimes I forget to add it and it's not always evident when I do. I thought of reversing the system, using something like @public just for the public views, but I couldn't seem to get it to work with middleware or traversing the URL patterns to check that everything that's not @public is marked @login_required. Can someone suggest the right way to handle this?"

        "content": "To make Django's `@login_required` decorator the default behavior for your views, you can create a custom middleware that checks if a user is authenticated for all views by default, and then use a decorator like `@public` for the views that don't require authentication. Here's a way to implement this:\n\n1. **Create a custom middleware:**\n\n   You can create a custom middleware that will check if the user is authenticated for every request. If not, it can redirect them to the login page.\n\n   ```python\n   # middleware.py\n\n   from django.conf import settings\n   from django.shortcuts import redirect\n   from django.urls import resolve\n\n   class LoginRequiredMiddleware:\n       def __init__(self, get_response):\n           self.get_response = get_response\n\n       def __call__(self, request):\n           # Get the current URL name\n           url_name = resolve(request.path_info).url_name\n\n           # List of URLs that don't require authentication\n           public_urls = getattr(settings, 'PUBLIC_URLS', [])\n\n           # Check if the URL is public or if the user is authenticated\n           if url_name not in public_urls and not request.user.is_authenticated:\n               return redirect(settings.LOGIN_URL)\n\n           response = self.get_response(request)\n           return response\n   ```\n\n2. **Add the middleware to your Django settings:**\n\n   Add the middleware to your `MIDDLEWARE` setting in `settings.py`.\n\n   ```python\n   # settings.py\n\n   MIDDLEWARE = [\n       # ... other middleware ...\n       'yourapp.middleware.LoginRequiredMiddleware',\n       # ... other middleware ...\n   ]\n\n   # List of URL names that are public\n   PUBLIC_URLS = [\n       'public_view_name_1',\n       'public_view_name_2',\n       # Add more public view names here\n   ]\n\n   LOGIN_URL = '/login/'  # Update this to your login URL\n   ```\n\n3. **Use the `@public` decorator for public views:**\n\n   You can create a simple `@public` decorator that just adds the view's URL name to the `PUBLIC_URLS` list. This isn't strictly necessary with the middleware approach, but it can help you keep track of which views are public.\n\n   ```python\n   # decorators.py\n\n   def public(view_func):\n       view_func.public = True\n       return view_func\n   ```\n\n4. **Annotate public views with `@public`:**\n\n   Just use the `@public` decorator on the views that should be accessible without login.\n\n   ```python\n   # views.py\n\n   from yourapp.decorators import public\n\n   @public\n   def public_view(request):\n       # Your public view logic here\n       pass\n   ```\n\nBy implementing this middleware-based approach, you ensure that all views require authentication by default, and you only need to mark the exceptions with `@public`. This reduces the risk of forgetting to add `@login_required` and provides a centralized way to manage access control across your application."
