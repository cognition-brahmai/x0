I've tried uninstalling Geforce Experience from the Programs and Features windows panel as suggested in the CUDA forums, but the error persists. I believe this might be because the \"Nvidia Corporation\" folder was not removed. I've seen suggestions to do a custom install, but I can't find any information on how to do this. Can someone explain how to perform a custom install of the CUDA toolkit or safely remove the previous drivers?"

This tool is very effective in removing any traces of previous installations.\n\n4. **Download the Latest CUDA Toolkit:**\n   - Visit the official NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit download page and download the latest version suitable for your system.\n   - It's often helpful to download the installer manually rather than using the automatic downloader.\n\n5. **Perform a Custom Installation:**\n   - Start the CUDA installer.\n   - When you reach the installation options, choose \"Custom (Advanced)\" instead of \"Express (Recommended).\"\n   - In the custom installation, you will see individual components listed. You can choose to install only the CUDA Toolkit and deselect other components like the NVIDIA Frameview SDK, which might be causing conflicts.\n\n6. **Verify Installation:**\n   - After installation, verify that CUDA is installed correctly by opening a command prompt and typing `nvcc --version` to check the installed version of CUDA.\n\n7. **Reinstall Necessary Components:**\n   - If you need additional components like GeForce Experience, you can reinstall them separately after successfully installing the CUDA Toolkit.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to install the CUDA Toolkit without encountering the issue with the NVIDIA Frameview SDK. If you encounter any additional errors, it may be helpful to consult the NVIDIA Developer Forums for more specific guidance related to your configuration."
