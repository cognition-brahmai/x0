The methods I currently employ are:\n\n```python\nrotated = numpy.rot90(numpy.rot90(numpy.rot90(orignumpyarray)))\nrotated = numpy.fliplr(numpy.flipud(numpy.rot90(orignumpyarray)))\n```\n\nIs there a more efficient way to do this, perhaps with a single operation? Ideally, is there a function like `rot270()` that I can use?"

        "content": "To rotate a 2D NumPy array by 270 degrees, you can indeed achieve it more efficiently using a single operation. NumPy's `rot90()` function allows you to specify the number of times you want to rotate the array by 90 degrees. To rotate by 270 degrees, you can rotate it 90 degrees in the counter-clockwise direction or 3 times in the clockwise direction. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Rotate the array 270 degrees counter-clockwise (or 90 degrees clockwise)\nrotated = np.rot90(orignumpyarray, k=-1)\n\n# Alternatively, rotate the array 90 degrees clockwise 3 times\n# rotated = np.rot90(orignumpyarray, k=3)\n```\n\nBoth methods will provide the same result, and using `np.rot90()` with the `k` parameter is a more efficient and cleaner approach to achieve the desired rotation."
