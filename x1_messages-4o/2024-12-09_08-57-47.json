Subtract this minimum value from each element in the list.\n\nHere's a simple example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef normalize_by_minimum(input_list):\n    # Find the minimum value in the list\n    min_value = min(input_list)\n    \n    # Subtract the minimum value from each element in the list\n    normalized_list = [x - min_value for x in input_list]\n    \n    return normalized_list\n\n# Example usage\ninputs = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\nnormalized_inputs = normalize_by_minimum(inputs)\nprint(normalized_inputs)\n```\n\nIn this example, `inputs` is the list of numbers you want to normalize. The function `normalize_by_minimum` calculates the minimum value and creates a new list where each element has the minimum value subtracted from it. The result is stored in `normalized_inputs`, which is then printed out."
