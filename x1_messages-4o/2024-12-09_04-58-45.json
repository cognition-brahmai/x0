My understanding is that 'self' is used like a global variable to pass data between different methods in a class. However, I don't understand why I need to use 'self' when I'm calling another method in the same class. For instance, in the code below, why do I need 'self.thing()'?\n\n```python\nclass bla:\n    def hello(self):\n        self.thing()\n\n    def thing(self):\n        print \"hello\"\n```"

        "content": "The confusion around the use of `self` is quite common when you're first learning about object-oriented programming in Python. Let's break it down.\n\n1. **What is `self`?**\n   - `self` is a reference to the current instance of the class. It's how you access variables and methods that belong to the class instance. It's similar to `this` in other programming languages like Java or C++.\n   - When you define methods in a class, you need to include `self` as the first parameter of each method (except static methods). This parameter allows the method to access the instance calling it.\n\n2. **Why use `self`?**\n   - When you call a method using `self`, like `self.thing()`, you are telling Python to use the instance's method. This is important because you might have multiple instances of a class, each with its own state.\n\n3. **Why not call the method directly?**\n   - If you try to call `thing()` directly without `self`, Python will look for a function `thing` in the local or global scope, not the method within the class instance. Using `self.thing()` ensures that Python calls the method from the current instance of the class.\n\n4. **Example Explanation:**\n   - In your code:\n\n     ```python\n     class bla:\n         def hello(self):\n             self.thing()\n\n         def thing(self):\n             print(\"hello\")\n     ```\n\n     - When you create an instance of `bla` and call `hello()` on it, `self` refers to that particular instance. By calling `self.thing()`, you're ensuring that the `thing` method of that instance is executed, which prints \"hello\".\n\nIn summary, `self` is essential for accessing attributes and methods of the current class instance, ensuring that each instance can maintain its own state and behavior."
