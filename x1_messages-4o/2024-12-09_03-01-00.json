        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to a mismatch in the expected input dimensions for the `SimpleRNN` layer. RNN layers in Keras expect inputs with three dimensions: `(batch_size, timesteps, input_dim)`, where `timesteps` is the number of time steps and `input_dim` is the dimensionality of the input at each time step. However, the `Dense` layers you're using output a 2D tensor of shape `(batch_size, units)`, which is incompatible with the expected input for the `SimpleRNN` layer.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to reshape the output of the last `Dense` layer to be 3D before passing it to the `SimpleRNN` layer. Here's how you can modify your code to do this:\n\n```python\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense, SimpleRNN, Reshape\nfrom keras import optimizers as OP\n\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(Dense(150, input_dim=23, kernel_initializer='normal', activation='relu'))\nmodel.add(Dense(80, kernel_initializer='normal', activation='relu'))\n\n# Reshape the output to 3D for the RNN layer\nmodel.add(Reshape((1, 80)))\n\nmodel.add(SimpleRNN(2, kernel_initializer='normal'))\n\n# Use the Adam optimizer\nadam = OP.Adam(lr=0.001, beta_1=0.9, beta_2=0.999, epsilon=1e-08)\n\n# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer=adam)\n\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Reshape Layer**: Added a `Reshape` layer to convert the 2D output of the last `Dense` layer into a 3D shape suitable for the `SimpleRNN` layer. In this example, the shape `(1, 80)` is used, assuming you want a single timestep with 80 features. You can adjust the shape based on your actual requirements.\n\n2. **Optimizer**: Changed the optimizer in the `compile` method to use the `adam` optimizer you defined.\n\nThese adjustments should resolve the error and allow your model to be compiled successfully."
