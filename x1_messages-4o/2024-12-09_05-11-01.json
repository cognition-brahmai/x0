While it works as expected at a primary level, I am encountering issues when I want to use it multiple times within the same program to write different things to different files. It seems that upon closing, sys.stdout also closes, which then prevents subsequent printing or reusing this class. Despite trying to reimport sys and other methods, I am unable to get it to function as needed. How can I modify this code to allow for multiple uses within the same program? \n\nHere's the code I am referring to:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nclass MyWriter:\n\n    def __init__(self, stdout, filename):\n        self.stdout = stdout\n        self.logfile = file(filename, 'a')\n\n    def write(self, text):\n        self.stdout.write(text)\n        self.logfile.write(text)\n\n    def close(self):\n        self.stdout.close()\n        self.logfile.close()\n\nwriter = MyWriter(sys.stdout, 'log.txt')\nsys.stdout = writer\n\nprint 'test' \n```"

        "content": "The issue you are encountering stems from closing `sys.stdout` within your `MyWriter` class. When you close `sys.stdout`, it can no longer be used, and re-importing `sys` does not reset `sys.stdout`.\n\nTo address this problem, you can modify your code to avoid closing `sys.stdout` directly. Instead, only close the logfile. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Avoid closing `sys.stdout`**: Modify the `close` method to only close the logfile.\n2. **Use a context manager**: Implement the context manager to ensure that the logfile is properly closed after use.\n3. **Reset `sys.stdout`**: Ensure `sys.stdout` is set back to its original state after using the custom writer.\n\nHere's the modified code:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nclass MyWriter:\n    def __init__(self, stdout, filename):\n        self.stdout = stdout\n        self.logfile = open(filename, 'a')  # Use open() instead of file() for compatibility\n\n    def write(self, text):\n        self.stdout.write(text)\n        self.logfile.write(text)\n\n    def close(self):\n        self.logfile.close()\n\n    def flush(self):\n        self.stdout.flush()\n        self.logfile.flush()\n\n# Function to use MyWriter with context management\ndef use_writer(filename):\n    original_stdout = sys.stdout  # Save the original sys.stdout\n    writer = MyWriter(sys.stdout, filename)\n    sys.stdout = writer\n    try:\n        yield\n    finally:\n        sys.stdout = original_stdout  # Reset sys.stdout to its original state\n        writer.close()\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    with use_writer('log1.txt'):\n        print('This will be written to log1.txt and printed to the screen')\n    \n    with use_writer('log2.txt'):\n        print('This will be written to log2.txt and printed to the screen')\n```\n\nIn this revised code:\n\n- The `close` method only closes the logfile.\n- The `MyWriter` class is used within the `use_writer` function, which acts as a context manager.\n- `sys.stdout` is reset to its original value after exiting the context, allowing you to reuse the class multiple times in the same program.\n- The `flush` method is added to ensure buffered output is properly written.\n- The `open` function is used instead of `file`, as `file` is not available in Python 3 and `open` works in both Python 2 and 3."
