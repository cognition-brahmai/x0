However, my code seems to always return `True` regardless of the presence of the string. The code I am using is:\n\n```python\ndef check():\n    datafile = file('example.txt')\n    found = False\n    for line in datafile:\n        if blabla in line:\n            found = True\n            break\n\ncheck()\nif True:\n    print \"true\"\nelse:\n    print \"false\"\n```\nCan anyone identify what is going wrong here?"

        "content": "The issue with your code lies in the way you are checking the condition after calling the `check()` function. The `check()` function updates the `found` variable inside its scope, but it doesn't return anything, so the `if True:` statement always evaluates to `True`, which is why the code always prints \"true\".\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to make it work:\n\n1. Return the `found` variable from the `check()` function.\n2. Use the returned value to determine the output.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef check():\n    with open('example.txt', 'r') as datafile:\n        for line in datafile:\n            if 'blabla' in line:  # Ensure 'blabla' is a string\n                return True\n    return False\n\nif check():\n    print(\"true\")\nelse:\n    print(\"false\")\n```\n\nChanges made:\n\n- Use `with open(...)` instead of `file(...)` for better file handling.\n- Ensure `'blabla'` is a string by enclosing it in quotes.\n- Return `True` if the string is found, otherwise return `False`.\n- Use the returned value from `check()` to determine whether to print \"true\" or \"false\"."
