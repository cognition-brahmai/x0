However, when I run the project on my Raspberry Pi after installing all the requirements, the project fails with the following error: \"AttributeError: type object 'SessionViewSet' has no attribute 'get_extra_actions'\". My views.py and urls.py are as follows:\n\nviews.py:\n```python\nfrom django.shortcuts import render\n\nfrom rest_framework import viewsets\nfrom .models import Session\nfrom .serializers import SessionSerializer\n\nfrom rest_framework.views import APIView, Response\n\n\nclass SessionViewSet(APIView):\n    queryset = Session.objects.all()\n    serializer_class = SessionSerializer\n\n    def get(self, request, format=None):\n        return Response(\"test\")\n```\n\nurls.py:\n```python\nfrom django.conf.urls import url\nfrom rest_framework import routers\nfrom openvpnmonitor.api.views import SessionViewSet\n\nrouter = routers.DefaultRouter()\nrouter.register(r'sessions', SessionViewSet)\n\nurlpatterns = [\n    url(r'sessions', SessionViewSet.as_view()),\n    url(r'^docs/', schema_view),\n]\n\nurlpatterns += router.urls\n```\n\nWhy is this error happening, and how can I fix it?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"AttributeError: type object 'SessionViewSet' has no attribute 'get_extra_actions'\", is related to a mismatch in the way you've set up your `SessionViewSet` class. You're using the `APIView` class from Django REST Framework, which doesn't have the `get_extra_actions` method. This method is expected when you use viewsets with routers.\n\nHere's how you can fix this:\n\n1. **Correct the ViewSet Class**: Instead of inheriting from `APIView`, you should inherit from `viewsets.ModelViewSet` or `viewsets.GenericViewSet` with appropriate mixins if you're using routers. This will provide the necessary methods and attributes that the router expects.\n\n2. **Fix the URLs**: Since you're using a router, you don't need to manually add the `SessionViewSet` to `urlpatterns`, as the router will handle that for you.\n\nHere is how you can update your code:\n\n### `views.py`\n```python\nfrom rest_framework import viewsets\nfrom .models import Session\nfrom .serializers import SessionSerializer\n\nclass SessionViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):\n    queryset = Session.objects.all()\n    serializer_class = SessionSerializer\n```\n\n### `urls.py`\n```python\nfrom django.urls import path, include\nfrom rest_framework import routers\nfrom openvpnmonitor.api.views import SessionViewSet\n\nrouter = routers.DefaultRouter()\nrouter.register(r'sessions', SessionViewSet, basename='session')\n\nurlpatterns = [\n    path('', include(router.urls)),\n    path('docs/', schema_view),\n]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **ViewSet**: By using `viewsets.ModelViewSet`, you gain all the CRUD operations (create, retrieve, update, delete) automatically, which are compatible with the router.\n- **Router**: The `DefaultRouter` automatically generates URL patterns for your viewset. By using `path('', include(router.urls))`, you're including all the routes generated by the router.\n\nThis setup should resolve the error and allow your API to function correctly on your Raspberry Pi. If you have additional custom logic or endpoints, you can add them as methods within the `SessionViewSet` class."
