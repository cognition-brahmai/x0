I have tried using the syntax 'df[df.dt_mvmt == None].count()' and 'df[df.dt_mvmt != None].count()', but it doesn't work and returns 0 count even though there are values in each category. Here's an example of my dataframe:\n\n```python\ndf.select('dt_mvmt').distinct().collect()\n\n[Row(dt_mvmt=u'2016-03-27'),\n Row(dt_mvmt=u'2016-03-28'),\n Row(dt_mvmt=u'2016-03-29'),\n Row(dt_mvmt=None),\n Row(dt_mvmt=u'2016-03-30'),\n Row(dt_mvmt=u'2016-03-31')]\n```\n\nAnd here's my filtering code:\n\n```python\ndf[df.dt_mvmt == '2016-03-31']\n# some results here\n\ndf[df.dt_mvmt == None].count()\n# returns 0\n\ndf[df.dt_mvmt != None].count()\n# returns 0\n```"

        "content": "In PySpark, when dealing with `None` (which is analogous to SQL's `NULL`), you cannot use the standard equality operators (`==` or `!=`) for filtering. Instead, you should use the `isNull()` and `isNotNull()` methods provided by PySpark to filter rows with `None` values. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n1. **Filter for `None` values using `isNull()`:**\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col\n\n# Filter rows where 'dt_mvmt' is None\nnull_count = df.filter(col(\"dt_mvmt\").isNull()).count()\nprint(\"Count of rows with None:\", null_count)\n```\n\n2. **Filter for non-`None` values using `isNotNull()`:**\n\n```python\n# Filter rows where 'dt_mvmt' is not None\nnot_null_count = df.filter(col(\"dt_mvmt\").isNotNull()).count()\nprint(\"Count of rows without None:\", not_null_count)\n```\n\nThese methods are specifically designed to handle `None` and `NULL` values in a PySpark DataFrame and should give you the expected results."
