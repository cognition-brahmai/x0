I have been using the `platform.platform` function, but it only returns a string. I am unsure what to look for in this string to obtain a reliable result. Is there a specific string I should search for, or is there a different function that would be more appropriate for this task?"

        "content": "To ensure that your Python tools are running on a Linux system, you can use the `platform` module to check the operating system type. Instead of relying on `platform.platform()`, which returns a detailed string, you can use `platform.system()` or `os.name` for a more straightforward approach. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using `platform.system()`**:\n   This function returns a string that represents the operating system. For Linux, it typically returns `'Linux'`. You can use this to check if the system is Linux.\n\n   ```python\n   import platform\n\n   if platform.system() != 'Linux':\n       raise EnvironmentError(\"This tool can only be installed on a Linux system.\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Using `os.name`**:\n   The `os` module provides a simpler way to check the operating system. For POSIX-compliant systems (which includes Linux), `os.name` returns `'posix'`.\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n\n   if os.name != 'posix':\n       raise EnvironmentError(\"This tool can only be installed on a Linux system.\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Using `sys.platform`**:\n   You can also use `sys.platform`, which provides a more detailed string. For Linux, it usually starts with `'linux'`.\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n\n   if not sys.platform.startswith('linux'):\n       raise EnvironmentError(\"This tool can only be installed on a Linux system.\")\n   ```\n\nThese methods will help you ensure that your Python tools are being run on a Linux system, thereby avoiding installation on incompatible platforms like Windows. Choose the one that best fits your needs."
