In other languages, I can define a class like this:\n\n```csharp\npublic class Team {\n     private String name;\n     private String logo;\n     private int members;\n\n     public Team(){}\n\n     // Getters/setters\n}\n```\n\nAnd then use it as follows:\n\n```csharp\nTeam team = new Team();\nteam.setName(\"Oscar\");\nteam.setLogo(\"http://....\");\nteam.setMembers(10);\n```\n\nI've tried to do this in Python like so:\n\n```python\nclass Team:\n    pass\n```\n\nAnd then use it as:\n\n```python\nteam = Team()\nteam.name = \"Oscar\"\nteam.logo = \"http://...\"\nteam.members = 10\n```\n\nHowever, this feels a bit odd to me, especially after coming from a strongly typed language. Is this the correct way to define a class in Python?"

        "content": "Yes, you've got the basic idea right, but Python offers more structured ways to define classes and handle properties, especially if you're coming from a language like C#. Let's walk through a more idiomatic approach to defining a class in Python with encapsulation similar to what you're used to.\n\nIn Python, you can define a class with an `__init__` method to initialize the properties, and you can use property decorators to create getters and setters if you want more control over access to the attributes. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nclass Team:\n    def __init__(self, name=None, logo=None, members=0):\n        self._name = name\n        self._logo = logo\n        self._members = members\n\n    @property\n    def name(self):\n        return self._name\n\n    @name.setter\n    def name(self, value):\n        self._name = value\n\n    @property\n    def logo(self):\n        return self._logo\n\n    @logo.setter\n    def logo(self, value):\n        self._logo = value\n\n    @property\n    def members(self):\n        return self._members\n\n    @members.setter\n    def members(self, value):\n        self._members = value\n\n# Usage\nteam = Team()\nteam.name = \"Oscar\"\nteam.logo = \"http://...\"\nteam.members = 10\n\nprint(f\"Team Name: {team.name}\")\nprint(f\"Team Logo: {team.logo}\")\nprint(f\"Team Members: {team.members}\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **`__init__` Method**: This is the constructor for the class. You can set default values for the properties.\n\n2. **Properties with Decorators**: The `@property` decorator is used to define a getter method, and `@<property_name>.setter` is used to define the setter method. This way, you have control over how properties are accessed and modified.\n\n3. **Encapsulation**: By convention, attributes with a single underscore (e.g., `_name`) are considered \"protected\" and should not be accessed directly outside the class. This is a way to suggest that these attributes are intended for internal use.\n\n4. **Usage**: You can create an instance of the class and use the properties just like in your C# example.\n\nThis approach provides a balance between Python's dynamic nature and the encapsulation you're accustomed to in strongly-typed languages."
