        "content": "It seems like your Jupyter Notebook is trying to use a Python environment that no longer exists, specifically an environment from Anaconda that you have removed. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Current Environment:**\n   - Ensure that you are using the correct version of Python and Jupyter that are installed system-wide or in the desired environment.\n\n2. **Reinstall Jupyter:**\n   - If you want to use a specific Python version, make sure Jupyter is installed in that environment. You can create a new virtual environment and install Jupyter within it:\n     ```bash\n     python3 -m venv myenv\n     source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `myenv\\Scripts\\activate`\n     pip install jupyter matplotlib\n     ```\n\n3. **Set the Kernel:**\n   - You need to set Jupyter to use the correct Python kernel. After activating your virtual environment, you can add it to Jupyter:\n     ```bash\n     python -m ipykernel install --user --name=myenv\n     ```\n\n4. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**\n   - Start Jupyter Notebook from within your virtual environment:\n     ```bash\n     jupyter notebook\n     ```\n\n5. **Update Kernel List:**\n   - If Jupyter is still trying to use the old kernel, you can remove it from the kernel list:\n     - Locate the kernel specification directory, typically found in `~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/` or `/usr/local/share/jupyter/kernels/`.\n     - Remove any directories related to the unwanted kernel.\n\n6. **Check Path and Permissions:**\n   - Make sure your `$PATH` is correctly set to prioritize the Python and Jupyter installations you want to use.\n   - You can check and modify your path by editing your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`).\n\n7. **Verify Installation:**\n   - Run the following commands to verify installations:\n     ```bash\n     which python\n     which jupyter\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the kernel error and successfully import packages like `matplotlib` without issues."
