For example, if I have a line like this: 1997,Ford,E350,\"Super, luxurious truck\", it should be split as ('1997', 'Ford', 'E350', 'Super, luxurious truck') and not as ('1997', 'Ford', 'E350', '\"Super', ' luxurious truck\"'). This is what I get when I use str.split(,). How can I do this? Also, what would be the best way to store these values? I want to be able to easily select any two of the columns from the CSV file and store it in a different data structure."

        "content": "To correctly parse a CSV file while recognizing quoted values, you should use Python's built-in `csv` module, which is specifically designed to handle CSV files and can manage quoted values properly.\n\nHere's a basic example of how you can use the `csv` module to parse a CSV file:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\n# Open your CSV file\nwith open('your_file.csv', mode='r', newline='') as file:\n    # Create a CSV reader object\n    csv_reader = csv.reader(file, delimiter=',', quotechar='\"')\n    \n    # Iterate over each row in the CSV file\n    for row in csv_reader:\n        # Each row is a list of strings\n        print(row)\n```\n\nThis will correctly parse lines like `1997,Ford,E350,\"Super, luxurious truck\"` into `['1997', 'Ford', 'E350', 'Super, luxurious truck']`.\n\nTo store these values and be able to easily select any two columns, you can use a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row with column headers as keys. Alternatively, you can use a library like `pandas` which provides a DataFrame object for more advanced data manipulation.\n\nHere's an example using `pandas`:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the CSV file into a DataFrame\ndf = pd.read_csv('your_file.csv')\n\n# Print the entire DataFrame\nprint(df)\n\n# Select any two columns, for example 'Year' and 'Model'\nselected_columns = df[['Year', 'Model']]\n\n# Print the selected columns\nprint(selected_columns)\n```\n\nIn this example, replace `'Year'` and `'Model'` with the actual column headers in your CSV file. The `pandas` library is very powerful for data manipulation and analysis, and it's widely used in data science and engineering tasks. You can install it using `pip` if it's not already installed:\n\n```bash\npip install pandas\n```\n\nUsing `pandas`, you can perform a wide range of operations on your data, making it a great choice for handling CSV files and other data formats."
