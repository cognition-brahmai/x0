I noticed that np.abs is defined via `from .numeric import absolute as abs`, which seems to be in violation of the zen of python principle: \"There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\" I have personally been using np.abs in almost all of my code and based on search results for np.abs vs np.absolute on Stack Overflow, it seems like an overwhelming majority does the same. Is there any reason I should preferentially use np.absolute over np.abs in my code, or should I simply go for the more \"standard\" np.abs?"

        "content": "In the context of using NumPy, both `np.abs` and `np.absolute` are functionally identical, and there is no performance difference between them. The choice between the two largely comes down to readability and personal preference.\n\nHere are a few considerations that might help you decide which one to use consistently:\n\n1. **Readability**: `np.abs` is shorter and perhaps more intuitive, especially if you are familiar with the built-in Python `abs()` function. This might make the code easier to read for people who are familiar with Python in general but not necessarily with NumPy.\n\n2. **Consistency**: If you are working in a team or contributing to a larger codebase, it's a good idea to follow the conventions used in that codebase. If most of the code uses `np.abs`, it would make sense to continue using it for consistency.\n\n3. **Community Standard**: As you noted, `np.abs` seems to be more commonly used in the community. Sticking with community norms can make your code more accessible to others who might read or contribute to it.\n\n4. **Zen of Python**: The Zen of Python suggests that there should be one obvious way to do something. However, it doesn't strictly enforce it, and aliases are common in many libraries for convenience and familiarity. In practice, both `np.abs` and `np.absolute` exist to cater to different preferences.\n\nIn conclusion, there is no strong technical reason to prefer one over the other, so you should feel free to use `np.abs` if that is what you are comfortable with and if it aligns with your coding style or team standards."
