        "content": "In Python, the `list.append` method is designed to modify the list in place by adding an element to the end of the list. Its primary purpose is to perform this action, and it doesn't need to return any value. By default, if a Python function or method doesn't explicitly return a value, it implicitly returns `None`.\n\nIn Python, `None` is treated as `False` in a boolean context. Therefore, when you use `not u.append(6)`, you are effectively evaluating `not None`, which results in `True`.\n\nThis behavior is not directly related to the C convention of returning 0 for success and non-zero for error. In Python, the use of `None` as a return value for methods that primarily serve to modify objects in place is a convention signaling that the function's main purpose is its side effect (modifying the object) rather than producing a return value.\n\nIn summary, the `list.append` method returns `None` to indicate that its role is to modify the list, and by doing so, it follows the general Python convention for methods that operate through side effects. This is why `not u.append(6)` evaluates to `True`."
