Should I follow the first example where there is no blank line after the function definition:\n\n```python\ndef hello_function():\n    return 'hello'\n```\n\nor should I follow the second example where there is a blank line after the function definition:\n\n```python\ndef hello_function():\n\n    return 'hello'\n```\n\nThe same question applies when docstrings are used. Should I follow the first example:\n\n```python\ndef hello_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    Important function\n    \"\"\"\n    return 'hello'\n```\n\nor the second example:\n\n```python\ndef hello_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    Important function\n    \"\"\"\n\n    return 'hello'\n```\n\nThe PEP guidelines mention the following about blank lines:\n\n- Separate top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.\n- Method definitions inside a class are separated by a single blank line.\n- Extra blank lines may be used (sparingly) to separate groups of related functions. Blank lines may be omitted between a bunch of related one-liners.\n- Use blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical sections.\n\nHowever, it does not specifically mention the detail about the blank line after a function definition or a docstring."

        "content": "PEP 8, the style guide for Python code, doesn't explicitly require a blank line immediately after a function definition or a docstring within a function. The focus of PEP 8 is more on readability and consistency rather than enforcing strict rules about blank lines after every function definition or docstring.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the examples you provided:\n\n1. **Function Definition Without a Blank Line:**\n\n   ```python\n   def hello_function():\n       return 'hello'\n   ```\n\n   This is perfectly acceptable and in line with PEP 8. There is no requirement for a blank line after the function definition.\n\n2. **Function Definition With a Blank Line:**\n\n   ```python\n   def hello_function():\n\n       return 'hello'\n   ```\n\n   This is also acceptable, though the extra blank line might be seen as unnecessary unless it serves a purpose for readability or logical separation.\n\n3. **Docstring Without a Blank Line:**\n\n   ```python\n   def hello_function():\n       \"\"\"\n       Important function\n       \"\"\"\n       return 'hello'\n   ```\n\n   This is the typical style and adheres to PEP 8. The docstring is directly followed by the first line of code.\n\n4. **Docstring With a Blank Line:**\n\n   ```python\n   def hello_function():\n       \"\"\"\n       Important function\n       \"\"\"\n\n       return 'hello'\n   ```\n\n   While this isn't against any specific rule in PEP 8, the additional blank line is generally unnecessary unless it helps with readability.\n\nOverall, the choice between adding or omitting a blank line after a function definition or docstring comes down to personal preference or project-specific style guidelines. Consistency within your codebase is key. If you are contributing to a project, it's a good idea to follow the existing style of that project."
