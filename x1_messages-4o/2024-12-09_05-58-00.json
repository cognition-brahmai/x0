In the book by Beazley, there is a specific mention of this:\n\n```python\n>>>python.__closure__\n(<cell at 0x67f50: str object at 0x69230>,)\n>>>python.__closure__[0].cell_contents\n```\n\nFrom what I understand, '__closure__' is a list, but I am not clear about the cell contents and the string object that it shows. Also, is it a 1-ary tuple?"

        "content": "In Python, `obj.__closure__` is an attribute that is associated with function objects. It is used to access the closure of a function. A closure in Python is a function object that has access to variables in its lexical scope, even when the function is executed outside that scope.\n\nWhen a function is defined inside another function and references variables from the enclosing function, Python creates a closure. The `__closure__` attribute is a tuple of `cell` objects containing the bindings for these free variables. Each `cell` object has an attribute `cell_contents`, which holds the actual value of the variable.\n\nLet's break down the example you provided:\n\n```python\n>>> python.__closure__\n(<cell at 0x67f50: str object at 0x69230>,)\n```\n\n- `python.__closure__` is a tuple containing one `cell` object. This is why it's a 1-ary tuple (a tuple with one element).\n- Each `cell` in the tuple represents a closed-over variable.\n- The `cell` object shows memory addresses (e.g., `0x67f50` and `0x69230`) which are implementation details indicating where the cell and the object it contains are stored in memory.\n- `str object` indicates that the cell contains a string object.\n\n```python\n>>> python.__closure__[0].cell_contents\n```\n\n- This accesses the first cell in the tuple and retrieves the `cell_contents`, which is the actual value of the closed-over variable.\n\nIn summary, `__closure__` provides access to the closed-over variables of a function, which are stored as `cell` objects, and you can inspect these cells to see the values captured by the closure."
