        "content": "Yes, you can compile your main Python program into an executable using Cython, although it's a bit different from compiling modules to `.so` files. Instead of creating a shared library, you'll create an executable by linking against the Python interpreter. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Create a Cython file for your main program:** If your main program is `main.py`, rename it to `main.pyx`.\n\n2. **Modify your `setup.py` to create an executable:** You'll need to specify the `script_args` to build an executable instead of a shared library. Here's an example modification to your `setup.py`:\n\n    ```python\n    from distutils.core import setup\n    from distutils.extension import Extension\n    from Cython.Distutils import build_ext\n    import sys\n\n    ext_modules = [\n        Extension(\"ldap\", [\"ldap.pyx\"]),\n        Extension(\"checker\", [\"checker.pyx\"]),\n        Extension(\"finder\", [\"finder.pyx\"]),\n        Extension(\"utils\", [\"utils.pyx\"]),\n    ]\n\n    # Add your main program as an extension\n    ext_modules.append(\n        Extension(\"main\", [\"main.pyx\"])\n    )\n\n    setup(\n        name='bchecker',\n        cmdclass={'build_ext': build_ext},\n        ext_modules=ext_modules,\n        script_args=[\"build_ext\", \"--inplace\"]\n    )\n    ```\n\n3. **Compile your main program:** Run the setup script to compile your extensions and the main program. You can run the following command:\n\n    ```bash\n    python setup.py build_ext --inplace\n    ```\n\n4. **Link the main program to create an executable:** The above command will create a shared object file for your `main.pyx`. You can then create an executable by linking it with the Python interpreter. Here\u2019s an example of how you might do it manually using `gcc`:\n\n    ```bash\n    gcc -o main_executable main.c -I/usr/include/python2.6 -lpython2.6 -lpthread -lm -lutil -ldl\n    ```\n\n    Make sure to adjust the paths and libraries as per your system configuration.\n\n5. **Run your executable:** Once compiled, you can run your executable using:\n\n    ```bash\n    ./main_executable\n    ```\n\nNote: This is a more manual process and may require adjustments depending on your specific environment and dependencies. Also, ensure that you have the necessary development packages for Python installed on your system (e.g., `python2.6-dev`).\n\nKeep in mind that Cython is not primarily designed to create standalone executables, and this method involves some manual steps. For creating standalone executables more conveniently, you might also consider other tools like `PyInstaller` or `cx_Freeze`, which are designed for packaging Python applications into standalone executables."
