However, my attempts so far have either resulted in errors saying the vectors are not aligned, or returned a single value. How should I correctly perform this operation to get the output product matrix I want?"

        "content": "To multiply two vectors in NumPy and obtain a matrix, you should use the outer product. Given your vectors, vector A (4x1) and vector B (1x5), you can achieve this by using NumPy's `np.outer` or by simply using the `@` operator (matrix multiplication) after ensuring the shapes are appropriate.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define your vectors\nA = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4]])  # 4x1 vector\nB = np.array([[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]])    # 1x5 vector\n\n# Method 1: Using np.outer\nresult = np.outer(A, B)\n\n# Method 2: Reshaping and using matrix multiplication\nresult = A @ B\n\nprint(\"Resulting matrix:\\n\", result)\n```\n\nIn both methods, you will get a 4x5 matrix as a result. The `np.outer` function computes the outer product of two vectors, resulting in a matrix, while `A @ B` performs matrix multiplication directly, provided the shapes are compatible for this operation. In your case, vector A is treated as a column vector (4x1) and vector B as a row vector (1x5), making them perfectly aligned for matrix multiplication to yield a 4x5 matrix."
