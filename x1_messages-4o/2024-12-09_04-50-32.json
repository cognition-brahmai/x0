I have a file named `main.py` with certain code and another file named `stuff.py` in a subdirectory `utils`. When I run `main.py` from the command line, it gives the expected output. But when I run `pylint main.py`, it throws a `No name in module` error pointing to `utils.stuff`. Why is this happening and how can I make Pylint aware of `utils/stuff.py`? I am using Python 3.5.2, Pylint 1.6.4 and OS X 10.11.6. \n\nThe `main.py` code is:\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nimport utils.stuff\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(\"hi from main.py\")\n    utils.stuff.foo()\n```\n\nThe `stuff.py` code is:\n```python\nprint(\"hi from stuff.py\")\n\ndef foo():\n    print(\"foo\")\n```\n\nThe output from command line is:\n```\nhi from stuff.py\nhi from main.py\nfoo\n```\n\nThe output from Pylint is:\n```\nNo config file found, using default configuration\n************* Module main\nC:  1, 0: Missing module docstring (missing-docstring)\nE:  3, 0: No name 'stuff' in module 'utils' (no-name-in-module)\nE:  3, 0: Unable to import 'utils.stuff' (import-error)\nE:  7, 4: Module 'utils' has no 'stuff' member (no-member)\n```"

        "content": "The \"No name in module\" and \"Unable to import\" errors from Pylint typically occur when Pylint is not able to resolve the import paths correctly. This can happen for a variety of reasons, especially with relative imports and directory structures. Here's how you can address this issue:\n\n### Steps to Resolve the Error:\n\n1. **Check the Directory Structure:**  \n   Ensure that your directory structure is as follows:\n   ```\n   your_project_directory/\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.py\n   \u2514\u2500\u2500 utils/\n       \u2514\u2500\u2500 stuff.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Add an `__init__.py` File:**  \n   Python 3.5.2 still requires `__init__.py` files in directories to treat them as packages. Create an empty `__init__.py` file inside the `utils` directory:\n   ```\n   utils/\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n   \u2514\u2500\u2500 stuff.py\n   ```\n\n3. **Adjust the Python Path for Pylint:**  \n   When running Pylint, ensure that the Python path is set correctly. You can do this by setting the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to your project directory:\n   ```bash\n   PYTHONPATH=. pylint main.py\n   ```\n\n4. **Check Pylint Configuration:**  \n   If you have a `.pylintrc` file or a custom Pylint configuration, ensure that it doesn't have incorrect paths or settings that could be causing the issue.\n\n5. **Use Virtual Environments:**  \n   If you're not already using a virtual environment, consider setting one up. This can help ensure that your dependencies and paths are managed correctly.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`__init__.py` File:** By adding an `__init__.py` file, you indicate to Python that the directory should be treated as a package. This helps both Python and Pylint recognize `utils` as a package with the `stuff` module.\n\n- **PYTHONPATH:** Setting the `PYTHONPATH` ensures that Pylint is able to locate your modules correctly. This is particularly useful when running Pylint outside of your main project directory.\n\nBy following these steps, Pylint should be able to resolve the import paths correctly, and the errors should be eliminated."
