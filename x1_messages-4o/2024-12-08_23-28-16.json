        "content": "To perform sentiment analysis on the given movie review using Python and the NLTK library, you can follow these steps: preprocess the text data, use a machine learning model, and evaluate its accuracy. Below is a sample implementation:\n\n1. **Preprocessing the Text Data**: Tokenize the text, remove stopwords, and perform stemming or lemmatization.\n2. **Feature Extraction**: Convert text data into numerical features using techniques like Bag of Words or TF-IDF.\n3. **Model Training**: Use a classifier like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.\n4. **Evaluation**: Use cross-validation to evaluate model accuracy.\n\nHere's a simple implementation using NLTK and Scikit-learn:\n\n```python\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nfrom nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Sample data\nreviews = [\"This movie was very difficult to watch.\"]\nlabels = [\"negative\"]  # Assuming the sentiment is negative for demonstration\n\n# Preprocessing\nnltk.download('punkt')\nnltk.download('stopwords')\nnltk.download('wordnet')\n\nstop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\nlemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()\n\ndef preprocess_text(text):\n    # Tokenize\n    words = word_tokenize(text)\n    # Remove stopwords and lemmatize\n    words = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word.lower()) for word in words if word.isalpha() and word not in stop_words]\n    return ' '.join(words)\n\nprocessed_reviews = [preprocess_text(review) for review in reviews]\n\n# Feature Extraction\nvectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\n\n# Model and pipeline\nmodel = make_pipeline(vectorizer, MultinomialNB())\n\n# Cross-validation\n# Normally, you'd have a larger dataset with corresponding labels\n# Here we use the same single review multiple times for demonstration\nX = np.array(processed_reviews * 10)  # Artificially increasing the dataset size\ny = np.array(labels * 10)\n\n# Evaluate model with cross-validation\nscores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)\n\nprint(\"Cross-validation scores:\", scores)\nprint(\"Average accuracy:\", scores.mean())\n\n# Train and predict\nmodel.fit(X, y)\nprediction = model.predict(processed_reviews)\nprint(\"Predicted sentiment:\", prediction[0])\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- **Preprocessing**: The review is tokenized, stopwords are removed, and words are lemmatized.\n- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF vectorization is used to convert text to numerical features.\n- **Model**: A Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is used here due to its effectiveness with text data.\n- **Cross-validation**: The model is evaluated using cross-validation, but with a larger dataset, you would obtain more reliable results.\n\nFor a real-world application, you would need a larger dataset with labeled examples to train your model. The sentiment label for the review is assumed here for demonstration purposes."
