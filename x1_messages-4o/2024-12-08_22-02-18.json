        "content": "The average size of a baby oak tree, also known as a seedling or sapling, can vary depending on the species of oak and the growing conditions. Generally, when an oak tree first sprouts, it may be just a few inches tall. As a seedling, it typically ranges from about 6 inches to 2 feet tall within the first year or two of growth. As the tree continues to grow and develop into a sapling over several years, it can reach heights of 5 to 10 feet, again depending on the specific type of oak and environmental factors such as soil quality, sunlight, and water availability."
