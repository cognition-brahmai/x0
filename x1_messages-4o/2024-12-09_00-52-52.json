Here is the code, where 'x' is a dataframe, 'x['user']' is the x-axis and 'x['number']' is the y-axis:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline  \nplt.bar(x['user'], x['number'], color=\"blue\")\nplt.figure(figsize=(20,10)) \n```\nThe issue is that the line with the plt.figure function doesn't seem to be changing the initial dimensions of the plot. What could be the correct way to achieve this?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the order of your commands. In your current code, you're creating the bar plot before setting the figure size, which is why the size isn't being applied to the plot. \n\nTo set the figure size correctly, you need to specify the figure size before creating the plot. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Set the figure size before creating the plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(20, 10))\n\n# Now create the bar plot\nplt.bar(x['user'], x['number'], color=\"blue\")\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nBy calling `plt.figure(figsize=(20, 10))` before `plt.bar(...)`, you're ensuring that the figure size is set correctly for the plot you're about to create. Additionally, don't forget to call `plt.show()` at the end to display the plot when you're not using an interactive environment like Jupyter Notebook."
