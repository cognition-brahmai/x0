The lengths of the lists are not fixed and likely to be different. I would like to put the values of the first list in the pink column and the values of the second list in the green column, as shown in the linked image. I am using Windows 7, but may not have Office installed on the computers running this program. I have attempted to solve this using the xlwt module, but I would like to format the cells created in the for loop (containing the list1 values) as scientific or number. I do not want to truncate the values, as the actual values in the program could have around 10 digits after the decimal point."

        "content": "To write data from your Python program to an Excel spreadsheet and format the cells, you can use the `openpyxl` library. This library allows you to create Excel files without requiring Microsoft Office to be installed on your computer. It also provides capabilities for customizing cell formatting.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to accomplish your task:\n\n1. **Install `openpyxl`:** If you haven't already, you can install it using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install openpyxl\n   ```\n\n2. **Write to Excel:**\n\n   Below is a sample Python script that writes two lists of floating-point numbers and three string variables to an Excel spreadsheet, with specified formatting:\n\n   ```python\n   from openpyxl import Workbook\n   from openpyxl.styles import PatternFill, NamedStyle\n\n   # Sample data\n   list1 = [123.4567890123, 456.7890123456, 789.0123456789]  # First list of floating-point numbers\n   list2 = [987.6543210987, 654.3210987654]  # Second list of floating-point numbers\n   string1 = \"Example String 1\"\n   string2 = \"Example String 2\"\n   string3 = \"Example String 3\"\n\n   # Create a workbook and select the active worksheet\n   wb = Workbook()\n   ws = wb.active\n\n   # Set custom styles for number formatting\n   scientific_style = NamedStyle(name=\"scientific_style\", number_format='0.0000000000E+00')\n   wb.add_named_style(scientific_style)\n\n   # Set custom color fills\n   pink_fill = PatternFill(start_color=\"FFCCE5\", end_color=\"FFCCE5\", fill_type=\"solid\")\n   green_fill = PatternFill(start_color=\"CCFFCC\", end_color=\"CCFFCC\", fill_type=\"solid\")\n\n   # Write string variables\n   ws['A1'] = string1\n   ws['A2'] = string2\n   ws['A3'] = string3\n\n   # Write list1 to the pink column\n   for row_index, value in enumerate(list1, start=1):\n       cell = ws.cell(row=row_index, column=2, value=value)\n       cell.fill = pink_fill\n       cell.style = scientific_style\n\n   # Write list2 to the green column\n   for row_index, value in enumerate(list2, start=1):\n       cell = ws.cell(row=row_index, column=3, value=value)\n       cell.fill = green_fill\n       cell.style = scientific_style\n\n   # Save the workbook\n   wb.save(\"output.xlsx\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Explanation:**\n\n   - **Styles and Filling:** We define a `scientific_style` using `NamedStyle` to ensure numbers are formatted in scientific notation with up to 10 decimal places. We use `PatternFill` for coloring cells, with pink and green fills specified in hexadecimal color codes.\n   \n   - **Writing Data:** We write the string variables to specific cells and then iterate over the lists to write their contents to the specified columns, applying the fill colors and number formatting styles.\n\n4. **Running the Code:** Execute the script on your machine with Python installed. It will create an `output.xlsx` file in the same directory, which you can open with any application capable of reading Excel files (e.g., LibreOffice, Google Sheets).\n\nThis solution should work on Windows 7, and you don't need Microsoft Office installed to create the Excel file."
