For example, if I am catching multiple exceptions or all exceptions, I want to print the name of the exception in an error message. Here is a sample code on that:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    foo = bar\nexcept Exception as exception:\n    name_of_exception = ???\n    assert name_of_exception == 'NameError'\n    print \"Failed with exception [%s]\" % name_of_exception\n```\n\nIn this code, how can I derive the name of the exception to assign it to the `name_of_exception` variable?"

Here's how you can modify your code to achieve that:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    foo = bar\nexcept Exception as exception:\n    name_of_exception = exception.__class__.__name__\n    assert name_of_exception == 'NameError'\n    print(\"Failed with exception [%s]\" % name_of_exception)\n```\n\nIn this code, `exception.__class__.__name__` gives you the name of the exception's class, which is the name of the exception itself. So when a `NameError` is raised, `name_of_exception` will be `'NameError'`."
