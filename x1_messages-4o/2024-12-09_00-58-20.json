        "content": "In Python, you can obtain the string representation of an exception by using the `str()` function or simply converting the exception to a string. However, it looks like you're using an older syntax for the exception handling in your code. In Python 3, the syntax for catching exceptions has changed. You should use the `as` keyword to assign the exception to a variable. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    some_method()\nexcept Exception as e:\n    exception_string = str(e)\n    print(\"An exception occurred:\", exception_string)\n```\n\nIn this updated code, `str(e)` will give you the string representation of the exception, which you can then print or use as needed. This syntax is compatible with Python 3."
