        "content": "To create a list of four distinct adjectives describing happiness using the `random` module in Python, you can follow the approach below. We'll define a list of adjectives and then randomly select four distinct adjectives from it.\n\nHere's a revised version of the code:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# List of adjectives describing happiness\nadjectives = [\"joyful\", \"cheerful\", \"content\", \"elated\", \"blissful\", \"gleeful\", \"jovial\", \"merry\", \"radiant\", \"ecstatic\"]\n\n# Randomly select four distinct adjectives\nselected_adjectives = random.sample(adjectives, 4)\n\n# Display the selected adjectives\nprint(selected_adjectives)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We define a list of adjectives that describe happiness.\n- We use `random.sample()` to select four distinct adjectives from the list. The `random.sample()` function ensures that the selected elements are unique.\n- Finally, we print the list of selected adjectives.\n\nBy using `random.sample()`, you ensure that the same adjective is not selected more than once, thus achieving the goal of distinct adjectives."
