        "content": "In Python, organizing classes across multiple files is more flexible than in Java, but there are still some best practices you can follow to maintain clean and manageable code. Here are some guidelines:\n\n1. **Module and Package Structure**:\n   - **Modules**: A Python file (`.py`) is considered a module. You can have multiple classes in a single module, but it's often a good practice to group related classes together.\n   - **Packages**: A directory containing an `__init__.py` file is considered a package. Use packages to group related modules together.\n\n2. **Logical Grouping**:\n   - Group classes that are logically related in the same module. For example, if you have classes that represent different shapes, you might put them all in a `shapes.py` module.\n\n3. **File Naming**:\n   - Use descriptive file names that indicate the purpose of the module. For example, `user.py` for user-related classes or `database.py` for database-related classes.\n\n4. **Avoid Overcrowding**:\n   - While Python allows multiple classes per file, avoid overcrowding a single file with too many unrelated classes. This can make the file difficult to navigate.\n\n5. **Consistent Import Style**:\n   - Use explicit relative imports within a package to make dependencies clear. This is particularly helpful when refactoring.\n\n6. **Refactoring**:\n   - As the project grows, consider refactoring large modules into sub-packages to keep the codebase organized. For example, if `shapes.py` becomes too large, you can create a `shapes/` directory with separate modules for each shape type.\n\n7. **Namespace Management**:\n   - Use `__all__` in your module\u2019s `__init__.py` files to control what gets imported with a wildcard import.\n\n8. **Documentation**:\n   - Document your modules and classes with docstrings. This is crucial for maintaining readability and understanding the purpose of each part of your codebase.\n\n9. **Testing**:\n   - Keep your test cases in a separate directory, typically named `tests/`, and ensure that each module has corresponding tests.\n\n10. **Project Structure Example**:\n    ```\n    my_project/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 my_package/\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 module1.py\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 module2.py\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 subpackage/\n    \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n    \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 submodule1.py\n    \u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 submodule2.py\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 tests/\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 test_module1.py\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 test_module2.py\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 test_submodule1.py\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 test_submodule2.py\n    ```\n\nFollowing these practices will help you maintain a clean and scalable Python project structure."
