Is it possible?"

        "content": "To specify a private SSH key when executing a Git command, you can use the `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` environment variable, which allows you to customize the SSH command used by Git. This is useful for specifying a different SSH key. Here's how you can do it in a shell command:\n\n```bash\nGIT_SSH_COMMAND='ssh -i /home/christoffer/ssh_keys/theuser' git clone git@github.com:TheUser/TheProject.git\n```\n\nThis command sets the `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` to use the `ssh` command with the `-i` option, specifying the path to your private key. The scope of this environment variable is limited to the command it's prefixed to, making it an efficient way to temporarily specify a different SSH key.\n\nFor Ruby, you can achieve similar functionality by setting the environment variable within your script before executing the shell command. Here's a Ruby example:\n\n```ruby\ndef with_key(key_path)\n  original_git_ssh_command = ENV['GIT_SSH_COMMAND']\n  ENV['GIT_SSH_COMMAND'] = \"ssh -i #{key_path}\"\n  yield\nensure\n  ENV['GIT_SSH_COMMAND'] = original_git_ssh_command\nend\n\nwith_key(\"/home/christoffer/ssh_keys/theuser\") do\n  system(\"git clone git@github.com:TheUser/TheProject.git\")\nend\n```\n\nIn this Ruby example, the `with_key` method sets the `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` environment variable to use the specified SSH key, executes the block of code provided, and then restores the original environment variable. The `system` call is used to execute the `git clone` command.\n\nThis approach provides a neat way to specify a private SSH key for Git operations programmatically within a Ruby script."
