        "content": "To calculate the Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) for text classification, you'll need to follow these steps to classify tweets into categories using your annotated dataset and category-specific dictionaries:\n\n### Step 1: Understand PMI\nPMI measures the association between a word and a category. It compares the probability of a word appearing in a category to the probability of it appearing in the dataset in general. The formula for PMI is:\n\n\\[ \\text{PMI}(w, c) = \\log \\frac{P(w, c)}{P(w) \\times P(c)} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( P(w, c) \\) is the joint probability of word \\( w \\) and category \\( c \\).\n- \\( P(w) \\) is the probability of word \\( w \\).\n- \\( P(c) \\) is the probability of category \\( c \\).\n\n### Step 2: Estimate Probabilities\nTo compute PMI, you need to estimate the probabilities:\n\n1. **Joint Probability \\( P(w, c) \\):** \n   - Count the number of times word \\( w \\) appears in tweets annotated with category \\( c \\).\n   - Divide by the total number of tweets.\n\n2. **Probability of Word \\( P(w) \\):**\n   - Count the total occurrences of word \\( w \\) in the entire dataset.\n   - Divide by the total number of tweets.\n\n3. **Probability of Category \\( P(c) \\):**\n   - Count the total number of tweets labeled with category \\( c \\).\n   - Divide by the total number of tweets.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate PMI for Each Word-Category Pair\nFor each word in your dictionary, calculate its PMI with respect to each category using the formula above. \n\n### Step 4: Classify Tweets\nTo classify a tweet, compute the PMI score for each category by summing up the PMI values of all words in the tweet that appear in the category's dictionary:\n\n\\[ \\text{Score}(t, c) = \\sum_{w \\in t} \\text{PMI}(w, c) \\]\n\nWhere \\( t \\) is the tweet and \\( c \\) is the category.\n\n### Step 5: Assign Category\nAssign the tweet to the category with the highest PMI score.\n\n### Example\nSuppose you have a tweet \"I love sunny days\" and two categories: \"Positive\" and \"Weather\". You have a dictionary for each category with relevant words.\n\n1. **Calculate PMI for each word-category pair** based on your dataset.\n2. **Compute the score** for each category by summing the PMI scores of the words in the tweet:\n   - \\( \\text{Score}_{\\text{Positive}} = \\text{PMI}(\\text{I}, \\text{Positive}) + \\text{PMI}(\\text{love}, \\text{Positive}) + \\ldots \\)\n   - \\( \\text{Score}_{\\text{Weather}} = \\text{PMI}(\\text{I}, \\text{Weather}) + \\text{PMI}(\\text{sunny}, \\text{Weather}) + \\ldots \\)\n\n3. **Assign the tweet** to the category with the highest score.\n\n### Implementation\nThis process can be implemented using Python and libraries like `numpy` and `pandas` for data manipulation. Ensure you handle cases where probabilities might be zero using smoothing techniques.\n\nBy following these steps, you can use PMI to classify tweets into categories efficiently."
