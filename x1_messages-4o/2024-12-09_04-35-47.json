        "content": "The issue you're experiencing with your Makefile is likely due to the fact that the `.o` files are being rebuilt every time you run the `make` command, which in turn causes the final executable to be rebuilt.\n\nHere are a few reasons why this might be happening and how you can fix it:\n\n1. **Timestamp of Output Files**: Make uses the timestamps of files to decide whether a target needs to be rebuilt. It compares the timestamps of the source files (`.cpp`, `.cu`, `.h`) with the corresponding object files (`.o`). If any source file is newer than the corresponding object file, it considers the object file out-of-date. Make sure that the timestamps of your source files are not inadvertently being updated.\n\n2. **Dynamic Definitions**: In your rule for `$(BIN)main_cos.o`, you have:\n   ```make\n   -D$(shell echo $(MAKECMDGOALS) | tr a-z A-Z)\n   ```\n   This line dynamically adds a preprocessor definition based on the make target. This means that the command line for compiling `main_cos.o` changes every time you switch between `make future`, `make managed`, and `make stream`, leading to recompilation because the command differs. If you're not switching between different targets, this should not cause recompilation, but if you are, it will.\n\n   **Solution**: If you don't need this dynamic behavior, remove this part or ensure the target doesn't change. If you do need it, accept that recompilation is necessary when switching targets, or restructure your build logic.\n\n3. **Consistency Between Executables**: You have three targets\u2014`future`, `managed`, and `stream`\u2014which all depend on the same object files. If any of these is compiled with different flags or definitions, it will cause recompilation.\n\n4. **Target Dependencies**: Ensure that all source files and headers exist and have appropriate timestamps. If a header file is modified, it will trigger recompilation of any object file that depends on it.\n\nTo diagnose the exact cause, you can run `make` with the `--debug=b` option to see why each target is being considered out-of-date:\n\n```bash\nmake --debug=b future\n```\n\nThis will provide more insight into why `make` thinks each file needs to be rebuilt.\n\nIf none of this resolves the problem, check for any automatic file generation scripts that might be updating timestamps or any other external factors affecting file modification times."
