I can open each file using `f = open(...)`, read line by line using `f.readline()`, and write each line into a new file, but reading and writing line by line doesn't seem to be the most efficient or elegant solution. Is there a better way to achieve this in Python?"

        "content": "Certainly! Concatenating text files in Python can be done more elegantly by using context managers and built-in functions that handle files more efficiently. Here\u2019s a concise and efficient approach using the `with` statement and list comprehension:\n\n```python\nfile_names = ['file1.txt', 'file2.txt', ..., 'file20.txt']\noutput_file = 'concatenated.txt'\n\nwith open(output_file, 'w') as outfile:\n    for file_name in file_names:\n        with open(file_name, 'r') as infile:\n            outfile.write(infile.read())\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`with` Statement**: This is a context manager that ensures files are properly opened and closed. It automatically handles closing the file after the block of code is executed, which is more elegant and error-proof than manually opening and closing files.\n  \n- **Reading Entire File**: Using `infile.read()` reads the entire content of the file at once. This is generally efficient for small to moderately sized files. For very large files, you may want to read and write in chunks to avoid memory issues.\n\n- **Writing**: `outfile.write()` is used to write the contents of each file into the output file. This operation is straightforward and efficient when the entire file content is available as a string.\n\nThis approach minimizes the amount of code you write and leverages Python's built-in capabilities for file handling, making it both elegant and efficient."
