        "content": "Certainly! You can use a lambda function in combination with the `filter()` function to find all the numbers in a list that are divisible by 10. Here's a simple solution:\n\n```python\n# Sample list of numbers\nnumbers = [10, 23, 45, 50, 60, 78, 90, 100]\n\n# Use filter with a lambda function to find numbers divisible by 10\ndivisible_by_10 = list(filter(lambda x: x % 10 == 0, numbers))\n\n# Output the result\nprint(divisible_by_10)\n```\n\nIn this code, the lambda function `lambda x: x % 10 == 0` is used to check if a number `x` is divisible by 10. The `filter()` function applies this lambda function to each element in the `numbers` list and returns an iterator with the elements that satisfy the condition (i.e., elements that are divisible by 10). Finally, `list()` converts the iterator into a list."
