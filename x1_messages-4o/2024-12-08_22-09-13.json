Below is a list of symptoms that can indicate a variety of illnesses. Your task is to use your deductive skills to determine which illness is causing the symptoms:\n| Illness | Symptoms |\n|---------|----------|\n| Guillain-Barre Syndrome | muscle weakness, tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, difficulty breathing |\n| Myasthenia Gravis | muscle weakness, difficulty speaking or swallowing, drooping eyelids |\n| Multiple Sclerosis | numbness or tingling in the limbs, difficulty walking or maintaining balance, blurred vision |\nIn addition, here is a code snippet that may assist you in your deduction:\n```\nif (muscleWeakness && tinglingOrNumbness && difficultyBreathing) {\n  console.log(\"You may have Guillain-Barre Syndrome\");\n} else if (muscleWeakness && (difficultySpeakingOrSwallowing || droopingEyelids)) {\n  console.log(\"You may have Myasthenia Gravis\");\n} else if ((numbnessOrTingling || difficultyWalking) && blurredVision) {\n  console.log(\"You may have Multiple Sclerosis\");\n} else {\n  console.log(\"Your symptoms do not appear to match any of these illnesses\");\n}\n```"

        "content": "Based on the symptoms and the code snippet provided, let's break down the possible conditions:\n\n1. **Guillain-Barre Syndrome**: The key symptoms include muscle weakness, tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, and difficulty breathing. According to the code, if all three symptoms are present, it suggests Guillain-Barre Syndrome.\n\n2. **Myasthenia Gravis**: This condition is associated with muscle weakness, difficulty speaking or swallowing, and drooping eyelids. The code indicates that if there is muscle weakness along with either difficulty speaking/swallowing or drooping eyelids, it suggests Myasthenia Gravis.\n\n3. **Multiple Sclerosis**: This involves symptoms like numbness or tingling in the limbs, difficulty walking or maintaining balance, and blurred vision. The code suggests that if there is numbness/tingling or difficulty walking along with blurred vision, it points toward Multiple Sclerosis.\n\nTo determine which illness might be causing the symptoms in question, compare them with the conditions listed:\n\n- If all symptoms match those of Guillain-Barre Syndrome, it's likely the cause.\n- If the symptoms align with Myasthenia Gravis, particularly focusing on the key indicators, it could be the cause.\n- If the symptoms match those of Multiple Sclerosis, it could be the cause.\n\nIf none of the symptoms align clearly with one condition, it might indicate that the symptoms do not match any of these specific illnesses or that there might be another underlying condition. Always consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."
