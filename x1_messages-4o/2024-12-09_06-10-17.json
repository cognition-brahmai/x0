I am encountering an error stating \"commands out of sync; you can't run this command now\" when I try to execute a second statement. Right now, I am unable to commit the transaction. This problem arises only when I call a procedure. Could anyone help me understand and fix this issue? Here is my code:\n\nPython code:\n```python\ncursor.callproc('my_mysql_procedure', [some_id,]) \nresult = cursor.fetchall()\nfor r in result:\n    #do something\n\ncursor.execute(\"select * from some_table\")\nresult = cursor.fetchall()\n```\nMySQL procedure:\n```sql\ndelimiter $$\ncreate procedure my_mysql_procedure(p_page_id int)\n    begin\n        select 1\n        from dual; \n    end$$\ndelimiter ;\n```"

        "content": "The error \"commands out of sync; you can't run this command now\" typically occurs when the sequence of operations on a MySQL connection is not handled correctly, particularly when mixing stored procedure calls with other operations. The MySQL Python (MySQLdb/PyMySQL) library requires that all results from a stored procedure be fetched before any other query is executed on the same connection.\n\nHere are a few suggestions to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Fetch All Results from the Stored Procedure**:\n   Ensure that all results from the stored procedure call are fully fetched before executing any new query. You seem to be doing this with `cursor.fetchall()`, but ensure that it is complete and no results are left to be fetched.\n\n2. **Close the Cursor**:\n   After fetching the results, close the cursor to ensure that the connection is ready for the next query.\n\n3. **Reset Connection State**:\n   If you're using a connection pool, ensure that the connection state is reset or manually handled between procedure calls and regular queries.\n\n4. **Check for Multiple Result Sets**:\n   If your stored procedure is returning multiple result sets, you need to iterate over them using a loop until there are no more results. Use `cursor.nextset()` to access subsequent result sets.\n\nHere\u2019s an adjusted version of your Python code with these suggestions:\n\n```python\n# Call the stored procedure\ncursor.callproc('my_mysql_procedure', [some_id,])\n\n# Fetch all results from the procedure\nresult = cursor.fetchall()\nfor r in result:\n    # Do something with the result\n\n# Make sure to handle multiple result sets if necessary\nwhile cursor.nextset():\n    additional_results = cursor.fetchall()\n    for additional_result in additional_results:\n        # Process additional results\n\n# Execute the next query\ncursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM some_table\")\nresult = cursor.fetchall()\nfor row in result:\n    # Do something with the results\n\n# Close the cursor\ncursor.close()\n```\n\n5. **Use a Separate Connection for Each Task**:\n   If possible, use separate connections for executing stored procedures and other queries. This way, you isolate the operations and avoid the sync issue.\n\n6. **Upgrade MySQL Connector**:\n   Ensure that you are using the latest version of the MySQL connector for Python, as there may be bug fixes or improvements related to this issue.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the \"commands out of sync\" error and properly manage your database operations with stored procedures in Django and MySQL."
