How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "It looks like there is a mismatch between the location of the `pip` binary and where your shell is trying to execute it from. This might have happened due to the way the upgrade was performed. Follow these steps to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify Pip Installation:**\n   First, check the actual location of the `pip` executable:\n   ```bash\n   which pip\n   ```\n   You've already done this, and it shows `/usr/local/bin/pip`, which is correct.\n\n2. **Update the PATH:**\n   Ensure that `/usr/local/bin` is in your `PATH`. You can check your `PATH` by running:\n   ```bash\n   echo $PATH\n   ```\n   If `/usr/local/bin` is not in the `PATH`, you can add it by running:\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin\n   ```\n   Make this change permanent by adding the above line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile`.\n\n3. **Reinstall Pip:**\n   If the above steps don't resolve the issue, you might need to reinstall `pip`. You can do this by downloading the `get-pip.py` script and executing it:\n\n   ```bash\n   curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py\n   python get-pip.py\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for Aliases:**\n   Check if there is an alias set for `pip` that might be pointing to the wrong path:\n   ```bash\n   alias\n   ```\n   If you find an alias for `pip`, you can remove it with:\n   ```bash\n   unalias pip\n   ```\n\n5. **Symbolic Link:**\n   If there is a need to ensure `pip` is always accessible, you might consider creating a symbolic link:\n   ```bash\n   ln -s /usr/local/bin/pip /usr/bin/pip\n   ```\n\n6. **Verify Python Version:**\n   Make sure you are using the correct version of Python that matches the `pip` installation:\n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   ```\n\nAfter following these steps, try running `pip` again to see if the issue is resolved. If not, you may want to check for any specific configurations or Docker image issues that might be affecting the environment."
