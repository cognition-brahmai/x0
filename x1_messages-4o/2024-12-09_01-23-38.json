I am working with Python 2.7. I have a dictionary as follows:\n\n```python\nNL_East = {'Phillies': [645, 469], 'Braves': [599, 548], 'Mets': [653, 672]}\n```\n\nI would like to feed this dictionary into a function and iterate over each team. Currently, I am able to do this only for one team at a time. Here's the code I'm using:\n\n```python\ndef Pythag(league):\n    runs_scored = float(league['Phillies'][0])\n    runs_allowed = float(league['Phillies'][1])\n    win_percentage = round((runs_scored**2)/((runs_scored**2)+(runs_allowed**2))*1000)\n    print win_percentage\n```\n\nSo, how can I modify this function to iterate over each team and print the expected win_percentage for each one?"

        "content": "To iterate over each team in the `NL_East` dictionary and calculate the win percentage for each, you can modify your function to use a loop. In Python 2.7, you can use the `iteritems()` method to iterate over the key-value pairs in the dictionary. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef Pythag(league):\n    for team, scores in league.iteritems():  # Use iteritems() for Python 2.7\n        runs_scored = float(scores[0])\n        runs_allowed = float(scores[1])\n        win_percentage = round((runs_scored**2) / ((runs_scored**2) + (runs_allowed**2)) * 1000)\n        print(f\"{team}: {win_percentage}\")\n\nNL_East = {'Phillies': [645, 469], 'Braves': [599, 548], 'Mets': [653, 672]}\nPythag(NL_East)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the changes:\n\n1. **Use `iteritems()`:** In Python 2.7, `iteritems()` is used to get an iterator over the dictionary's key-value pairs. This is similar to `items()` in Python 3.x.\n\n2. **Loop through the dictionary:** Use a `for` loop to iterate over each team name (`team`) and their corresponding list of runs (`scores`).\n\n3. **Calculate win percentage:** Inside the loop, calculate the win percentage for each team using the runs scored and allowed.\n\n4. **Print the result:** Use `print` to display the team name along with its calculated win percentage.\n\nThis modified function will print the expected win percentage for each team in the given dictionary."
