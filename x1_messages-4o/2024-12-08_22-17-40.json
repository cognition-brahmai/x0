In addition to the header, body, and footer elements, you want to incorporate a sidebar with additional links and categories. The header should have a logo image on the left and a navigation menu on the right with five links: \"Home\", \"About\", \"Contact\", \"Services\", and \"Blog\". The body should have three sections: a \"Featured\" section, a \"Latest News\" section, and a \"Popular Posts\" section. The \"Featured\" section should have a title, an image, a description, and a button to read more. The \"Latest News\" section should have a title and a list of five news articles with titles, dates, and a button to read more. The \"Popular Posts\" section should have a title and a list of five blog posts with titles, authors, dates, and a button to read more. The sidebar should have a search bar, a list of categories, a list of tags, and a section for social media links.
