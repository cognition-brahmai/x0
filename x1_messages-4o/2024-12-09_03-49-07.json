My current code is working fine to download files, but when a folder is present inside the bucket, it is throwing an IOError.

        "content": "To download all files, including those within folders, from an S3 bucket using Boto3, you'll need to create the necessary local directories before attempting to download the files into them. The error you're encountering is due to trying to download a file into a directory that doesn't exist locally.\n\nHere's how you can modify your script to handle directories:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport boto3\n\ns3 = boto3.client('s3')\n\nbucket_name = 'my_bucket_name'\nresponse = s3.list_objects_v2(Bucket=bucket_name)\n\n# Ensure the 'Contents' key is present in the response which contains the objects\nif 'Contents' in response:\n    for obj in response['Contents']:\n        key = obj['Key']\n        # Create local directory structure if needed\n        if '/' in key:\n            os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(key), exist_ok=True)\n        # Download the file\n        s3.download_file(bucket_name, key, key)\nelse:\n    print(\"The bucket is empty or does not exist.\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Directory Creation**: Before downloading each file, the code checks if there are any directories in the key (i.e., if '/' is present). It then uses `os.makedirs()` to create the required directory structure. The `exist_ok=True` parameter ensures that no error is thrown if the directory already exists.\n\n2. **List Objects**: Ensure that you're using `list_objects_v2` as it is the recommended way to list objects in an S3 bucket. It also can handle pagination better if there are many objects.\n\n3. **Key Handling**: The `key` variable holds the full path of the object in the bucket. This path is used both for creating the directory and downloading the file.\n\nThis script will correctly handle downloading all files from the bucket, including those located within folders."
