Here's the code I'm using to set the xticks and rotate the labels:\n\n```python\nax.set_xticks(xlabels_positions)\nax.set_xticklabels(xlabels, rotation=45)\n```\n\nHowever, the rotation is centered on the middle of the text labels, making them appear shifted to the right. I attempted to use the following code:\n\n```python\nax.set_xticklabels(xlabels, rotation=45, rotation_mode=\"anchor\")\n```\n\nBut it didn't yield the desired result. It seems \"anchor\" is the only value allowed for the \"rotation_mode\" parameter. How can I move the labels a bit to the left so that they align with their respective ticks?"

        "content": "To align rotated xticklabels with their respective xticks in Matplotlib, you can adjust the horizontal alignment of the text labels. By default, when you rotate labels, they tend to be centered, which can cause them to appear misaligned with their ticks.\n\nTo fix this, you can set the horizontal alignment to 'right' or 'left', depending on your rotation angle and preference. You can achieve this by using `set_ha()` on each label in a loop, or by using the `ha` parameter directly in the `set_xticklabels()` method if you are customizing the tick labels. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Assuming `ax` is your Axes object\nax.set_xticks(xlabels_positions)\nax.set_xticklabels(xlabels, rotation=45, ha='right')  # Set horizontal alignment to 'right'\n```\n\nIf you want more control over the text alignment, especially for fine-tuning, you can iterate over the text objects returned by `ax.get_xticklabels()` and set their properties individually:\n\n```python\nax.set_xticks(xlabels_positions)\nax.set_xticklabels(xlabels, rotation=45)\n\nfor label in ax.get_xticklabels():\n    label.set_ha('right')  # Set horizontal alignment to 'right'\n```\n\nAdjusting the horizontal alignment should help in aligning the labels with their respective ticks. You can experiment with 'left', 'center', or 'right' for different visual results depending on your specific needs."
