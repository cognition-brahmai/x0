        "content": "How can I create a Python function that zips the contents of a source directory (src) to a zip file (dst)? I want the function to zip the individual files and subdirectories within the source directory, not the directory itself. For example, the function should look something like this: `zip('/path/to/dir', '/path/to/file.zip')`. However, my current attempt is causing a problem where the zip file contains the directory structure itself. Here is my current code:\n\n```python\ndef zip(src, dst):\n    zf = zipfile.ZipFile(\"%s.zip\" % (dst), \"w\")\n    for dirname, subdirs, files in os.walk(src):\n        zf.write(dirname)\n        for filename in files:\n            zf.write(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n    zf.close()\n```\nThis creates a zip that is essentially `/`. For example, if I zipped `/path/to/dir`, extracting the zip creates a directory with \"path\" in it, with \"to\" in that directory, etc. Is there a function that doesn't cause this problem?"

        "content": "To ensure that the contents of the source directory are zipped without including the directory structure itself, you need to modify the code so that the paths within the zip file are relative to the source directory. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport zipfile\n\ndef zip(src, dst):\n    zf = zipfile.ZipFile(dst, \"w\", zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED)\n    for dirname, subdirs, files in os.walk(src):\n        # Calculate the relative path for the directory\n        rel_dir = os.path.relpath(dirname, src)\n        # Add the directory to the zip file if it's not the root directory\n        if rel_dir != \".\":\n            zf.write(dirname, rel_dir)\n        for filename in files:\n            # Calculate the relative path for the file\n            rel_file = os.path.relpath(os.path.join(dirname, filename), src)\n            # Add the file to the zip file using its relative path\n            zf.write(os.path.join(dirname, filename), rel_file)\n    zf.close()\n\n# Usage example:\n# zip('/path/to/dir', '/path/to/file.zip')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`os.path.relpath`**: This function is used to compute the relative file path from the source directory. It ensures that the directory structure in the zip file starts from the root of the source directory, rather than including the entire path.\n- **Writing Directories**: The code checks if `rel_dir` is not `\".\"` (which represents the source directory itself) before adding directories to the zip file.\n- **`zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED`**: This specifies the compression method to be used. It compresses the files in the zip archive.\n\nBy using relative paths, the function ensures that the contents of the source directory are zipped correctly without unnecessary directory structures."
