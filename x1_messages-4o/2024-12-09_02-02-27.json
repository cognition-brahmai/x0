        "content": "To break a long line containing a ternary operator in Python to adhere to the 79-character limit, you can use parentheses for better readability and line continuation. This approach is often used to make code more readable and maintain the PEP 8 guidelines. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nanswer = (\n    'Ten for that? You must be mad!'\n    if does_not_haggle(brian)\n    else \"It's worth ten if it's worth a shekel.\"\n)\n```\n\nBy enclosing the expression in parentheses, you can split the line at logical points without breaking the code. This makes it clear and easy to read while adhering to the 79-character limit."
