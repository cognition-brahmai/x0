        "content": "The error message you're encountering, `IntegrityError at /accounts/signup/ NOT NULL constraint failed: accounts_myprofile.zipcode`, indicates that there is a database integrity issue specifically related to the `zipcode` field in your `accounts_myprofile` table. This error is not directly related to Userena but rather to how your database schema is currently defined.\n\nHere's what's happening:\n\n1. **NOT NULL Constraint**: This constraint in your database schema means that the `zipcode` field cannot have a NULL value. Every record must have a value for `zipcode`.\n\n2. **Error Cause**: When you added `zipcode = models.IntegerField(_('zipcode'), max_length=5)`, you did not provide a default value or allow it to be nullable. As a result, when a new record is being inserted into the database (like during signup), and the form does not provide a `zipcode`, the database throws an error because it's trying to insert a NULL value into a field that cannot be NULL.\n\n3. **Solution**: Here are a few ways to resolve this issue:\n\n   - **Provide a Default Value**: Modify the field to provide a default value. This is useful if a missing `zipcode` is acceptable and you have a default that makes sense.\n\n     ```python\n     zipcode = models.IntegerField(_('zipcode'), max_length=5, default=0)\n     ```\n\n   - **Make it Nullable**: Allow the field to be NULL if it's not a mandatory field.\n\n     ```python\n     zipcode = models.IntegerField(_('zipcode'), max_length=5, null=True, blank=True)\n     ```\n\n   - **Ensure Form Input**: Make sure that your signup form requires a `zipcode` and that it is being submitted correctly. You might need to update your form validation logic to ensure that this field is always provided.\n\n4. **Database Migration**: After making changes to your model, remember to create and apply a migration to update the database schema:\n\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py makemigrations\n   python manage.py migrate\n   ```\n\nBy addressing the NOT NULL constraint violation through one of the above methods, you should be able to resolve the error you're encountering."
