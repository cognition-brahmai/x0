        "content": "How can I make a command line interface (CLI) utility using Click where one command (`cmd3`) inherits the same options and flags as two other commands (`cmd1` and `cmd2`)? For example, `cmd3` should have the `--verbose` flag from `cmd1` and the `--directory` option from `cmd2`. I have tried using `click.group()`, but it requires all the group's options to be specified before the group's command, and I would like to have all the options normally after the command. Is there a way to achieve this?\n\nHere's an example of the current code:\n\n```python\n@click.command()\n@click.options(\"--verbose\")\ndef cmd1():\n    pass\n\n@click.command()\n@click.options(\"--directory\")\ndef cmd2():\n    pass\n\n@click.command()\n@click.inherit(cmd1, cmd2) # HYPOTHETICAL\ndef cmd3():\n    pass\n```\n\nI would like to call the command as `cli.py cmd3 --verbose --directory /tmp` instead of `cli.py --verbose --directory /tmp cmd3`."

        "content": "To achieve the functionality where a command (`cmd3`) inherits options and flags from other commands (`cmd1` and `cmd2`) using Click, you can use decorators and some helper functions to manually add the desired options to `cmd3`. Click does not natively support inheriting options across commands in the way you described, but you can create a custom solution to replicate this behavior.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport click\n\n# Define the options separately so they can be reused\ndef verbose_option(f):\n    return click.option('--verbose', is_flag=True, help='Enable verbose mode.')(f)\n\ndef directory_option(f):\n    return click.option('--directory', type=click.Path(), help='Directory path.')(f)\n\n@click.command()\n@verbose_option\ndef cmd1(verbose):\n    if verbose:\n        click.echo(\"Verbose mode is on for cmd1\")\n\n@click.command()\n@directory_option\ndef cmd2(directory):\n    click.echo(f\"Directory is set to {directory} for cmd2\")\n\n@click.command()\n@verbose_option\n@directory_option\ndef cmd3(verbose, directory):\n    if verbose:\n        click.echo(\"Verbose mode is on for cmd3\")\n    click.echo(f\"Directory is set to {directory} for cmd3\")\n\n@click.group()\ndef cli():\n    pass\n\ncli.add_command(cmd1)\ncli.add_command(cmd2)\ncli.add_command(cmd3)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    cli()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Reusable Option Decorators**: Create functions (`verbose_option` and `directory_option`) that return the `click.option` decorator. This allows you to easily apply the same option to multiple commands.\n\n2. **Command Definitions**: Apply these option decorators to the relevant commands. `cmd3` gets both `@verbose_option` and `@directory_option`, thus inheriting options from both `cmd1` and `cmd2`.\n\n3. **Group and Command Registration**: Use a `click.group()` to register your commands. Add each command to the group using `cli.add_command()`.\n\nThis setup allows you to call your commands like `cli.py cmd3 --verbose --directory /tmp`, and each command can have its own logic while sharing options as needed."
