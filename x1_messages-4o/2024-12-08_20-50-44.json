        "content": "To solve the expression \\(12 - 4 \\times 3 \\div 6 + 8\\), we need to follow the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)).\n\n1. Start with the multiplication and division from left to right:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 3 = 12\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   12 \\div 6 = 2\n   \\]\n\n2. Now substitute back into the expression:\n   \\[\n   12 - 2 + 8\n   \\]\n\n3. Finally, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:\n   \\[\n   12 - 2 = 10\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   10 + 8 = 18\n   \\]\n\nSo, the result of the expression \\(12 - 4 \\times 3 \\div 6 + 8\\) is \\(18\\)."
