There are two ways to define custom transformations: one is by using `sklearn.preprocessing.FunctionTrasformer` and the other is by subclassing `sklearn.base.TransformerMixin`. Which method is the recommended approach and why?"

        "content": "Both `sklearn.preprocessing.FunctionTransformer` and subclassing `sklearn.base.TransformerMixin` are valid approaches for defining custom transformations in a pipeline, and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements and complexity of your transformation.\n\n1. **FunctionTransformer**:\n   - **Simplicity**: If your transformation can be expressed as a simple function, `FunctionTransformer` is a quick and straightforward way to incorporate it into a pipeline. It is especially useful for simple, stateless transformations that do not require fitting.\n   - **Less Boilerplate**: You do not need to write a class; you can directly pass a function to `FunctionTransformer`, making it more concise.\n\n2. **Subclassing TransformerMixin**:\n   - **Flexibility and Complexity**: If your transformation requires fitting (i.e., it needs to learn parameters from the data, like scaling or encoding), or if it involves more complex logic that cannot be easily captured in a single function, subclassing `TransformerMixin` is the recommended approach. This method allows you to define `fit`, `transform`, and optionally `fit_transform` methods, providing more control and flexibility.\n   - **Stateful Transformations**: If your transformation needs to maintain state (like learned parameters during fitting), subclassing `TransformerMixin` is necessary as it provides a structured way to implement the `fit` and `transform` methods.\n\nIn summary, for simple, stateless transformations, `FunctionTransformer` is suitable. For more complex, stateful transformations that require fitting, subclassing `TransformerMixin` is the better choice. The key is to consider the complexity of your transformation and whether it requires learning from data to decide the appropriate method."
