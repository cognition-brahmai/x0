        "content": "To accomplish this task, you need to follow several steps to generate a matrix of numbers that are products of exactly two distinct prime numbers, calculate the largest prime factor for each, and then compute their sum and average. Here is a MATLAB script that performs these operations:\n\n```matlab\nfunction avgLargestPrimeFactors = calculateAverageLargestPrimeFactors(n)\n    % This function calculates the average of the largest prime factors\n    % for numbers that are products of exactly two distinct prime numbers\n    % less than or equal to a given limit n.\n\n    % Initialize variables\n    primeList = primes(n); % Get all prime numbers up to n\n    numPrimes = length(primeList);\n    productMatrix = []; % Matrix to store products of two distinct primes\n\n    % Generate products of two distinct prime numbers\n    for i = 1:numPrimes\n        for j = (i+1):numPrimes\n            product = primeList(i) * primeList(j);\n            if product <= n\n                productMatrix = [productMatrix; product]; %#ok<AGROW>\n            else\n                break;\n            end\n        end\n    end\n\n    % Calculate the largest prime factor for each number\n    largestPrimeFactors = max(primeList(ismember(productMatrix, primeList')), [], 2);\n    \n    % Calculate the sum of the largest prime factors\n    sumLargestPrimeFactors = sum(largestPrimeFactors);\n    \n    % Calculate the average of the largest prime factors\n    avgLargestPrimeFactors = sumLargestPrimeFactors / length(largestPrimeFactors);\n\n    % Display the results\n    fprintf('The sum of the largest prime factors is: %d\\n', sumLargestPrimeFactors);\n    fprintf('The average of the largest prime factors is: %.2f\\n', avgLargestPrimeFactors);\nend\n\n% Example usage\nn = 100; % Define an upper limit for prime numbers\naverage = calculateAverageLargestPrimeFactors(n);\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Prime Number List**: We first generate a list of prime numbers up to a given number `n` using the `primes` function.\n\n2. **Distinct Prime Products**: We iterate through this list to find the product of every pair of distinct primes. If the product is less than or equal to `n`, it is stored in `productMatrix`.\n\n3. **Largest Prime Factors**: For each number in `productMatrix`, the largest prime factor is calculated. Since each number is a product of exactly two distinct primes, the largest prime factor will always be the larger of the two primes that form the product.\n\n4. **Summation and Averaging**: The sum of these largest prime factors is then computed, followed by the calculation of their average.\n\n5. **Output**: The script finally outputs the sum and the average of the largest prime factors.\n\nThis script provides a clear way to find the required matrix, calculate the necessary sums, and then find the average. Adjust the `n` variable to change the upper limit of the prime numbers considered."
