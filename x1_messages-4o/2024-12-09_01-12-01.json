I am trying to find a generic way to call a parent class initializer within an initializer. The current method I am using involves passing the correct type by hand which seems a bit non-generic. I tried using `self.__class__` as the first argument to `super()`, but it resulted in an infinite recursion. Is there a better way to do this?\n\nHere's my current code:\n\n```python\nclass A(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        print \"Initialiser A was called\"\n\nclass B(A):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(B,self).__init__()\n        print \"Initialiser B was called\"\n\nclass C(B):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(C,self).__init__()\n        print \"Initialiser C was called\"\n\nc = C()\n```"

        "content": "In Python, you can use the `super()` function more conveniently without needing to pass the class and instance explicitly. This is especially useful in instances where you may want to maintain flexibility with class hierarchies and avoid hardcoding class names.\n\nStarting from Python 3, `super()` can be called without any arguments, and it will automatically determine the class and instance to work with. This makes your code cleaner and more adaptable to changes in class hierarchies.\n\nHere's how you can update your code to make use of this feature in a more generic way:\n\n```python\nclass A(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        print(\"Initializer A was called\")\n\nclass B(A):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        print(\"Initializer B was called\")\n\nclass C(B):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        print(\"Initializer C was called\")\n\nc = C()\n```\n\nIn this updated code:\n\n- `super()` without arguments automatically finds the correct superclass for the current class and instance, eliminating the need to specify them manually.\n- This approach also helps prevent errors if you ever change the class hierarchy or rename classes, as you don't have to update the `super()` calls accordingly.\n\nBy using `super()` without arguments, your code will be more maintainable and less error-prone, especially in complex class hierarchies."
