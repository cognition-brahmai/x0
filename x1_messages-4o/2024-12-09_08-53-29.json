However, for the last character, you can decide how you want to handle it, such as wrapping around to the first character or leaving it unchanged. Here's a simple example that wraps the last character to the first character:\n\n```python\ndef shift_characters_right(s):\n    if not s:\n        return s  # Return the original string if it's empty\n\n    # Create a new string by taking the substring from the second character to the end and appending the first character\n    shifted_string = s[1:] + s[0]\n    return shifted_string\n\n# Example usage:\noriginal_string = \"abcdef\"\nnew_string = shift_characters_right(original_string)\nprint(\"Original String:\", original_string)\nprint(\"New String:\", new_string)\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `shift_characters_right` takes a string `s` and returns a new string where each character is replaced by the character immediately to its right, with the last character wrapping around to the first character."
