For example, if you were born in 1990, you would pay a tax of $1,939 (1+9+9+0=19). However, the tax system in this country only takes into account the sum of the digits in your birth year if the year is a prime number. \nWhat is the tax amount for someone born in the year 2001 in this country?"

        "content": "To determine the tax amount for someone born in the year 2001, we first need to check if the year 2001 is a prime number. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nFirst, let's check if 2001 is divisible by any prime numbers up to its approximate square root. The square root of 2001 is about 44.7, so we need to check divisibility by the prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, and 43.\n\n- 2001 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2.\n- The sum of the digits of 2001 is 2 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 3, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 2001 is divisible by 3.\n\nSince 2001 is divisible by 3, it is not a prime number. As a result, according to the tax system in this country, no tax is charged because the year is not a prime number.\n\nTherefore, the tax amount for someone born in the year 2001 is $0."
