        "content": "To determine if the given triangle with side lengths of 3, 4, and 5 is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.\n\nFor the given triangle with side lengths 3, 4, and 5:\n\n1. Identify the hypotenuse, which is the longest side. In this case, it's 5.\n2. Apply the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n   \\[\n   a^2 + b^2 = c^2\n   \\]\n\n   Where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the lengths of the two shorter sides, and \\(c\\) is the length of the hypotenuse.\n\n   \\[\n   3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   9 + 16 = 25\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   25 = 25\n   \\]\n\nSince the equation holds true, the triangle with side lengths 3, 4, and 5 is indeed a right triangle.\n\n### Visual Representation\n\nUnfortunately, as a text-based AI, I cannot directly generate computer images. However, you can visualize this triangle by drawing it on a graph or using a drawing tool. Place a point at the origin (0,0), another point at (3,0), and the third point at (0,4). Connect these points to form a right triangle with the right angle at the origin.\n\n### Generalization for 3:4:5 Ratio\n\nThe 3:4:5 ratio is a classic example of a Pythagorean triple. A Pythagorean triple consists of three positive integers \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), such that \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The 3:4:5 triangle is the smallest and most well-known Pythagorean triple.\n\nTo generalize, any triangle with side lengths in the ratio of 3:4:5 will be a right triangle. This is because:\n\n- Let the side lengths be \\(3k\\), \\(4k\\), and \\(5k\\), where \\(k\\) is a positive integer.\n- Applying the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n  \\[\n  (3k)^2 + (4k)^2 = (5k)^2\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  9k^2 + 16k^2 = 25k^2\n  \\]\n\n  \\[\n  25k^2 = 25k^2\n  \\]\n\nThis equation is true for any positive integer \\(k\\), confirming that any triangle with side lengths in the ratio of 3:4:5 is a right triangle."
