        "content": "In Django 2.0, the `allow_tags` attribute was removed, and developers are encouraged to use safer alternatives to render HTML in the Django admin. Here's how you can achieve similar functionality without the `allow_tags` attribute:\n\n1. **Use `mark_safe`**: The preferred way to render HTML in the Django admin is by using the `mark_safe` function from `django.utils.safestring`. This function is used to explicitly mark a string as safe for HTML output.\n\n2. **Creating a custom method**: You can create a custom method in your `ModelAdmin` class to return HTML, and use `mark_safe` to ensure it's rendered properly.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nSuppose you have a `Book` model and you want to display a link to the book's detail page in the admin list view.\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom django.utils.safestring import mark_safe\nfrom .models import Book\n\nclass BookAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    list_display = ('title', 'author', 'view_link')\n\n    def view_link(self, obj):\n        # Construct the HTML link and mark it safe\n        return mark_safe(f'<a href=\"/books/{obj.pk}/\">View</a>')\n\n    view_link.short_description = 'View Link'  # Optional: Customize the column name\n\nadmin.site.register(Book, BookAdmin)\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- We define a method `view_link` in the `BookAdmin` class.\n- We construct a simple HTML link and use `mark_safe` to ensure Django treats it as safe HTML.\n- We add `view_link` to the `list_display` to include it in the admin list view.\n\nRemember, using `mark_safe` means you take responsibility for ensuring the HTML you generate is safe and secure, as it bypasses Django's built-in escaping mechanisms. Always validate and sanitize any user-generated content to prevent security vulnerabilities like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)."
