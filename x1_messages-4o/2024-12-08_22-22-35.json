Here are a few things that might help:\n\n1. **Break it Down**: Sometimes, decisions feel overwhelming because we're looking at the big picture. Try breaking things down into smaller, more manageable steps. Focus on one part at a time.\n\n2. **Pros and Cons**: List the pros and cons of each option you are considering. This can help clarify your thoughts and might make the decision easier.\n\n3. **Trust Yourself**: Remember that it's okay to not have everything figured out. Trust in your ability to make decisions, even if they're not perfect.\n\n4. **Seek Guidance**: Sometimes talking it out with someone you trust can provide new perspectives. They might offer advice or just be a sounding board for your thoughts.\n\n5. **Take a Break**: Stepping away from the situation for a bit can help clear your mind. Engage in an activity you enjoy, and you might find that the answer comes more naturally afterward.\n\nRemember, it's okay to make mistakes and learn from them. Each decision is a step forward, even if it feels like you're stuck. You're doing your best, and that's what matters."
