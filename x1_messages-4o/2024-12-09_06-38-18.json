        "content": "Before the Fermi architecture, NVIDIA's GPUs had a different architecture design. For instance, in the Tesla architecture (which predates Fermi), each multiprocessor had 8 Streaming Processors (SPs), and each SP could handle a single thread at a time. Therefore, each multiprocessor had 8 CUDA cores.\n\nWith the introduction of the Fermi architecture, NVIDIA made significant changes. In Fermi, each Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) contains 32 CUDA cores. This was a substantial increase compared to previous architectures. The Fermi architecture marked a shift in design philosophy, aiming to improve both performance and programmability.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n- Pre-Fermi architectures, like Tesla, had 8 SPs per multiprocessor.\n- Fermi architecture increased this to 32 CUDA cores per multiprocessor."
