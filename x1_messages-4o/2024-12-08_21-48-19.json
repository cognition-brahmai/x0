However, if you need new columns for some reason, you can use the following SQL command:\n\n```sql\nALTER TABLE garden_features\nADD COLUMN new_category1_description TEXT,\nADD COLUMN new_category2_description TEXT,\nADD COLUMN new_category3_description TEXT;\n```\n\nIf instead, you need to add new rows for new categories, you won\u2019t need to alter the table structure, provided it already has the required columns.\n\n### Step 2: Insert New Categories\n\nInsert new categories into the table with their descriptions, purposes, and contributions:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO garden_features (category, description, purpose, contribution)\nVALUES\n('Water Feature', 'A fountain or pond that adds a soothing element to the garden.', 'To provide a relaxing auditory experience and attract wildlife.', 'Enhances the calming aesthetics and creates a focal point.'),\n('Sculptural Element', 'Artistic statues or installations that add character.', 'To serve as a centerpiece and reflect personal style.', 'Adds visual interest and can define the theme of the garden.'),\n('Herb Garden', 'A section dedicated to growing herbs for culinary use.', 'To provide fresh ingredients for cooking and fragrance.', 'Increases functionality by offering a practical use and enhances sensory appeal.');\n```\n\n### Displaying the New Entries\n\nTo display the new categories along with their descriptions, purposes, and contributions, you can execute a `SELECT` query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT category, description, purpose, contribution\nFROM garden_features\nWHERE category IN ('Water Feature', 'Sculptural Element', 'Herb Garden');\n```\n\nThis query will return the entries for the new categories you\u2019ve added, displaying all the relevant information about their purpose and contribution to the garden's aesthetics and functionality. If you want to see all features including the new ones, simply remove the `WHERE` clause:\n\n```sql\nSELECT category, description, purpose, contribution\nFROM garden_features;\n```\n\nThis setup allows you to efficiently update and retrieve information about the different features in your garden, enhancing both its functionality and aesthetic appeal."
