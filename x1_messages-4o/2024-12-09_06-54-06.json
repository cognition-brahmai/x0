        "content": "Parsing `.msg` files, which are Outlook email files, can be a bit tricky because they are in a proprietary binary format. However, you can use a third-party library like `extract-msg` to make the process easier. This library is specifically designed for handling `.msg` files. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use it:\n\n1. **Install the `extract-msg` library**:\n   You can install it using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install extract-msg\n   ```\n\n2. **Parse the `.msg` file**:\n   Once the library is installed, you can use it to read and extract data from the `.msg` files. Here is a basic example:\n\n   ```python\n   import extract_msg\n\n   # Load the .msg file\n   msg = extract_msg.Message('path_to_your_file.msg')\n\n   # Extract various components\n   subject = msg.subject\n   sender = msg.sender\n   date = msg.date\n   to = msg.to\n   cc = msg.cc\n   bcc = msg.bcc\n   body = msg.body\n   attachments = msg.attachments\n\n   # Print extracted data\n   print(\"Subject:\", subject)\n   print(\"Sender:\", sender)\n   print(\"Date:\", date)\n   print(\"To:\", to)\n   print(\"CC:\", cc)\n   print(\"BCC:\", bcc)\n   print(\"Body:\", body)\n\n   # If you want to process attachments\n   for attachment in attachments:\n       print(\"Attachment:\", attachment.longFilename)\n       # Save the attachment if needed\n       # attachment.save(custom_path)\n   ```\n\n3. **Handle attachments**:\n   `.msg` files often contain attachments, and `extract-msg` can help you handle these as well. As shown in the code above, you can iterate over `msg.attachments` to access each attachment's properties and save them if needed.\n\n4. **Error handling**:\n   Always add appropriate error handling, especially while dealing with file operations, to ensure your application can gracefully handle any issues.\n\nBy using `extract-msg`, you should be able to efficiently parse `.msg` files and extract all necessary information without having to dive into the complexities of the binary format."
