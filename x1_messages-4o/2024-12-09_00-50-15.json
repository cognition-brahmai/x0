I have set the logging files to the levels I want (usr.log = INFO and dev.log = ERROR), but I am unable to restrict logging to the usr.log file so that only INFO level logs are written to it, rather than INFO plus everything else above it (WARNING, ERROR and CRITICAL). Below is my current code:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\nlogger1 = logging.getLogger('')\nlogger1.addHandler(logging.FileHandler('/home/tmp/usr.log')\nlogger1.setLevel(logging.INFO)\nlogger2 = logging.getLogger('')\nlogger2.addHandler(logging.FileHandler('/home/tmp/dev.log')\nlogger2.setLevel(logging.ERROR)\n\nlogging.critical('this to be logged in dev.log only')\nlogging.info('this to be logged to usr.log and dev.log')\nlogging.warning('this to be logged to dev.log only')\n```\nHow can I modify my code to achieve this?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired logging behavior where you restrict the logging to `usr.log` to only include `INFO` level messages and not higher levels like `WARNING`, `ERROR`, or `CRITICAL`, you'll need to use filters in the logging module. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\n# Create a custom filter to allow only INFO level logs\nclass InfoFilter(logging.Filter):\n    def filter(self, record):\n        return record.levelno == logging.INFO\n\n# Set up the user logger\nuser_logger = logging.getLogger('user')\nuser_handler = logging.FileHandler('/home/tmp/usr.log')\nuser_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)\nuser_handler.addFilter(InfoFilter())  # Add the custom filter\nuser_logger.addHandler(user_handler)\nuser_logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)\n\n# Set up the developer logger\ndev_logger = logging.getLogger('dev')\ndev_handler = logging.FileHandler('/home/tmp/dev.log')\ndev_handler.setLevel(logging.ERROR)\ndev_logger.addHandler(dev_handler)\ndev_logger.setLevel(logging.ERROR)\n\n# Log messages\nuser_logger.critical('this to be logged in dev.log only')\nuser_logger.info('this to be logged to usr.log only')\nuser_logger.warning('this to be logged in dev.log only')\n\ndev_logger.critical('this to be logged in dev.log only')\ndev_logger.info('this will not be logged anywhere')\ndev_logger.warning('this to be logged in dev.log only')\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n\n1. **Custom Filter:** A custom filter `InfoFilter` is created to only allow `INFO` level logs to pass through to the `usr.log` file.\n\n2. **Separate Loggers:** Two separate loggers (`user_logger` and `dev_logger`) are created to handle logs to different files. This helps to manage different logging behaviors independently.\n\n3. **Filtering:** The `InfoFilter` is added to the user logger's handler to ensure that only `INFO` level logs are written to `usr.log`.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- `InfoFilter` is a custom filter class that overrides the `filter` method to return `True` only for `INFO` level records.\n- By adding this filter to the `user_handler`, you ensure that only `INFO` level logs are passed to the `usr.log` file.\n- Separate loggers (`user_logger` and `dev_logger`) provide more granular control over logging behaviors and separation of concerns.\n\nThis setup ensures that `usr.log` contains only `INFO` level logs, while `dev.log` contains `ERROR` and above logs."
