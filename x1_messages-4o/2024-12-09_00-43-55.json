        "content": "To prevent annotation text from overlapping in your matplotlib graph, you can use a combination of strategies to adjust the positioning of the annotations. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Offset the Annotations**: You can add an offset to the position of your annotations to prevent them from overlapping. You can use the `xytext` parameter in `plt.annotate` to specify the offset.\n\n2. **Use the `bbox` Parameter**: The `bbox` parameter can help in creating a background for the text which can make it more readable even if it overlaps slightly.\n\n3. **Adjust the Annotation Angle**: You can rotate the text using the `rotation` parameter to make it fit better.\n\n4. **Dynamic Adjustment**: Implement a logic to dynamically adjust the position of the annotations based on nearby annotations, though this can be more complex.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify your code to apply some of these strategies:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Start a new plot\nplt.clf()\nplt.xlabel(\"Proportional Euclidean Distance\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Percentage Timewindows Attended\")\nplt.title(\"Test plot\")\n\ntogether = [(0, 1.0, 0.4), (25, 1.0127692669427917, 0.41), (50, 1.016404709797609, 0.41), \n            (75, 1.1043426359673716, 0.42), (100, 1.1610446924342996, 0.44), \n            (125, 1.1685687930691457, 0.43), (150, 1.3486407784550272, 0.45), \n            (250, 1.4013999168008104, 0.45)]\ntogether.sort()\n\nfor i, (x, y, z) in enumerate(together):\n    # Apply an offset to the annotation position\n    offset = (-10, 10) if i % 2 == 0 else (10, -10)\n    plt.annotate(\n        str(x), xy=(y, z), xytext=offset, textcoords='offset points',\n        size=8, bbox=dict(boxstyle=\"round,pad=0.3\", edgecolor='gray', facecolor='white', alpha=0.6),\n        arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', connectionstyle='arc3,rad=0.1', color='gray')\n    )\n\neucs = [y for (x, y, z) in together]\ncovers = [z for (x, z) in together]\n\nplt.plot(eucs, covers, color=\"black\", alpha=0.5)\n\nplt.savefig(\"test.png\")\n```\n\nIn this modified code:\n- An offset is applied alternately to the annotations to separate them visually.\n- A `bbox` is added to each annotation with a slight transparency to make them stand out.\n- An `arrowprops` is added to draw an arrow pointing from the text to the data point, which helps in associating the annotation with its respective point.\n\nYou can further tweak these parameters to suit your specific needs."
