        "content": "I have been working on converting two models (vgg16 and resnet50) from Keras with TensorFlow backend into PyTorch using mmdnn. The conversion was successful as shown by the following code:\n```python\nmmconvert -sf keras -iw vgg.h5 -df pytorch -om keras_to_torch.pt\n\nA = imp.load_source('MainModel','/weights/keras_to_torch.py')\nmodel = torch.load('/weights/keras_to_torch.pt')\n```\nHowever, when I predict on the same dataset, I get different results. On further investigation, I observed that the weights for all the convolutional layers are the same (after transposing) but the weights of the fully connected layers at the end are not. Shouldn't they be equivalent? Why is there a discrepancy in the weights of the fully connected layers?"

        "content": "When converting models between different frameworks, discrepancies in the weights, especially in the fully connected layers, can occur due to several reasons:\n\n1. **Difference in Layer Configuration**: The fully connected layers might have different configurations or parameters between Keras and PyTorch. Ensure that the number of units, activation functions, and other configurations are the same in both models.\n\n2. **Weight Initialization**: Sometimes, the conversion process might not map the weights correctly due to differences in the initialization schemes or due to a mismatch in layer definitions between the frameworks.\n\n3. **Order of Weights**: In some cases, the order of weights or the way they are flattened and stored can differ between Keras and PyTorch. Ensure that during the conversion, the weights are correctly mapped and reordered if necessary.\n\n4. **Data Preprocessing**: Ensure that the data preprocessing steps (such as normalization and resizing) are consistent between the original Keras model and the converted PyTorch model. Differences in preprocessing can lead to different predictions.\n\n5. **Biases and Batch Norm Layers**: The handling of biases and batch normalization layers might differ between frameworks. Ensure these are correctly converted and initialized.\n\n6. **Conversion Tool Limitations**: The conversion tool itself might have limitations or bugs that lead to incorrect weight mapping. Check if there are any known issues with the `mmdnn` conversion tool regarding the specific layers or architectures you are using.\n\nTo debug this issue, you can:\n\n- Print and compare the weights of the fully connected layers before and after conversion to see if there's a consistent pattern in the differences.\n- Manually verify and, if necessary, adjust the weights of the fully connected layers after conversion.\n- Test the conversion with a simpler model to isolate and identify potential issues with the conversion process.\n\nIf the problem persists, it might be helpful to consult the documentation or community forums for `mmdnn` for any known issues or solutions related to this specific conversion scenario."
