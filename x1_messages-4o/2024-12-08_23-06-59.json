The basic syntax is:\n\n```bash\ngrep \"word\" filename\n```\n\nFor case-insensitive search, use the `-i` option:\n\n```bash\ngrep -i \"word\" filename\n```\n\nRegarding the missing word in the statement \"Our new relaxation app is like a ____ for your mind\", if you tried searching for the word \"shuttle\" using the command:\n\n```bash\ngrep -i \"shuttle\" file.txt\n```\n\nThis command will search for the word \"shuttle\" in the file `file.txt` in a case-insensitive manner. If the word \"shuttle\" exists in that file, it will return the lines containing the word. If it doesn't return any lines, then \"shuttle\" might not be the word you're looking for in that context."
