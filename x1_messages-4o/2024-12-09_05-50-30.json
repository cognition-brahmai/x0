I have a current query where I want to add a condition to select data between the dates of the last 30 days.

        "content": "To filter your queryset to include only the records created within the last 30 days, you can use the `__range` lookup in Django ORM, which allows you to specify a range of values for a field. In your case, you want to filter the `created_at` field to be within the last 30 days. Here's how you can modify your query to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport datetime\nfrom django.utils import timezone\n\n# Calculate the start date (30 days ago)\nstart_date = timezone.now() - datetime.timedelta(days=30)\n\n# Filter the queryset to include only records created within the last 30 days\ncontext[self.varname] = self.model._default_manager.filter(\n    current_issue__isnull=True,\n    created_at__range=(start_date, timezone.now())\n).live().order_by('-created_at')\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the changes made:\n\n1. **Import `timezone`**: It's generally a good practice to use `timezone.now()` instead of `datetime.datetime.now()` in Django projects to ensure that timezone-aware datetime objects are used, especially if your project is configured to use time zones.\n\n2. **Calculate the start date**: `start_date` is calculated as 30 days ago from the current time.\n\n3. **Use `__range` lookup**: The `created_at__range=(start_date, timezone.now())` part filters the records where `created_at` falls between `start_date` and the current time, effectively giving you the records created in the last 30 days.\n\nThis should give you the desired result, filtering records based on the `created_at` field to include only those created within the last 30 days."
