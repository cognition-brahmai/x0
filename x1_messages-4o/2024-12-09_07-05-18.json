The code I'm using is:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt(A)\n```\nThe figure is generated correctly, however, when the plot is created, there are a thousand lines of the following output: `<matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0xXXXXXXXX>`. How can I disable this output?"

        "content": "When you plot using `matplotlib.pyplot`, it returns a list of `Line2D` objects, which are the individual lines plotted. The output you see is this list being printed in the console. To suppress this output, you can assign the result of the plot to a variable, or simply add a semicolon at the end of the plot command. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Assign the plot to a variable:\n    ```python\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n    line_objects = plt.plot(A)\n    ```\n\n2. Use a semicolon to suppress the output:\n    ```python\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n    plt.plot(A);\n    ```\n\nBoth methods will prevent the list of `Line2D` objects from being printed to the console."
