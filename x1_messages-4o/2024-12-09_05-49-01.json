Currently, I have a solution that checks if the output is a list and creates an iterator accordingly. However, this solution seems inefficient and inelegant. How can I improve it?\n\nHere is the existing code:\n\n```python\nx = UnknownFunction()\nif islist(x):\n    iterator = x\nelse:\n    iterator = [x]\n\ndef islist(s):\n    try:\n        len(s)\n        return True\n    except TypeError:\n        return False\n\nfor ii in iterator:\n    #do stuff\n```"

        "content": "Your current approach is functional but can be refined. Instead of using a custom `islist` function, you can use Python's built-in `collections.abc` module to check if an object is iterable. This will make your code more robust and Pythonic. Here's how you can improve it:\n\n```python\nfrom collections.abc import Iterable\n\nx = UnknownFunction()\n\n# Check if x is an iterable and not a string or bytes (since strings and bytes are also iterable)\nif isinstance(x, Iterable) and not isinstance(x, (str, bytes)):\n    iterator = x\nelse:\n    iterator = [x]\n\nfor ii in iterator:\n    # Do stuff\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Using `collections.abc.Iterable`:** The `isinstance(x, Iterable)` check helps you determine if `x` is an iterable object. Unlike your custom `islist` function, this approach is more general and works with any iterable, not just lists.\n\n2. **Avoiding Strings and Bytes:** Since strings and bytes are also iterable, you might not want to treat them as such in this context. The `not isinstance(x, (str, bytes))` check ensures that strings and bytes are treated as single items.\n\n3. **Creating the Iterator:** If `x` is not an iterable (or is a string/bytes), it is wrapped in a list to create an iterable for the loop.\n\nThis method provides a more elegant and flexible solution to handling various types returned by your function."
