        "content": "Certainly! Instead of looping through each row and checking the elements, you can use NumPy's powerful array operations to achieve this more efficiently. You can take advantage of the `numpy.all()` function, which tests whether all elements along a given axis evaluate to `True`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Assuming M is your numpy matrix\nM = np.array([\n    [0, 0, 0],\n    [1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 1, 0]\n])\n\n# Use numpy.all() to check for rows where all elements are zero\nzero_rows_indices = np.where(np.all(M == 0, axis=1))[0]\n\nprint(\"Indices of rows with all elements as zero:\", zero_rows_indices)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `M == 0` creates a boolean matrix where each element is `True` if it is zero, and `False` otherwise.\n- `np.all(M == 0, axis=1)` checks each row (since `axis=1`), returning `True` if all elements in the row are `True` (i.e., all elements are zero).\n- `np.where(...)` then finds the indices where the condition is `True`.\n\nThis approach is vectorized, making it much faster than looping through the matrix manually, especially for large matrices."
