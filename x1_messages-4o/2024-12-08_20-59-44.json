        "content": "To solve these problems using Swift, we need to apply various geometry formulas. Below is the Swift code for each problem:\n\n### Problem 1: Circle Inscribed in a Square\n\nFor a circle inscribed in a square, the diameter of the circle is equal to the side of the square. Therefore, the side of the square is twice the radius of the circle.\n\n1. **Radius of Circle**: \\( r = 5 \\)\n2. **Side of Square**: \\( s = 2 \\times r = 10 \\)\n3. **Area of Circle**: \\( \\pi \\times r^2 \\)\n4. **Area of Square**: \\( s^2 \\)\n5. **Ratio of Areas**: \\(\\frac{\\text{Area of Circle}}{\\text{Area of Square}}\\)\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nfunc ratioOfCircleToSquareArea(radius: Double) -> Double {\n    let areaOfCircle = Double.pi * pow(radius, 2)\n    let sideOfSquare = 2 * radius\n    let areaOfSquare = pow(sideOfSquare, 2)\n    return areaOfCircle / areaOfSquare\n}\n\nlet radius = 5.0\nlet ratio = ratioOfCircleToSquareArea(radius: radius)\nprint(\"Ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square: \\(ratio)\")\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Area of a Regular Octagon\n\nTo find the area of a regular octagon with side length \\( a \\):\n\n1. **Formula**: \\( \\text{Area} = 2 \\times (1 + \\sqrt{2}) \\times a^2 \\)\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nfunc areaOfRegularOctagon(sideLength: Double) -> Double {\n    let area = 2 * (1 + sqrt(2)) * pow(sideLength, 2)\n    return round(area * 10) / 10.0\n}\n\nlet sideLength = 6.0\nlet octagonArea = areaOfRegularOctagon(sideLength: sideLength)\nprint(\"Area of the octagon: \\(octagonArea) cm\u00b2\")\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Radius of the Inscribed Circle in a Triangle\n\nFor a triangle with sides \\( a = 10 \\), \\( b = 12 \\), and \\( c = 15 \\):\n\n1. **Semi-perimeter**: \\( s = \\frac{a + b + c}{2} \\)\n2. **Area of Triangle (Heron's formula)**: \\( \\sqrt{s \\times (s - a) \\times (s - b) \\times (s - c)} \\)\n3. **Radius of Inscribed Circle**: \\( \\frac{\\text{Area of Triangle}}{s} \\)\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nfunc radiusOfInscribedCircle(a: Double, b: Double, c: Double) -> Double {\n    let s = (a + b + c) / 2\n    let area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))\n    let radius = area / s\n    return round(radius * 100) / 100.0\n}\n\nlet a = 10.0, b = 12.0, c = 15.0\nlet inscribedCircleRadius = radiusOfInscribedCircle(a: a, b: b, c: c)\nprint(\"Radius of the inscribed circle: \\(inscribedCircleRadius)\")\n```\n\nThese Swift functions calculate the desired values by applying the appropriate geometry formulas for each problem."
