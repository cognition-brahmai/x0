However, when I try to import the file, KCacheGrind shows an 'Unknown File Format' error in the status bar and fails to display anything. What should I do to make the profiling stats compatible with KCacheGrind? Here's the code snippet that I'm working with:\n\n```\n...\nif profile:\n    import cProfile\n\n    profileFileName = 'Profiles/pythonray_' + time.strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S') + '.profile'\n\n    profile = cProfile.Profile()\n    profile.run('pilImage = camera.render(scene, samplePattern)')\n\n    profile.dump_stats(profileFileName)\n    profile.print_stats()\nelse:            \n    pilImage = camera.render(scene, samplePattern)\n...\n```\n\nI'm using KCacheGrind 4.3.1 and Python 2.6.2."

        "content": "To convert the cProfile output into a format that KCacheGrind can understand, you need to transform the profile data into the Callgrind format. This can be done using a tool like `pyprof2calltree`, which is specifically designed for this purpose.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:\n\n1. **Install `pyprof2calltree`:**\n\n   First, you'll need to install `pyprof2calltree`. You can do this using `pip`. Since you're using Python 2.6.2, make sure you have `pip` installed for your environment.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pyprof2calltree\n   ```\n\n2. **Convert the Profile Data:**\n\n   After you've generated your profile data using `cProfile`, you can convert it to the Callgrind format using `pyprof2calltree`.\n\n   Run the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   pyprof2calltree -k -i Profiles/pythonray_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.profile\n   ```\n\n   Replace `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` with the actual timestamp that matches your generated profile file.\n\n   The `-k` option automatically opens KCacheGrind with the converted file, and `-i` specifies the input file.\n\n3. **Load the Converted File in KCacheGrind:**\n\n   If you used the `-k` option, KCacheGrind should open automatically with the converted file. If not, locate the output file generated by `pyprof2calltree` (it will have a `.callgrind` extension) and open it manually in KCacheGrind.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to view your profiling data in KCacheGrind without encountering the 'Unknown File Format' error. \n\nAdditionally, consider upgrading your Python version if possible, as Python 2.6.2 is quite outdated and may lack support for some newer libraries and tools."
