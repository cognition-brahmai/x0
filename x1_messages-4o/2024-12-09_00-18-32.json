        "content": "In Python 3, the `keys()` method of a dictionary returns a view object, which behaves like a set rather than a list. To convert the dictionary keys to a list, you can use the `list()` function to explicitly convert the view object to a list. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Suppose you have a dictionary\nmy_dict = {1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c'}\n\n# Get the keys as a list\nkeys_list = list(my_dict.keys())\n\nprint(keys_list)  # Output will be [1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nBy wrapping the `my_dict.keys()` with `list()`, you convert the keys view object into a list, which is why you see the output in the list format `[1, 2, 3]`."
