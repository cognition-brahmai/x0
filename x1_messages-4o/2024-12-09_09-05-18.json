        "content": "To create a Java method that determines whether an integer is even or odd and prints the result, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Define a method that takes an integer as a parameter.\n2. Use the modulus operator `%` to determine if the number is even or odd.\n3. Print the result based on the modulus operation.\n\nHere is a sample implementation:\n\n```java\npublic class EvenOddChecker {\n\n    // Method to check if a number is even or odd\n    public static void checkEvenOdd(int number) {\n        if (number % 2 == 0) {\n            System.out.println(number + \" is even.\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(number + \" is odd.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Test the method with different numbers\n        checkEvenOdd(10);  // Output: 10 is even.\n        checkEvenOdd(7);   // Output: 7 is odd.\n        checkEvenOdd(0);   // Output: 0 is even.\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- The `checkEvenOdd` method takes an integer `number` as an argument.\n- It uses `number % 2` to determine if the number is even. If the remainder is `0`, it prints that the number is even; otherwise, it prints that the number is odd.\n- The `main` method is used to test the `checkEvenOdd` method with different integers.\n\nYou can run this code in any Java development environment or a simple Java compiler to see the results."
