        "content": "This error typically occurs when there is a mismatch between the MySQL client libraries and the MySQL-Python package. Here are some steps you can follow to try and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Compatibility**: Make sure that the MySQL client library version is compatible with the MySQL-Python version you have installed. You may need to update or downgrade one or the other to ensure compatibility.\n\n2. **Upgrade MySQL-Python Package**: Try upgrading the MySQL-python package to the latest version. You can do this using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade MySQL-python\n   ```\n\n3. **Reinstall MySQL-Python with Static Linking**: Sometimes, recompiling the package with static linking can help resolve issues. You can force a reinstallation using:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall MySQL-python\n   pip install MySQL-python --no-cache-dir\n   ```\n\n4. **Use `mysqlclient` Instead**: The `MySQL-python` package is outdated, and it might be better to switch to `mysqlclient`, which is a fork of `MySQL-python` and is actively maintained. To install `mysqlclient`, run:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall MySQL-python\n   pip install mysqlclient\n   ```\n\n   Then, update your Django `settings.py` to reflect this change, if necessary.\n\n5. **Ensure Correct Python Environment**: Double-check that you are using the correct Python environment and that all dependencies are installed in this environment. You can check the active environment using:\n\n   ```bash\n   which python\n   ```\n\n6. **Check for MacOS Specific Issues**: Since you are using OSX 10.8, ensure that you have the necessary developer tools and libraries installed. Sometimes, missing developer tools can cause such issues. Ensure you have Xcode and the Command Line Tools installed:\n\n   ```bash\n   xcode-select --install\n   ```\n\n7. **Verify MySQL Installation**: Make sure that your MySQL installation is complete and that the necessary libraries are correctly linked. Reinstalling MySQL from a reliable source or using a package manager like Homebrew may help:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew install mysql\n   ```\n\n8. **Rebuild the Python Egg Cache**: Clear the Python egg cache and rebuild it. Delete the contents of the `.python-eggs` directory and rerun your project.\n\nIf the above steps do not resolve the issue, consider checking online forums or the GitHub issues page for the MySQL-python or mysqlclient project for similar issues and potential fixes."
