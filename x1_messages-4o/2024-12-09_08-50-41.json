        "content": "There are several algorithms to sort an array of integers, each with its own advantages and use cases. One of the most common and straightforward algorithms is the **Quick Sort**. Here's a basic overview of how Quick Sort works:\n\n1. **Choose a Pivot**: Select an element from the array to be the pivot. This element will be used to partition the array into two halves. Common strategies for choosing a pivot include picking the first element, the last element, a random element, or the median.\n\n2. **Partitioning**: Rearrange the array so that all elements less than the pivot are on its left, and all elements greater than the pivot are on its right. The pivot is then in its final position.\n\n3. **Recursive Sort**: Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-arrays formed by partitioning. The base case for recursion is when the sub-array has zero or one element, as it is already sorted.\n\n4. **Combine**: Since Quick Sort is an in-place sort, there's no need to combine sub-arrays. After the final recursive call, the array is sorted.\n\nHere's a simple implementation in Python:\n\n```python\ndef quick_sort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    else:\n        pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]\n        left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]\n        middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]\n        right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]\n        return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)\n\n# Example usage:\narray = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]\nsorted_array = quick_sort(array)\nprint(sorted_array)\n```\n\nQuick Sort is generally efficient with an average time complexity of \\(O(n \\log n)\\), but it can degrade to \\(O(n^2)\\) in the worst case, such as when the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot. To mitigate this, advanced implementations use randomized pivot selection or the Median-of-Three method."
