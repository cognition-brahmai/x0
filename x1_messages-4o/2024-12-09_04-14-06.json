I have attempted to extend the example provided in the documentation (which shows how to upload a single file) to upload multiple files. Here is my code:\n\n```python\nfiles = {'file': [open('report.xls', 'rb'), open('report2.xls, 'rb')]}\n```\n\nHowever, this resulted in an error:\n\n```python\nFile \"/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/urllib.py\", line 1052, in splittype\n    match = _typeprog.match(url)\nTypeError: expected string or buffer\n```\n\nI'm trying to figure out if it is possible to upload a list of files using a single request with this module, and if so, how would I go about doing it?"

        "content": "To upload multiple files in a single request using the `requests` module in Python, you need to correctly structure the `files` dictionary. Each key in the dictionary should correspond to a form field name and its value should be a tuple containing the filename, a file object, and optionally the content type. Here's how you can modify your code to upload multiple files:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# Open the files you want to upload\nfile1 = open('report.xls', 'rb')\nfile2 = open('report2.xls', 'rb')\n\n# Create the files dictionary with the correct structure\nfiles = {\n    'file1': ('report.xls', file1, 'application/vnd.ms-excel'),\n    'file2': ('report2.xls', file2, 'application/vnd.ms-excel')\n}\n\n# Perform the request\nresponse = requests.post('http://your-server.com/upload', files=files)\n\n# Check the response\nprint(response.status_code)\nprint(response.text)\n\n# Close the files after the request is done\nfile1.close()\nfile2.close()\n```\n\nIn the `files` dictionary, each key (like `'file1'` and `'file2'`) is the form field name for each file you are uploading. The tuple contains the filename, the file object, and the MIME type. It's important to close the file objects after the request to free up system resources.\n\nMake sure to replace `'http://your-server.com/upload'` with the actual endpoint URL you are sending the request to. Adjust the content type if necessary based on the file types you are uploading."
