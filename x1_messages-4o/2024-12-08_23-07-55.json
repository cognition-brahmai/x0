You decide to implement the Pomodoro technique, which involves working in focused 25-minute intervals followed by 5-minute breaks. \nCan you provide a sample implementation of the Pomodoro technique using Python code to help your team get started?"

        "content": "Certainly! The Pomodoro Technique is a great way to boost productivity by breaking work into intervals. Below is a simple Python implementation using the `time` module to help your team get started:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef pomodoro_timer(work_duration=25, break_duration=5, sessions=4):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simple Pomodoro timer implementation.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    - work_duration: Duration of work period in minutes (default is 25)\n    - break_duration: Duration of break period in minutes (default is 5)\n    - sessions: Number of Pomodoro sessions (default is 4)\n    \"\"\"\n    work_seconds = work_duration * 60\n    break_seconds = break_duration * 60\n\n    for session in range(1, sessions + 1):\n        print(f\"Session {session}: Work for {work_duration} minutes.\")\n        time.sleep(work_seconds)\n        print(f\"Session {session}: Time to take a {break_duration} minute break!\")\n        if session < sessions:\n            time.sleep(break_seconds)\n    \n    print(\"All sessions completed! Great job!\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    pomodoro_timer()\n```\n\n### How to Use:\n1. **Run the Script**: Save the script as a Python file (e.g., `pomodoro.py`) and run it using a Python interpreter.\n2. **Customize the Durations**: You can adjust the `work_duration`, `break_duration`, and `sessions` parameters to fit your team's schedule. The default setup follows the classic Pomodoro Technique with 25-minute work intervals and 5-minute breaks, repeating for 4 sessions.\n3. **Notifications**: For a more advanced setup, you might want to add desktop notifications or sounds to alert the team when it's time to switch between work and break intervals.\n\nThis script provides a simple command-line interface to help your team get started with the Pomodoro Technique."
