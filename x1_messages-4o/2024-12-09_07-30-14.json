        "content": "Certainly! In Python, understanding the difference between expressions and statements is fundamental to writing and reading code.\n\n### Expressions\nAn **expression** is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to functions that can be evaluated to produce another value. Expressions are pieces of code that return a value. They are the building blocks of statements.\n\n- **Examples of Expressions:**\n  - `2 + 3`\n  - `a * b`\n  - `my_function(x)`\n  - `\"Hello, \" + \"world!\"`\n  - `x > 10`\n\nIn these examples, each expression evaluates to a single value. For instance, `2 + 3` evaluates to `5`, `\"Hello, \" + \"world!\"` evaluates to `\"Hello, world!\"`.\n\n### Statements\nA **statement** is an instruction that the Python interpreter can execute. Statements do not return a value; instead, they perform an action. Statements can be made up of one or more expressions.\n\n- **Examples of Statements:**\n  - Assignment: `x = 5`\n  - Conditional: `if x > 0: print(\"Positive\")`\n  - Loop: `for i in range(10): print(i)`\n  - Function definition: `def my_function(): pass`\n  - Import: `import math`\n\nIn these examples, statements perform actions. An assignment statement (`x = 5`) assigns the value `5` to the variable `x`. A loop statement (`for i in range(10): print(i)`) repeatedly executes the print function.\n\n### Key Differences\n- **Value**: Expressions always result in a value. Statements do not return a value; they perform an action.\n- **Usage**: Expressions can be used as part of statements. Statements control the flow of a program.\n- **Evaluation**: Expressions are evaluated to produce a value. Statements are executed to perform an action.\n\nUnderstanding the distinction between expressions and statements helps in analyzing how code is structured and executed in Python."
