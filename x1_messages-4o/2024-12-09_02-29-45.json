        "content": "The issue with your code is due to the way the expression is evaluated. The expression `' ' in word == True` is equivalent to `(' ' in word) == True`, which means it checks if the result of `' ' in word` is equal to `True`. However, `' ' in word` already returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`), so directly comparing it to `True` is unnecessary.\n\nTo check whether a string is a single word without spaces, you should verify that there are no spaces in the string. You can do this using the `not` operator along with the `in` keyword, like so:\n\n```python\nif ' ' not in word:\n    print(\"The string is a single word without spaces.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The string contains spaces.\")\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `str.split` method to check if the string splits into more than one part:\n\n```python\nif len(word.split()) == 1:\n    print(\"The string is a single word without spaces.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The string contains spaces.\")\n```\n\nBoth approaches will effectively determine if the string is a single word without spaces."
