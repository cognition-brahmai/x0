You have access to the following formula:\ntotalCost = baseCost - discount + surcharge\nYour job is to determine the values of baseCost, discount, and surcharge based on the customer's location and the corresponding pricing tier. \nHere are the pricing tiers and their corresponding rates:\n- Tier 1: $100, discount rate of 10%, surcharge rate of 5%\n- Tier 2: $200, discount rate of 15%, surcharge rate of 7%\n- Tier 3: $300, discount rate of 20%, surcharge rate of 10%\nTo calculate the final cost per item, you must also output a detailed breakdown of the discounts, surcharges, and pricing tiers applied to each item. How can you modify the formula to achieve this?"
