The method I'm using to read the JSON is as follows:\n\n```python\n@app.route('/api/add_message/<uuid>', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef add_message(uuid):\n    content = request.json\n    print(content)\n    return uuid\n```\n\nWhen I run this, the browser correctly returns the UUID I input in the GET, but on the console, it prints out 'None' instead of the expected JSON, {\"text\":\"lalala\"}. How can I correctly get the POSTed JSON from within the Flask method?"

        "content": "To correctly retrieve and print the JSON data sent in a POST request using Flask, you'll want to ensure a couple of things are correctly set up:\n\n1. **Content-Type Header:** Make sure that when you send a POST request from Postman, the `Content-Type` header is set to `application/json`. This is important because Flask uses this to determine how to parse the incoming data.\n\n2. **Accessing JSON Data:** You should be using `request.get_json()` instead of `request.json`. While both can work, `request.get_json()` allows for parameters like `force` or `silent` that can help in debugging.\n\nHere's an updated version of your code with these considerations:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/api/add_message/<uuid>', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef add_message(uuid):\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        content = request.get_json(silent=True)  # Use get_json() method\n        print(content)\n    return uuid\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n- **Silent Mode:** The `silent=True` parameter tells Flask to return `None` if the JSON parsing fails rather than raising an error. This can be useful for debugging.\n- **Debugging Postman:** Double-check that you are actually sending the data as JSON. In Postman, ensure the body of your request is set to \"raw\" and the type is \"JSON (application/json)\".\n- **UUID Handling:** Ensure that the UUID you're passing in the route is correctly formatted when you make the request.\n\nTry these adjustments and see if they resolve the issue. If you continue to experience problems, consider adding some print statements or logging to inspect the incoming request and headers for further insights."
