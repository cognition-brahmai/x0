Two homophonic words that contrast with the word \"light\" could be \"lite\" and \"lyte.\" \n\n1. \"Light\" (as in illumination or not heavy) is pronounced as /la\u026at/.\n   \n2. \"Lite\" (often used as an alternative spelling to indicate something is low in fat or calories) is pronounced as /la\u026at/.\n   \n3. \"Lyte\" (an archaic or stylized spelling, often used in names) is pronounced as /la\u026at/.\n\nWhile \"lite\" and \"lyte\" are not common in everyday language, they serve as homophones with different meanings compared to \"light.\""
