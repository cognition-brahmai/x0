I am trying to test the 'update' method on my viewset which is a ModelViewSet taken from Django Rest Framework (DRF). I need to send a PUT request, but I keep getting a result saying {'detail':'Method POST not allowed.'}. The code I am using to post my data in the testcase is as follows:\n\n```python\nheader = {'X_HTTP_METHOD_OVERRIDE': 'PUT'}\nresponse = client.post('/model/1/', content_type='application/json', data=post_data_clean, **header)\n```\nHowever, this approach isn't working. I tested the server's behavior using a Postman addon where I specified the 'X-HTTP-Method-Override' header and no exception was raised. I need a solution to this issue, otherwise, testing will become very difficult."

        "content": "To correctly pass the `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header to Django's test client, you need to ensure that the header is formatted properly and that Django's test client is able to interpret it correctly. The test client in Django doesn't automatically handle method overriding through headers, so you need to manually set it up in your test case.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. Make sure the header key is correctly formatted. In HTTP headers, dashes (`-`) are used instead of underscores (`_`). So the correct header should be `'X-HTTP-Method-Override'`.\n\n2. When passing headers to Django's test client, they need to be prefixed with `'HTTP_'` to simulate HTTP headers. However, this is not required when you're overriding the method directly.\n\n3. Use the `post` method and include the override header properly.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n```python\n# Correct the header name and ensure the method is correctly overridden\nheader = {'HTTP_X_HTTP_METHOD_OVERRIDE': 'PUT'}\nresponse = client.post('/model/1/', data=post_data_clean, content_type='application/json', **header)\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, notice that the header key is prefixed with `HTTP_`, which is a requirement for Django's test client to treat the dictionary key as an HTTP header.\n\nAdditionally, ensure that your viewset is configured to allow method overriding. This can typically be done by ensuring that your APIView or ViewSet is configured to accept the method you are trying to override.\n\nIf you're still encountering issues, double-check your DRF settings and ensure that any middleware or custom logic isn't interfering with the method override process.\n\nThis should allow your test to simulate a `PUT` request using the `POST` method with the `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header."
