        "content": "The error you're encountering typically indicates that Python cannot find the Django module, even though you've installed it. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Virtual Environment**: It's a good practice to use a virtual environment for your Django project to manage dependencies. If you haven't set one up, you can do so with the following commands:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\\Scripts\\activate`\n   ```\n\n   Then, install Django within this virtual environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install django==1.6.5\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Python Path**: Make sure that the Python interpreter you're using is the one where Django is installed. You can check which Python you're using with:\n\n   ```bash\n   which python  # On Windows use `where python`\n   ```\n\n   Ensure this path matches the Python version where you installed Django.\n\n3. **Reinstall Django**: Sometimes, reinstalling Django can resolve path issues:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall django\n   pip install django==1.6.5\n   ```\n\n4. **Check PYTHONPATH**: Ensure that your `PYTHONPATH` includes the site-packages directory where Django is installed. You can temporarily add it in your terminal session:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/your/site-packages\n   ```\n\n5. **Check for Multiple Python Versions**: If multiple Python versions are installed, ensure that you are using the correct version. If your project is supposed to use Python 2.7, make sure that's the version invoked when you run your commands.\n\n6. **Verify Django Installation**: You can manually check if Django is installed by trying to import it in a Python shell:\n\n   ```bash\n   python\n   >>> import django\n   >>> django.get_version()\n   ```\n\n   This should return the installed version of Django if it's available.\n\n7. **Permissions Issue**: Ensure that there are no permission issues preventing Python from accessing the Django module.\n\nIf you follow these steps and still encounter problems, please provide any additional error messages or context, and I'll be happy to help further."
