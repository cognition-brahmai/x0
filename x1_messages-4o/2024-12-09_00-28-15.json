Here's a one-liner that will do what you need:\n\n```bash\nawk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}' FileWithColumnOfNumbers.txt\n```\n\nThis command works as follows:\n\n- `awk` processes the file line by line.\n- `{sum += $1}` adds the value in the first column (you can change `$1` to another column number if needed) to the variable `sum`.\n- `END {print sum}` outputs the total sum after processing all lines.\n\nIf you want to use it in a pipeline, you can do:\n\n```bash\ncat FileWithColumnOfNumbers.txt | awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}'\n```\n\nThis will read the input from the pipeline and sum the numbers in the first column. Adjust `$1` to match the column you want to sum if it's not the first one."
