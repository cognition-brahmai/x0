I'm attempting this with the following piece of code: \n\n```python\ngroup_by_dataframe.count().filter(\"`count` >= 10\").sort('count', ascending=False)\n```\n\nHowever, I'm encountering an error message that says \"sort() got an unexpected keyword argument 'ascending'\". How can I fix this?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is because the version of PySpark you're using, Spark 1.3.1, does not support the `ascending` keyword argument in the `sort()` method. That feature was introduced in later versions of PySpark. In Spark 1.3.1, you can use the `orderBy()` method to sort your DataFrame. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired result:\n\n```python\ngroup_by_dataframe \\\n    .count() \\\n    .filter(\"`count` >= 10\") \\\n    .orderBy('count', ascending=False)\n```\n\nIn this code, `orderBy()` is used instead of `sort()`, and it accepts the `ascending` parameter to specify the sorting order. This should resolve the error and perform the sorting in descending order based on the `count` column."
