Can you provide an example code snippet using the Latex equation to calculate and compare the speeds? \nHere's the Latex equation for calculating the download and upload speeds: \nDownload speed = $\\frac{\\text{file size}}{\\text{download time}}$\nUpload speed = $\\frac{\\text{file size}}{\\text{upload time}}$\nAnd here's a sample C# code snippet that uses the Latex equation to calculate and compare the speeds:\n```csharp\ndouble fileSize = 1024; // in KB\ndouble downloadTime = 10; // in seconds\ndouble uploadTime = 20; // in seconds\ndouble downloadSpeed = fileSize / downloadTime;\ndouble uploadSpeed = fileSize / uploadTime;\nConsole.WriteLine(\"My download speed is: \" + downloadSpeed + \" KB/s\");\nConsole.WriteLine(\"My upload speed is: \" + uploadSpeed + \" KB/s\");\ndouble neighborDownloadSpeed = 12.5; // in KB/s\ndouble neighborUploadSpeed = 7.8; // in KB/s\nif (downloadSpeed > neighborDownloadSpeed) {\n    Console.WriteLine(\"My download speed is faster than my neighbor's!\");\n} else if (downloadSpeed < neighborDownloadSpeed) {\n    Console.WriteLine(\"My neighbor's download speed is faster than mine!\");\n} else {\n    Console.WriteLine(\"My neighbor and I have the same download speed.\");\n}\nif (uploadSpeed > neighborUploadSpeed) {\n    Console.WriteLine(\"My upload speed is faster than my neighbor's!\");\n} else if (uploadSpeed < neighborUploadSpeed) {\n    Console.WriteLine(\"My neighbor's upload speed is faster than mine!\");\n} else {\n    Console.WriteLine(\"My neighbor and I have the same upload speed.\");\n}\n```"

The actual calculation in C# will follow the logic you've described using the file size and time.\n\nHere's how you can integrate the LaTeX equations as comments in your C# code:\n\n```csharp\n// LaTeX equations for reference:\n// Download speed = \\frac{\\text{file size}}{\\text{download time}}\n// Upload speed = \\frac{\\text{file size}}{\\text{upload time}}\n\ndouble fileSize = 1024; // in KB\ndouble downloadTime = 10; // in seconds\ndouble uploadTime = 20; // in seconds\n\n// Calculate download and upload speeds using the formulas\ndouble downloadSpeed = fileSize / downloadTime; // KB/s\ndouble uploadSpeed = fileSize / uploadTime; // KB/s\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"My download speed is: \" + downloadSpeed + \" KB/s\");\nConsole.WriteLine(\"My upload speed is: \" + uploadSpeed + \" KB/s\");\n\n// Neighbor's speeds for comparison\ndouble neighborDownloadSpeed = 12.5; // in KB/s\ndouble neighborUploadSpeed = 7.8; // in KB/s\n\n// Compare download speeds\nif (downloadSpeed > neighborDownloadSpeed) {\n    Console.WriteLine(\"My download speed is faster than my neighbor's!\");\n} else if (downloadSpeed < neighborDownloadSpeed) {\n    Console.WriteLine(\"My neighbor's download speed is faster than mine!\");\n} else {\n    Console.WriteLine(\"My neighbor and I have the same download speed.\");\n}\n\n// Compare upload speeds\nif (uploadSpeed > neighborUploadSpeed) {\n    Console.WriteLine(\"My upload speed is faster than my neighbor's!\");\n} else if (uploadSpeed < neighborUploadSpeed) {\n    Console.WriteLine(\"My neighbor's upload speed is faster than mine!\");\n} else {\n    Console.WriteLine(\"My neighbor and I have the same upload speed.\");\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, the LaTeX equations are included as comments to help anyone reading the code understand the logic behind the calculations. The actual calculations in C# are straightforward arithmetic operations that use the variables `fileSize`, `downloadTime`, and `uploadTime` to compute the speeds."
