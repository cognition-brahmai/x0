        "content": "I am using an asynchronous API to connect and send mail to an SMTP server which requires some setup and tear down. This fits perfectly into using a `contextmanager` from Python 3's `contextlib`. However, I'm unsure if it's possible to write this because both the API and `contextmanager` use the generator syntax. I've written a piece of code that combines yield-base and async-await syntax to demonstrate the difference between async calls and yields to the context manager. Is this kind of implementation possible in Python and if so, how would I use a `with` `as` statement with it? If not, is there an alternative way I could achieve this, possibly using the old style context manager?\n\nHere is the code I've written:\n\n```python\n@contextmanager\nasync def smtp_connection():\n    client = SMTPAsync()\n\n    try:\n        await client.connect(smtp_url, smtp_port)\n        await client.starttls()\n        await client.login(smtp_username, smtp_password)\n        yield client\n    finally:\n        await client.quit()\n```"

        "content": "In Python, mixing `async` functions with the `contextmanager` decorator from `contextlib` directly won't work because `contextmanager` expects a synchronous generator. However, you can achieve the desired functionality using `asyncio` and `contextlib.asynccontextmanager` which is specifically designed for asynchronous context managers.\n\nHere's how you can implement an asynchronous context manager for your SMTP connection:\n\n```python\nfrom contextlib import asynccontextmanager\nfrom aiosmtplib import SMTP\n\n@asynccontextmanager\nasync def smtp_connection():\n    client = SMTP(hostname=smtp_url, port=smtp_port)\n\n    try:\n        await client.connect()\n        await client.starttls()\n        await client.login(smtp_username, smtp_password)\n        yield client\n    finally:\n        await client.quit()\n\n# Usage example\nasync def send_email():\n    async with smtp_connection() as client:\n        await client.sendmail(\n            \"from@example.com\",\n            [\"to@example.com\"],\n            \"Subject: Test\\n\\nThis is a test email.\"\n        )\n\n# Running the async function\nimport asyncio\nasyncio.run(send_email())\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`asynccontextmanager`**: This decorator is used to define an asynchronous context manager. It allows you to use `async with` syntax, making it compatible with asynchronous code.\n\n- **`yield`**: The `yield` statement is used within the context manager to provide the resource (in this case, the `client`) to the block of code using `async with`.\n\n- **Usage with `async with`**: When you use `async with smtp_connection() as client`, the context manager handles connecting, starting TLS, and logging in before yielding the `client`. Once the block is done, it quits the connection.\n\nThis implementation allows you to manage asynchronous resources in a structured and clean way, leveraging Python's `asyncio` capabilities."
