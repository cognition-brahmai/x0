        "content": "I am new to Python programming and using DynamoDB. I'm trying to run a scan on my table that returns results based on two pre-defined attributes. Here is my Python code snippet:\n\n```python\nshift = \"3rd\"\ndate = \"2017-06-21\"\n\nif shift != \"\":\n    response = table.scan(\n        FilterExpression=Attr(\"Date\").eq(date) and Attr(\"Shift\").eq(shift)\n    )\n```\nMy DynamoDB has 4 fields: ID, Date, Shift, Safety. However, upon running my code, I'm getting two table entries returned when I should only be getting the first entry, the one with \"No safety issues\" based on my scan criteria. Here are my DynamoDB return results:\n\n```python\n[\n  {\n    \"Shift\": \"3rd\",  \n    \"Safety\": \"No safety issues\",  \n    \"Date\": \"2017-06-21\",\n    \"ID\": \"2\"\n  }, \n  {\n    \"Shift\": \"3rd\", \n    \"Safety\": \"Cut Finger\", \n    \"Date\": \"2017-06-22\", \n    \"ID\": \"4\"\n  }\n]\n```\nItems Returned:  2\n\nI believe that by applying the FilterExpression with the logical 'and' specified that the scan operation is looking for entries that meet BOTH criteria since I used 'and'. Could this be because the 'shift' attribute \"3rd\" is found in both entries? How can I ensure that it returns entries based on BOTH criteria being met and not just giving me results from one attribute type? I've looked at the available documentation but am still having trouble. Any help would be greatly appreciated!"

        "content": "Your issue arises from the way you're combining conditions in the `FilterExpression`. In Python, the `and` operator doesn't work the way you might expect when used within a DynamoDB `FilterExpression`. Instead, you should use the `&` operator between the conditions, which is specifically designed to combine conditions in a `FilterExpression`.\n\nHere's how you should structure your `FilterExpression`:\n\n```python\nfrom boto3.dynamodb.conditions import Attr\n\nshift = \"3rd\"\ndate = \"2017-06-21\"\n\nif shift != \"\":\n    response = table.scan(\n        FilterExpression=Attr(\"Date\").eq(date) & Attr(\"Shift\").eq(shift)\n    )\n```\n\nBy using `&` instead of `and`, you're correctly combining the conditions for the `FilterExpression`. This means the scan operation will now correctly filter results based on both the `Date` and `Shift` attributes being equal to the specified values. With this adjustment, you should only receive the entries that meet both criteria, and the unwanted entry with the date \"2017-06-22\" should be excluded from the results."
