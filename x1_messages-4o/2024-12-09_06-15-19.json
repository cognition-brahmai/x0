I am trying to accomplish this in a loop where each iteration generates a numpy array that I wish to append to my main array 'a'. However, instead of ending up with an array of arrays (e.g., [[1,5,3], [9,10,1], ..., [4,8,6]]), I am getting a single merged array (e.g., [1,5,3,9,10,1,... 4,8,6]). How can I achieve my desired result? Also, I don't know the final dimension of the array, so I can't initialize it with a fixed dimension.\n\nHere's my current code:\n\n```python\na=np.array([])\nwhile(...):\n   ...\n   b= //a numpy array generated\n   a=np.append(a,b)\n   ...\n```"

        "content": "To achieve your desired result of creating an array of arrays using NumPy, you should avoid using `np.append` in its default manner, as it flattens the arrays. Instead, you can use a list to accumulate the arrays and then convert it to a NumPy array at the end. Here's how you can modify your code to accomplish this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initialize an empty list to store the arrays\narray_list = []\n\nwhile (...):  # Your condition for the loop\n    ...\n    b = ...  # A numpy array generated in each iteration\n    array_list.append(b)  # Append the numpy array to the list\n    ...\n\n# Convert the list of arrays to a 2D numpy array\na = np.array(array_list)\n\n# Now 'a' is a numpy array of arrays\n```\n\nThis approach uses a Python list to accumulate the arrays and then converts the list to a NumPy array once the loop is complete. This way, you get an array of arrays as you wanted. Keep in mind that all arrays added to the list should have the same shape for `np.array(array_list)` to work properly without errors. If the shapes of arrays differ, consider using an object array or handling the shapes appropriately."
