The second consecutive odd number would then be 2n+3. The sum of these two consecutive odd numbers can be calculated as (2n+1) + (2n+3) = 4n+4. We can simplify this expression as 4(n+1), which is clearly even.\nTherefore, we can conclude that the sum of two consecutive odd numbers is always even."

        "content": "Your explanation is correct, and you've demonstrated it well using algebraic expressions.\n\nTo prove that the sum of two consecutive odd numbers is always even, we can break it down as follows:\n\n1. **Representation of Odd Numbers:**\n   - Any odd number can be represented in the form \\(2n + 1\\), where \\(n\\) is an integer.\n\n2. **Consecutive Odd Numbers:**\n   - If the first odd number is \\(2n + 1\\), the next consecutive odd number would be \\(2n + 3\\).\n\n3. **Sum of Consecutive Odd Numbers:**\n   - The sum of these two numbers is:\n     \\[\n     (2n + 1) + (2n + 3) = 4n + 4\n     \\]\n\n4. **Simplification:**\n   - Simplifying \\(4n + 4\\), we get:\n     \\[\n     4(n + 1)\n     \\]\n   - Since \\(4(n + 1)\\) is clearly a multiple of 4, it is even.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Therefore, the sum of two consecutive odd numbers, represented as \\(4(n + 1)\\), is always even.\n\nThis proof relies on the fact that any number that can be expressed as a multiple of 2 (or any multiple of an even number, like 4 in this case) is even. Hence, your conclusion that the sum of two consecutive odd numbers is always even is mathematically sound."
