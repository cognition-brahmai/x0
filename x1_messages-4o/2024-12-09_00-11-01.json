        "content": "To categorize the given objects into two distinct groups based on their functionalities in Scala, you have correctly identified \"Mouse,\" \"keyboard,\" and \"screen\" as functional objects because they primarily serve as input and output devices essential for interacting with a computer system. The \"printer,\" on the other hand, is considered a non-functional object in this context because it serves as a peripheral device for producing hard copies of digital documents and is not directly involved in the user-computer interaction process.\n\nHere's the Scala code that demonstrates this categorization:\n\n```scala\nval inputObjects = List(\"Mouse\", \"keyboard\", \"printer\", \"screen\")\nval functionalObjects = List(\"Mouse\", \"keyboard\", \"screen\")\nval nonFunctionalObjects = inputObjects diff functionalObjects\n\nprintln(s\"Functional Objects: $functionalObjects\")\nprintln(s\"Non-Functional Objects: $nonFunctionalObjects\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **Functional Objects:** These include \"Mouse,\" \"keyboard,\" and \"screen,\" which are directly involved in computer input and output operations. The mouse and keyboard are used to input data and commands, while the screen is used to display output.\n\n- **Non-Functional Objects:** The \"printer\" is classified here because it is typically used to produce physical copies of data, which is a separate function from the immediate input/output interactions facilitated by the other devices.\n\nThis categorization helps in understanding the roles of different peripherals in computing environments, distinguishing between those that are essential for direct interaction and those that serve auxiliary functions."
