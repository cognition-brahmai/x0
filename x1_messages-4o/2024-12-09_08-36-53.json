Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nprint(\"\\u2713\")\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `chr()` function with the Unicode code point:\n\n```python\nprint(chr(0x2713))\n```\n\nBoth of these methods will output the check mark character \"\u2713\". Make sure your environment supports Unicode, which most modern environments do."
