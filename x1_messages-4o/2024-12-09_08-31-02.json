Additionally, there should be a blank line between each group of imports. Is there a way to check if this standard is violated anywhere in my Python package using static code analysis tools like pylint, pyflakes, pychecker, pep8? \n\nFor instance, if I have the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom my_package import my_module\nfrom django.db import models\nimport os\n```\n\nThis violates the PEP8 standard. The correct way to import should be:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nfrom django.db import models\n\nfrom my_package import my_module\n```\n\nIs there a tool that can help me check this?"

        "content": "Yes, there are several static code analysis tools that can help you check if your imports follow PEP8 standards, particularly the ordering of imports. Here are a few tools that can help:\n\n1. **isort**: This is a Python utility that sorts imports alphabetically and automatically separates them into sections and by type. It can be used to both check and fix import order issues. You can install it via pip and use it in your project:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install isort\n   ```\n\n   To check for import order issues, you can run:\n\n   ```bash\n   isort --check-only your_file.py\n   ```\n\n   To automatically fix the import order, use:\n\n   ```bash\n   isort your_file.py\n   ```\n\n2. **flake8 with flake8-import-order**: This is a combination of tools where `flake8` is a popular linting tool, and `flake8-import-order` is a plugin specifically for checking the import order.\n\n   First, install them:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install flake8 flake8-import-order\n   ```\n\n   Then, run flake8 on your codebase:\n\n   ```bash\n   flake8 your_file.py\n   ```\n\n   This will report import order issues among other PEP8 violations.\n\n3. **pylint**: While `pylint` is primarily used for catching coding errors, enforcing a coding standard, and looking for code smells, it can also verify import order. The configuration might not be as straightforward as `isort`, but it can still be configured to catch such issues.\n\n   Install pylint:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pylint\n   ```\n\n   Run pylint:\n\n   ```bash\n   pylint your_file.py\n   ```\n\nFor your specific example, using `isort` would be the most straightforward way to automatically fix the import order and ensure compliance with PEP8 standards."
