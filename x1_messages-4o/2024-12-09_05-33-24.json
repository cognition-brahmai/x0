        "content": "Unused imports in a Python script do not directly affect the runtime performance of the script in a significant way. However, they can have some indirect impacts:\n\n1. **Memory Usage**: Each import may consume a small amount of memory. If there are many unused imports, it could slightly increase the memory footprint of the program.\n\n2. **Startup Time**: During the initial loading of the script, the interpreter processes all the imports. Having numerous unnecessary imports can slightly increase the startup time, especially if the modules being imported are large or have complex dependencies.\n\n3. **Code Readability and Maintainability**: Unused imports can clutter the code, making it harder for others (or yourself) to read and maintain. It may lead to confusion about what is actually being used in the script.\n\n4. **Linting and Code Quality**: Many code quality tools and linters will flag unused imports as issues, which can hinder the process of maintaining clean, efficient, and professional code.\n\nWhile the performance impact is minimal, it's generally a good practice to remove unused imports to keep the codebase clean and efficient."
