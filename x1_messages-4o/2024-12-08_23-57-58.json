The song must incorporate a minimum of four different chord progressions, with at least one of them containing a minor 7th chord. Additionally, the lyrics of the song should touch upon the themes of heartbreak, loss, and redemption. To make the song more complex, include a bridge section that modulates to a different key and utilizes a jazz-inspired chord progression. The song should be written in standard music notation using the key of your choice."

Each section is designed to evoke emotion and carry the listener on a journey through the blues and beyond."
