        "content": "In the newer versions of CUDA, the `--multicore` option you mentioned is no longer available. Instead, NVIDIA has shifted focus towards using CUDA's support for emulation or alternative platforms to run CUDA applications on systems without a compatible NVIDIA GPU.\n\nHere are a few options that might help you run CUDA code on your CPU:\n\n1. **CUDA Emulation Mode**: In older versions, CUDA had an emulation mode, but this has been deprecated. However, you might still find some utilities or third-party tools that offer similar capabilities by translating CUDA code to something executable on a CPU.\n\n2. **OpenCL**: If you're looking to run parallel computations on a CPU, OpenCL might be a viable alternative. It is designed for heterogeneous platforms including CPUs.\n\n3. **GPU Simulators**: Tools like GPGPU-Sim or Multi2Sim allow you to simulate a GPU on a CPU, which can be useful for development and testing, albeit with performance limitations.\n\n4. **OpenACC**: If your code can be written in a way that abstracts away from CUDA specifics, OpenACC might allow you to write code that can execute on CPUs and GPUs with minimal changes.\n\n5. **CUDA on WSL 2**: If you are using Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL 2), you can use CUDA on it, provided you have access to a compatible NVIDIA GPU on the Windows side.\n\n6. **Using Cloud Services**: If possible, you could use cloud services like AWS EC2 instances with NVIDIA GPUs for development and testing.\n\nIt's important to note that while these options can help, they may not fully replicate the performance or behavior of running code directly on an NVIDIA GPU."
