My current script reads in a text file that contains code which has been converted into tokens and spellings. It then reconstructs the code into a string, with blank lines where comments would have been in the original code. I want to have two script files, one that contains a class and function that cleans and reconstructs the file. The second script would simply call the function from the class in the other file on a file given as an argument from the command line."

        "content": "To restructure your Python script into an object-oriented design and split it into multiple modules, you can follow these steps. This approach will create a cleaner, more maintainable codebase by separating concerns into different files and using classes to encapsulate functionality.\n\n### Step-by-step Guide:\n\n1. **Create a Class for Processing the File:**\n\n   Create a module, say `file_processor.py`, which will contain a class responsible for reading, cleaning, and reconstructing the file. This class can have methods for each of these tasks.\n\n   ```python\n   # file_processor.py\n\n   class FileProcessor:\n       def __init__(self, filepath):\n           self.filepath = filepath\n           self.tokens = []\n\n       def read_file(self):\n           with open(self.filepath, 'r') as file:\n               self.tokens = file.readlines()\n\n       def clean_and_reconstruct(self):\n           reconstructed_code = []\n           for token in self.tokens:\n               # Assuming tokens are separated by some delimiter\n               parts = token.split()  # Split based on whitespace or another delimiter\n               # Assuming that the second part is the spelling\n               spelling = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n               if spelling.startswith('#'):\n                   # Add a blank line for comments\n                   reconstructed_code.append('')\n               else:\n                   reconstructed_code.append(spelling)\n\n           return '\\n'.join(reconstructed_code)\n\n       def process(self):\n           self.read_file()\n           return self.clean_and_reconstruct()\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a Script to Use the Class:**\n\n   Create another module, say `main.py`, which will use the `FileProcessor` class to process a file provided via command-line argument.\n\n   ```python\n   # main.py\n\n   import sys\n   from file_processor import FileProcessor\n\n   def main():\n       if len(sys.argv) != 2:\n           print(\"Usage: python main.py <file_path>\")\n           sys.exit(1)\n\n       file_path = sys.argv[1]\n\n       processor = FileProcessor(file_path)\n       reconstructed_code = processor.process()\n\n       print(\"Reconstructed Code:\")\n       print(reconstructed_code)\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       main()\n   ```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`file_processor.py`:** This file contains the `FileProcessor` class, which is responsible for handling the file operations. It initializes with a file path, reads the file, processes the tokens, and reconstructs the code.\n\n2. **`main.py`:** This script handles the command-line interface. It checks for the correct number of arguments and uses the `FileProcessor` class to process the file and print the reconstructed code.\n\n### Usage:\n\nTo use this setup, run the `main.py` script from the command line, passing the path to your tokenized file as an argument:\n\n```bash\npython main.py /path/to/your/tokenized_file.txt\n```\n\nThis approach allows you to separate the logic of file processing from the execution logic, making your codebase more modular and easier to maintain or extend in the future."
