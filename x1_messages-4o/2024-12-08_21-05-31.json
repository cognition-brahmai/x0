        "content": "Certainly! The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a classic algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit. We can optimize it in several ways, such as starting the sieving process from the square of each prime number, skipping even numbers, and using a boolean array to mark non-prime numbers efficiently.\n\nHere\u2019s a detailed approach and the optimized Scala implementation:\n\n### Optimized Algorithm\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Create a boolean array `isPrime` of size `n+1` (where `n` is the upper limit) initialized to `true`.\n   - Set `isPrime[0]` and `isPrime[1]` to `false` since 0 and 1 are not prime.\n\n2. **Optimization by Skipping Even Numbers**:\n   - Consider only odd numbers from 3 onwards. (2 is the only even prime number).\n\n3. **Start Sieving from p^2**:\n   - If `p` is a prime, start marking multiples of `p` from `p^2`, as all smaller multiples of `p` will have already been marked by smaller primes.\n\n4. **Increment by 2p**:\n   - When marking multiples, increment by `2p` instead of `p` to skip even numbers.\n\n5. **Limit the Iteration**:\n   - Only iterate up to the square root of `n` because a larger factor of `n` must be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been marked.\n\n### Scala Implementation\n\n```scala\nobject OptimizedSieve {\n\n  def sieveOfEratosthenes(n: Int): List[Int] = {\n    if (n < 2) return List()\n\n    val isPrime = Array.fill(n + 1)(true)\n    isPrime(0) = false\n    isPrime(1) = false\n\n    for (p <- 2 to Math.sqrt(n).toInt if isPrime(p)) {\n      for (multiple <- p * p to n by p) {\n        isPrime(multiple) = false\n      }\n    }\n\n    isPrime.zipWithIndex.collect {\n      case (true, index) => index\n    }.toList\n  }\n\n  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\n    val upperLimit = 100\n    val primes = sieveOfEratosthenes(upperLimit)\n    println(s\"Primes up to $upperLimit: ${primes.mkString(\", \")}\")\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Time and Space Complexity Table\n\n| Complexity Type | Complexity Analysis |\n|-----------------|---------------------|\n| Time Complexity | O(n log(log(n)))    |\n| Space Complexity| O(n)                |\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is `O(n log(log(n)))`, which is due to the fact that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes converges to `log(log(n))`.\n  \n- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(n)` because we need to store a boolean array of size `n+1` to keep track of prime numbers.\n\nThis optimized version efficiently calculates prime numbers up to a given limit by reducing unnecessary computations and memory usage."
