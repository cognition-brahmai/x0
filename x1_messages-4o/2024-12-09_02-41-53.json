        "content": "To implement a `next_batch` function similar to the one found in the TensorFlow MNIST tutorial for your own data in a NumPy array, you'll need to define a function that selects a random subset of your data each time it's called. Here\u2019s how you can proceed:\n\n1. **Define the Function**: Create a function that takes in your data and the desired batch size and returns a random batch of data.\n\n2. **Shuffle the Data**: It's generally a good idea to shuffle your data at the start of each epoch to ensure that your model doesn't learn any unintended order dependencies.\n\n3. **Keep Track of the Current Index**: Maintain an index to track where you are in the dataset, so that you can iterate over the entire dataset in batches.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple implementation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nclass DataSet:\n    def __init__(self, X, Y):\n        self.X = X\n        self.Y = Y\n        self.num_examples = X.shape[0]\n        self.index_in_epoch = 0\n        self.epochs_completed = 0\n        self.permutation = np.arange(self.num_examples)\n        np.random.shuffle(self.permutation)\n\n    def next_batch(self, batch_size):\n        start = self.index_in_epoch\n        self.index_in_epoch += batch_size\n\n        if self.index_in_epoch > self.num_examples:\n            # Finished epoch\n            self.epochs_completed += 1\n            # Shuffle the data\n            np.random.shuffle(self.permutation)\n            # Start next epoch\n            start = 0\n            self.index_in_epoch = batch_size\n            assert batch_size <= self.num_examples\n\n        end = self.index_in_epoch\n        batch_indices = self.permutation[start:end]\n        return self.X[batch_indices], self.Y[batch_indices]\n\n# Usage:\nXtr, Ytr = loadData()  # Assuming loadData returns numpy arrays\ntrain_data = DataSet(Xtr, Ytr)\n\nfor it in range(1000):\n    batch_x, batch_y = train_data.next_batch(100)\n    # Use batch_x and batch_y for training\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **DataSet Class**: This class holds your data and provides the `next_batch` method. It initializes with the data and shuffles the indices at the start.\n- **next_batch Method**: This method returns a batch of data and automatically shuffles the data once all the data has been used (i.e., at the end of an epoch).\n- **Shuffling**: The data is shuffled at the beginning of each epoch to ensure randomness.\n\nYou can adjust the `next_batch` method to fit your specific needs, such as handling multiple epochs or different data augmentation strategies."
