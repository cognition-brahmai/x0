        "content": "I am trying to understand how the condensed distance matrix works. I am using scipy.spatial.distance.pdist which returns a condensed distance matrix. The documentation mentions that it returns a condensed distance matrix Y. For each 'i' and 'j' (where i<j), the metric dist(u=X[i], v=X[j]) is computed and stored in entry ij. I initially thought that 'ij' meant 'i*j'. However, I think I might be wrong. Consider the following code:\n\n```python\nX = array([[1,2], [1,2], [3,4]])\ndist_matrix = pdist(X)\n```\n\nAccording to the documentation, dist(X[0], X[2]) should be dist_matrix[0*2]. But, dist_matrix[0*2] is 0, not 2.8 as expected. Can you please explain the correct formula to use to access the similarity of two vectors, given 'i' and 'j'?"

        "content": "Certainly! The confusion arises from the misunderstanding of how the indices work in the condensed distance matrix returned by `scipy.spatial.distance.pdist`. The condensed distance matrix is a 1D array that stores the upper triangular part of the pairwise distance matrix (excluding the diagonal) in a compact form.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Condensed Distance Matrix**: In a condensed distance matrix, the distances are stored in a flat array without redundancies (which would be present in a square distance matrix).\n\n2. **Index Calculation**: To calculate the index of the distance between points `X[i]` and `X[j]` (where `i < j`) in the condensed distance matrix, you use the following formula:\n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{n \\cdot i - \\frac{i \\cdot (i + 1)}{2} + (j - 1 - i)}\n   \\]\n   where \\( n \\) is the number of points.\n\n3. **Understanding the Formula**: \n   - This formula effectively skips all previous rows in the triangular matrix to reach the correct position for the pair `(i, j)`.\n   - The term \\(\\frac{i \\cdot (i + 1)}{2}\\) accounts for the number of elements in the previous rows.\n\n4. **Example**: For your case with `X = array([[1, 2], [1, 2], [3, 4]])`, and you want the distance between `X[0]` and `X[2]`:\n   - Number of points \\( n = 3 \\).\n   - Use the formula to find the index for `(0, 2)`:\n     \\[\n     k = \\frac{3 \\cdot 0 - \\frac{0 \\cdot (0 + 1)}{2} + (2 - 1 - 0)} = 1\n     \\]\n   - So, the distance between `X[0]` and `X[2]` is stored at index `1` in the condensed distance matrix.\n\nTo sum up, the index in the condensed distance matrix for the pair `(i, j)` can be found using the mentioned formula, not by simply multiplying `i` and `j`. This ensures you are accessing the correct distance between two points in your dataset."
