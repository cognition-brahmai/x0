        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to the fact that `tqdm_notebook` is trying to use Jupyter widgets for displaying progress bars, but it requires the `ipywidgets` package to be installed and properly configured in your Jupyter notebook environment.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Update Jupyter and ipywidgets**:\n   Make sure you have the latest versions of Jupyter and `ipywidgets` installed. You can update them using the following commands:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade jupyter\n   pip install --upgrade ipywidgets\n   ```\n\n2. **Enable ipywidgets extension**:\n   After installing or updating `ipywidgets`, you need to enable the extension for Jupyter notebooks. Run the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension\n   ```\n\n3. **Restart the Jupyter Notebook**:\n   After updating and enabling the extension, restart your Jupyter notebook server to ensure that the changes take effect.\n\n4. **Correct Syntax Error**:\n   It looks like there's a syntax error in your code. The `range()` function is not properly closed and there's a missing closing parenthesis for the `tqdm_notebook` function. Here\u2019s the corrected code:\n\n   ```python\n   import tqdm\n\n   for i in tqdm.tqdm_notebook(range(2, int(total_number) // 20)):\n       i\n   ```\n\nAfter following these steps, try running your code again. If you continue to experience issues, consider switching to `tqdm`'s `notebook` module directly using:\n\n```python\nfrom tqdm.notebook import tqdm\n\nfor i in tqdm(range(2, int(total_number) // 20)):\n    i\n```\n\nThis approach is more straightforward and avoids potential confusion with deprecated or alternative functions."
