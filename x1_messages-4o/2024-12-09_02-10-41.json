I've already tried reinstalling both dotenv and python-dotenv but the error persists. I can confirm that the .env file is in the same directory as this script. Here is the script I'm trying to run:\n\n```python\n#bot.py\nimport os\nimport discord\n\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nload_dotenv()\n\ntoken=os.getenv('DISCORD_TOKEN')\n\nclient = discord.Client()\n\n@client.event\nasync def on_ready():\n    print(f'{client.user} has connected to Discord!')\n\nclient.run(token)\n```\n\nWhat could be the cause of this issue and how can I resolve it?"

        "content": "The error message \"no module named 'dotenv'\" indicates that Python cannot find the `dotenv` module, which is part of the `python-dotenv` package. Here are a few troubleshooting steps to help you resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify the Installation:**\n   Make sure that `python-dotenv` is installed in the correct Python environment. You can check if it's installed by running:\n   ```bash\n   pip show python-dotenv\n   ```\n   This should display information about the package if it's installed. If it doesn't, you need to install it.\n\n2. **Install `python-dotenv`:**\n   If it's not installed, or if you're not sure, you can install it using:\n   ```bash\n   pip install python-dotenv\n   ```\n   Ensure you run this command in the environment where your script is executed.\n\n3. **Check Python Environment:**\n   Make sure you're using the correct Python environment. If you have multiple versions of Python installed, ensure you're installing `python-dotenv` in the same environment where you're running your script. You can also use:\n   ```bash\n   python3.8 -m pip install python-dotenv\n   ```\n   to specify the version explicitly.\n\n4. **Virtual Environment:**\n   If you're using a virtual environment, ensure it is activated before you run your script or install packages:\n   ```bash\n   source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux\n   venv\\Scripts\\activate      # On Windows\n   ```\n\n5. **Check for Typos:**\n   Double-check your imports and make sure there are no typos. The import statement should be:\n   ```python\n   from dotenv import load_dotenv\n   ```\n\n6. **Python Path Issues:**\n   If you're using an IDE, ensure it's configured to use the correct Python interpreter. Sometimes IDE settings might point to a different interpreter.\n\n7. **Reinstall `python-dotenv`:**\n   If all else fails, you can try uninstalling and reinstalling `python-dotenv`:\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall python-dotenv\n   pip install python-dotenv\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the \"no module named 'dotenv'\" error. Once resolved, your script should correctly load the environment variables from your `.env` file."
