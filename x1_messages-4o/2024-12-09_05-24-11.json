I would like this new column to be added to the right of the 'Value' column and use the same 'Date' index. Also, I want to rename this calculated moving average column to 'MA'.\n\nHere's the data I have and the Moving Average I calculated:\n\n```python\nExchange = Quandl.get(\"BUNDESBANK/BBEX3_D_SEK_USD_CA_AC_000\",\n                      authtoken=\"xxxxxxx\")\n#               Value\n# Date               \n# 1989-01-02  6.10500\n# 1989-01-03  6.07500\n# 1989-01-04  6.10750\n# 1989-01-05  6.15250\n# 1989-01-09  6.25500\n# 1989-01-10  6.24250\n# 1989-01-11  6.26250\n# 1989-01-12  6.23250\n# 1989-01-13  6.27750\n# 1989-01-16  6.31250\nMovingAverage = pd.rolling_mean(Exchange,5)\n\n#               Value\n# Date          \n# 1989-01-02      NaN\n# 1989-01-03      NaN\n# 1989-01-04      NaN\n# 1989-01-05      NaN\n# 1989-01-09  6.13900\n# 1989-01-10  6.16650\n# 1989-01-11  6.20400\n# 1989-01-12  6.22900\n# 1989-01-13  6.25400\n# 1989-01-16  6.26550\n```"

        "content": "To add the moving average as a new column to your existing DataFrame, you can use the `pd.DataFrame.assign()` method or simply add the new column directly. Note that `pd.rolling_mean()` is deprecated, so it's recommended to use `DataFrame.rolling().mean()` instead.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport Quandl\n\n# Assuming 'Exchange' is already defined as in your example\nExchange = Quandl.get(\"BUNDESBANK/BBEX3_D_SEK_USD_CA_AC_000\", authtoken=\"xxxxxxx\")\n\n# Calculate the moving average\nExchange['MA'] = Exchange['Value'].rolling(window=5).mean()\n\n# Your DataFrame now has a new 'MA' column with the moving average\nprint(Exchange)\n```\n\nThis code will add a new column called 'MA' right next to your 'Value' column, containing the moving averages calculated over a window of 5. The `rolling(window=5).mean()` function calculates the moving average and handles the alignment with the index automatically, maintaining the 'Date' index."
