I am running Django version 1.9.7 and Python version 2.7.6. The Debug Toolbar is included in my installed middleware and applications. Can anyone help me resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering with the Django Debug Toolbar seems to be related to an incompatibility or a bug in the middleware that is being used to process SQL queries. Here\u2019s a step-by-step approach to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Debug Toolbar Version**: Ensure that you are using a version of the Django Debug Toolbar that is compatible with Django 1.9.7. There might be newer versions that have fixed bugs or incompatibilities.\n\n2. **Middleware Configuration**: Double-check the configuration of your middleware in `settings.py`. Make sure the order of middleware is correct and that the `DebugToolbarMiddleware` is properly listed. It should typically be placed towards the top of the list to ensure it wraps around other middleware correctly.\n\n3. **SQL Panel Compatibility**: The error `process() takes exactly 3 arguments (2 given)` suggests a method signature mismatch. This could be due to a custom SQL panel or a specific version of the SQL panel that might not be compatible with Django 1.9.7. Try disabling the SQL panel temporarily to see if this resolves the issue. You can do this by modifying the `DEBUG_TOOLBAR_PANELS` setting to exclude the SQL panel.\n\n4. **Upgrade Python**: If possible, consider upgrading your Python version. Python 2.7.6 is quite old and might have compatibility issues with certain libraries. Upgrading to Python 3.x would also be beneficial for security and performance improvements.\n\n5. **Review Release Notes**: Check the release notes or changelog of Django Debug Toolbar around the version you are using. There might be known issues or patches related to your problem.\n\n6. **Custom SQL Queries**: If you have custom SQL queries or database operations, make sure that these are not interfering with the Debug Toolbar. Sometimes raw SQL can cause unexpected behavior in the toolbar.\n\n7. **Logging and Debugging**: Enable additional logging to see if there are any other errors being thrown that might give more context to what is causing the issue. You can also try running the development server with increased verbosity to catch more details.\n\n8. **Community Support**: If the above steps do not resolve the issue, consider reaching out to the Django community or forums for more specific advice, as others may have encountered and solved similar issues.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the problem with the Django Debug Toolbar."
