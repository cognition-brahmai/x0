        "content": "If you are encountering an error with Pyreverse stating that Graphviz is not installed, despite having installed it, here are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify Graphviz Installation:**\n   - Ensure that Graphviz is correctly installed on your system. You can verify this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\n     ```\n     dot -V\n     ```\n   - This command should return the version of Graphviz that is installed. If it does not, you may need to reinstall Graphviz.\n\n2. **Check Environment Path:**\n   - Make sure that the Graphviz binaries are included in your system's PATH environment variable. This allows Pyreverse to locate and use the Graphviz executables.\n   - For Windows:\n     - Go to 'System Properties' > 'Environment Variables'.\n     - Under 'System variables', find the 'Path' variable, and ensure that the path to the Graphviz `bin` directory (e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\Graphviz\\bin`) is included.\n   - For MacOS/Linux:\n     - Open a terminal and add the Graphviz binary path to your PATH variable by adding the following line to your `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zshrc` file:\n       ```bash\n       export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin\n       ```\n     - Replace `/usr/local/bin` with the actual path to your Graphviz installation if it's different.\n\n3. **Reinstall Graphviz via Package Manager:**\n   - If Graphviz is not found in your PATH, consider reinstalling it using a package manager, which usually handles path settings automatically.\n   - For Windows, you can use the installer from the official [Graphviz website](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/).\n   - For MacOS, use Homebrew:\n     ```bash\n     brew install graphviz\n     ```\n   - For Linux, use your distribution\u2019s package manager, for example, on Ubuntu:\n     ```bash\n     sudo apt-get install graphviz\n     ```\n\n4. **Reinstall Pyreverse:**\n   - If the above steps do not resolve the issue, try reinstalling Pyreverse (usually part of the `pylint` package):\n     ```bash\n     pip install --upgrade pylint\n     ```\n\n5. **Using Pyreverse:**\n   - Once Graphviz is properly installed and configured, you can run Pyreverse with the desired output format:\n     ```bash\n     pyreverse -o png -p <project_name> <your_python_files_or_directory>\n     ```\n   - Ensure that you have permission to write to the directory where you are trying to save the output.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully generate PNG outputs using Pyreverse."
