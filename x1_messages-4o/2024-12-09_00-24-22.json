I have already downloaded the Python extension for VS Code. Am I missing something?"

        "content": "Switching from PyCharm to Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a common choice among developers due to its versatility and extensive extension ecosystem. While VS Code does not have a built-in DataFrame viewer like PyCharm, you can achieve similar functionality with the right setup. Here's how you can view pandas DataFrames in a tabular format during debugging:\n\n1. **Jupyter Extension**: Install the Jupyter extension in VS Code. This extension allows you to run Jupyter notebooks and scripts interactively within VS Code, which can be helpful for exploring DataFrames.\n\n2. **Interactive Window**: Use the Interactive Window feature in VS Code. You can send lines of code to an interactive Python session where you can use Jupyter-like commands to view DataFrames. You can open the Interactive Window by selecting \"Python: Show Interactive Window\" from the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).\n\n3. **Data Viewer**: With the Jupyter extension installed, you can use the Data Viewer feature. When you have a DataFrame variable in your code, you can click on the variable in the Variables panel during debugging. If the Data Viewer is available, a small icon (a grid or table) will appear next to the variable, allowing you to open it in a tabular format.\n\n4. **Pandas GUI Libraries**: Consider using external libraries like `pandasgui` or `qgrid` for more advanced DataFrame viewing. You can install these via pip and integrate them into your workflow:\n   - `pandasgui`: `pip install pandasgui`\n   - `qgrid`: `pip install qgrid`\n\n   You can then use these libraries to create a GUI viewer for your DataFrames within your scripts.\n\n5. **Visual Studio Code Extensions**: Besides the Jupyter extension, there are other extensions that can enhance your experience:\n   - **Python Data Viewer**: This extension provides a simple interface to view DataFrames in a grid format.\n\n6. **Custom Scripts**: As a workaround, you can write custom scripts that export DataFrames to CSV or Excel files, which can then be opened in external viewers like Excel or any spreadsheet application.\n\nBy setting up these tools and extensions, you should be able to view and interact with pandas DataFrames in a manner similar to what you were used to in PyCharm."
