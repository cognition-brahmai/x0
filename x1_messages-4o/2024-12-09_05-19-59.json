I have achieved this by using the following code:\n\n```python\n#gets the string \nstring = input('Input numbers: ') \n#converts the string into an array of int, excluding the whitespaces\narray = [int(s) for s in string.split()] \n```\nThis seems to work as when I input '1 2 3' and print the array, I get '[1, 2, 3]'. However, my goal is to print this list in a single line without the brackets, and with a space in between the numbers, like this: '1 2 3'. I tried achieving this by using the following code:\n\n```python\nfor i in array:\n    print(array[i], end=\" \")\n```\n\nBut I encountered an \"IndexError: list index out of range\" error. How can I print the list of integers in a single line, and without the brackets and commas?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering happens because you're using the list elements as indices in your loop, which leads to an `IndexError` when the element's value exceeds the list's indices. Instead, you should directly print the elements of the list. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve your goal:\n\n```python\n# Get the string input\nstring = input('Input numbers: ')\n\n# Convert the string into a list of integers\narray = [int(s) for s in string.split()]\n\n# Print the elements of the list in a single line, separated by spaces\nprint(' '.join(map(str, array)))\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `map(str, array)`: This converts each integer in the list to a string.\n- `' '.join(...)`: This joins all the string elements with a space in between them, producing a single string that you can print. \n\nThis code should give you the desired output where the numbers are printed in a single line, separated by spaces, without any brackets or commas."
