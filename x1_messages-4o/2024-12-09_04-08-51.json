I have two lists as demonstrated below:\n\n```python\nmylist1 = [[\"lemon\", 0.1], [\"egg\", 0.1], [\"muffin\", 0.3], [\"chocolate\", 0.5]]\nmylist2 = [[\"chocolate\", 0.5], [\"milk\", 0.2], [\"carrot\", 0.8], [\"egg\", 0.8]]\n```\n\nI am aiming to obtain an output as shown below:\n\n```python\nmyoutput = [[\"chocolate\", 0.5], [\"egg\", 0.45]]\n```\n\nMy current approach is as follows, but the complexity is O(n^2) due to the two `for` loops. It works, but it's very inefficient for very long lists:\n\n```python\nfor item1 in mylist1:\n    for item2 in mylist2:\n        if item1[0] == item2[0]:\n             print(np.mean([item1[1], item2[1]]))\n```\n\nI am wondering if there is a more efficient way to achieve this in Python."

        "content": "To compute the mean of the common elements in two lists of lists more efficiently, you can utilize a dictionary to store the elements and their corresponding values. This approach reduces the time complexity to O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the two lists, respectively, by only traversing each list once.\n\nHere's a more efficient solution:\n\n```python\nmylist1 = [[\"lemon\", 0.1], [\"egg\", 0.1], [\"muffin\", 0.3], [\"chocolate\", 0.5]]\nmylist2 = [[\"chocolate\", 0.5], [\"milk\", 0.2], [\"carrot\", 0.8], [\"egg\", 0.8]]\n\n# Create a dictionary for the first list\ndict1 = {item[0]: item[1] for item in mylist1}\n\n# Iterate through the second list and compute the means for common elements\nmyoutput = []\nfor item in mylist2:\n    if item[0] in dict1:\n        # Calculate the mean\n        mean_value = (dict1[item[0]] + item[1]) / 2\n        # Append to output list\n        myoutput.append([item[0], mean_value])\n\nprint(myoutput)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Dictionary Creation**: We first create a dictionary `dict1` from `mylist1`, where the keys are the item names (e.g., \"lemon\", \"egg\") and the values are the corresponding numerical values.\n\n2. **Single Loop**: We then iterate through `mylist2` only once. For each item, we check if the name is a key in `dict1`. If it is, we calculate the mean of the two values and append the result to `myoutput`.\n\nThis approach drastically reduces the number of comparisons needed, as dictionary lookups are average O(1) operations."
