        "content": "Creating a simple web interface to run your Python script can be done efficiently using lightweight frameworks that don't require you to install heavy server modules like `mod_python` or `mod_wsgi`. Here are a few alternatives that you might find suitable:\n\n1. **Flask**: Flask is a lightweight Python web framework that's easy to set up and use. You can create a simple web server to handle requests and execute your script. Here's a basic example:\n\n   ```python\n   from flask import Flask, request\n   import subprocess\n\n   app = Flask(__name__)\n\n   @app.route('/run-script', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\n   def run_script():\n       # Execute your Python script here\n       result = subprocess.run(['python3', 'path/to/your_script.py'], capture_output=True, text=True)\n       return result.stdout\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       app.run(debug=True)\n   ```\n\n   You can run this script, and it will start a web server on your local machine. You can then access it via a web browser to trigger your Python script.\n\n2. **Django**: If you\u2019re looking for something more robust and are planning to expand the web interface features in future, Django could be a good choice. It might be overkill for a simple script execution but provides a lot of built-in functionalities.\n\n3. **FastAPI**: Similar to Flask but more modern and designed to create APIs quickly. It's also asynchronous and very performant.\n\n   ```python\n   from fastapi import FastAPI\n   import subprocess\n\n   app = FastAPI()\n\n   @app.get(\"/run-script\")\n   async def run_script():\n       result = subprocess.run(['python3', 'path/to/your_script.py'], capture_output=True, text=True)\n       return {\"output\": result.stdout}\n\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       import uvicorn\n       uvicorn.run(app, host=\"127.0.0.1\", port=8000)\n   ```\n\n4. **HTTP Server + CGI**: You can use Python's built-in HTTP server with CGI capabilities. This is a very simple way to serve web requests, but it's not as flexible as using a framework like Flask or FastAPI.\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m http.server --cgi 8000\n   ```\n\n   Then, place your script in a `cgi-bin` folder and make sure it starts with the shebang `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.\n\nUsing any of these methods, you'll be able to create a local web interface to execute your Python script without having to rely on PHP or additional server modules. Each option has its pros and cons, so you can choose based on your specific needs and future scalability considerations."
