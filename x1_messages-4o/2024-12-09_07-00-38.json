        "content": "Django is quite modular, and it is indeed possible to use only its Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) component without utilizing the entire framework. The ORM is one of Django's most powerful features, allowing you to interact with your database using Python classes and objects. This modularity means you can use the ORM to map your database tables to Python classes and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations without using other parts of Django like the templating engine or views.\n\nTo use Django's ORM as a standalone component, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install Django**: You need to have Django installed as it contains the ORM.\n\n2. **Configure Settings**: Create a minimal Django settings file that includes your database configuration. This file should specify the database engine and connection details.\n\n3. **Define Models**: Create Python classes that subclass `django.db.models.Model`. These classes will map to your database tables.\n\n4. **Setup Database**: Run `django.setup()` in your script to initialize the Django settings.\n\n5. **Interact with the Database**: Use Django's ORM methods to interact with the database, such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records.\n\nHere's a basic example to illustrate this setup:\n\n```python\nimport django\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models\n\n# Minimal settings configuration\nsettings.configure(\n    DATABASES={\n        'default': {\n            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',\n            'NAME': 'mydatabase.sqlite3',  # Or any other database\n        }\n    }\n)\n\n# Initialize Django\ndjango.setup()\n\n# Define your model\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    age = models.IntegerField()\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'myapp'\n\n# Now you can use the ORM\n# Creating a new record\nmymodel_instance = MyModel(name='John Doe', age=30)\nmymodel_instance.save()\n\n# Querying the database\nfor instance in MyModel.objects.all():\n    print(instance.name, instance.age)\n```\n\nIf you prefer not to use Django's ORM, there are other Python ORMs similar to Hibernate in Java that you might consider:\n\n1. **SQLAlchemy**: This is the most popular ORM library in Python. It provides a full suite of well-known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for efficient and high-performing database access.\n\n2. **Peewee**: A small, expressive ORM that\u2019s easy to use and great for small projects.\n\n3. **Tortoise-ORM**: An easy-to-use asyncio ORM inspired by Django.\n\nEach of these ORMs has its own strengths and usage patterns, so you might choose one based on your specific requirements and project size."
