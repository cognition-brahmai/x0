Below is a Java code snippet that demonstrates how to replace the word \"thief\" with \"hero\" in the provided sentence:\n\n```java\npublic class ReplaceWord {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Original sentence\n        String sentence = \"The thief was caught as he tried to flee.\";\n        \n        // Word to be replaced and the replacement word\n        String wordToReplace = \"thief\";\n        String replacementWord = \"hero\";\n        \n        // Replacing the word using replaceAll() method\n        String modifiedSentence = sentence.replaceAll(wordToReplace, replacementWord);\n        \n        // Printing the modified sentence\n        System.out.println(modifiedSentence);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\nThe hero was caught as he tried to flee.\n```\n\nThis code snippet creates a new string with all instances of \"thief\" replaced by \"hero\", maintaining the original sentence's structure while altering its meaning."
