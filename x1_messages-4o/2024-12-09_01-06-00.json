After installing pytorch with torchvision and the cudatoolkit as they provided on their website, I tried to install Tensorflow. However, I'm getting an UnsatisfiableError while doing so. If I run \"nvcc\" or \"nvidia-smi\" on my host or the activated conda environment, it shows that I have CUDA 10.2 installed, even though \"conda list\" displays that cudatoolkit 9.0 is installed. Moreover, when I run a code sample to check the CUDA version, PyTorch seems to get the correct CUDA version. But, I am unable to install tensorflow-gpu. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing stems from a mismatch between the CUDA version required by the TensorFlow package you're trying to install and the CUDA version available in your conda environment. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to resolving the issue:\n\n1. **Check Compatibility**: \n   - First, ensure that the versions of PyTorch and TensorFlow you are trying to use are compatible with the same CUDA version. You can check the official websites or GitHub repositories for the compatibility matrix. For example, TensorFlow 1.12 requires CUDA 9.0, while PyTorch may work with multiple CUDA versions.\n\n2. **Use a Compatible Version of TensorFlow**:\n   - If you need to use TensorFlow with CUDA 9.0, make sure you are installing a version of TensorFlow that is compatible with CUDA 9.0, like TensorFlow 1.12. You can specify the version when installing with pip:\n     ```bash\n     pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.12.0\n     ```\n\n3. **Create Separate Conda Environments**:\n   - If PyTorch and TensorFlow require different CUDA versions, consider creating separate conda environments for each:\n     ```bash\n     conda create --name pytorch-env python=3.8\n     conda activate pytorch-env\n     conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch\n     ```\n     ```bash\n     conda create --name tensorflow-env python=3.8\n     conda activate tensorflow-env\n     conda install tensorflow-gpu=1.12\n     ```\n\n4. **Check CUDA and cuDNN Installation**:\n   - Ensure that the correct versions of CUDA and cuDNN are installed on your system. If you have system-wide CUDA 10.2 installed, TensorFlow within the conda environment might not be able to use it. Make sure the version matches the one required by your TensorFlow installation.\n\n5. **Use a Conda Channel for TensorFlow**:\n   - If you are still running into issues, try installing TensorFlow from a specific conda channel that may provide better compatibility:\n     ```bash\n     conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow-gpu\n     ```\n\n6. **Verify Environment Setup**:\n   - After installing, verify that the environment is set up correctly by running:\n     ```python\n     import tensorflow as tf\n     print(\"Num GPUs Available: \", len(tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')))\n     ```\n\nBy carefully managing your conda environments and ensuring compatibility between the libraries and CUDA versions, you should be able to resolve the installation conflict."
