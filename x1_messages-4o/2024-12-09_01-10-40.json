        "content": "I am trying to iterate over a list in Python and change the value of the current element, similar to how it's done in PHP with `foreach ($array as &$value) {$value = 123;}`. With this PHP approach, because of the `&` sign, the value is passed as reference and can be altered. Here is the Python code I have tried:\n\n```python\nfor a in _list_:\n    print a\n```\n\nHowever, this only prints every item in the array. It doesn't allow me to alter the array's values. Is there a way I can achieve this in Python?"

        "content": "In Python, you can't directly modify the elements of a list in a `for` loop in the same way as you do with the reference in PHP. However, you can achieve the desired outcome by iterating over the indices of the list and modifying the elements that way. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n_list_ = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nfor i in range(len(_list_)):\n    _list_[i] = 123\n\nprint(_list_)\n```\n\nIn this example, `range(len(_list_))` generates a sequence of indices for the list, allowing you to access and modify each element by its index. After the loop, `_list_` will be `[123, 123, 123, 123, 123]`.\n\nAlternatively, you could use list comprehension if you're creating a new list based on some transformation:\n\n```python\n_list_ = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n_list_ = [123 for _ in _list_]\nprint(_list_)\n```\n\nThis will also result in `_list_` being `[123, 123, 123, 123, 123]`. Choose the approach that best fits your needs!"
