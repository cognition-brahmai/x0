The values of side_length1 and side_length2 are stored in a MySQL database table named \"triangle_sides\" with columns \"adjacent\" and \"opposite\" respectively. You need to write a SQL query to retrieve the values of side_length1 and side_length2 from the table and use them to calculate the length of the hypotenuse. The calculation should be done using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. The result should be rounded to two decimal places and displayed in a Latex formatted equation. Additionally, you need to provide a step-by-step explanation of how you arrived at the final answer, including the values of side_length1, side_length2, and the calculated hypotenuse at each step."

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to write a SQL query to fetch the values from the database, calculate the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem, format the result in LaTeX, and provide a step-by-step explanation.\n\n1. **Retrieve the Values from the Database:**\n\n   We will use a SQL query to select the values of `adjacent` and `opposite` from the `triangle_sides` table:\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT adjacent, opposite FROM triangle_sides;\n   ```\n\n   Assume the query returns the following result:\n\n   | adjacent | opposite |\n   |----------|----------|\n   |    3     |    4     |\n\n2. **Calculate the Hypotenuse:**\n\n   The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (`c`) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (`a` and `b`):\n\n   \\[\n   c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\n   \\]\n\n   Given `a = 3` and `b = 4`, we calculate:\n\n   \\[\n   c = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = \\sqrt{25} = 5\n   \\]\n\n3. **Round the Result:**\n\n   The calculated hypotenuse is already an integer, so rounding to two decimal places still gives us `5.00`.\n\n4. **LaTeX Formatted Equation:**\n\n   The result formatted in LaTeX would be:\n\n   \\[\n   c = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5.00\n   \\]\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n   - **Step 1:** Retrieve the values from the database. We have `adjacent = 3` and `opposite = 4`.\n   - **Step 2:** Apply the Pythagorean theorem: \\( c = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} \\).\n   - **Step 3:** Calculate the squares: \\( 3^2 = 9 \\) and \\( 4^2 = 16 \\).\n   - **Step 4:** Sum the squares: \\( 9 + 16 = 25 \\).\n   - **Step 5:** Take the square root: \\( \\sqrt{25} = 5 \\).\n   - **Step 6:** Round the result to two decimal places: \\( 5.00 \\).\n\nThus, the length of the hypotenuse is \\( 5.00 \\)."
