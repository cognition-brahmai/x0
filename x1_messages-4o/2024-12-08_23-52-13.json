The array in question contains the following four elements: 10, 20, 30, and -2. Once the array is reversed, how do we output the resulting array of integers? Please provide a Mark down code example to illustrate the process."

        "content": "To reverse an array of integers, you can simply swap elements from the beginning of the array with elements from the end of the array, moving towards the center. Here's how you can do it in Python:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_array(arr):\n    # Initialize two pointers, one at the start and the other at the end of the array\n    start = 0\n    end = len(arr) - 1\n    \n    # Loop until the two pointers meet in the middle\n    while start < end:\n        # Swap the elements at the start and end pointers\n        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]\n        \n        # Move the pointers towards the center\n        start += 1\n        end -= 1\n\n# Given array\narray = [10, 20, 30, -2]\n\n# Reverse the array\nreverse_array(array)\n\n# Output the reversed array\nprint(\"Reversed array:\", array)\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\nReversed array: [-2, 30, 20, 10]\n```\n\nThis code snippet defines a function `reverse_array` that takes an array as input and reverses it in place. Initialization of two pointers `start` and `end` allows swapping elements until they meet in the middle. The final output is the reversed array."
