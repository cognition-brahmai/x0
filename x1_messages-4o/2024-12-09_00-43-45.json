        "content": "In a Bash script, you can write a here document (heredoc) to a file by redirecting the output of the heredoc to a file. A heredoc allows you to pass multiple lines of input to a command or redirect them to a file. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Using a heredoc to write content to a file\ncat <<EOF > output.txt\nThis is the first line of text.\nThis is the second line of text.\nYou can include variables like this: $USER\nAnd even execute commands: $(date)\nEOF\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- `cat <<EOF` starts the heredoc. `EOF` is a delimiter that signifies the beginning and end of the heredoc content. You can use any string as a delimiter, but `EOF` is commonly used.\n- The content between `cat <<EOF` and `EOF` is written to the file specified by `> output.txt`.\n- You can include variables and command substitutions within the heredoc, and they will be interpreted.\n- The heredoc content ends when you type the delimiter (`EOF`) on a new line.\n\nWhen you run this script, it will create a file named `output.txt` with the specified content."
