I have written a for loop with two if conditions to achieve this. However, I am interested in knowing if there is a way to accomplish this using list comprehensions with two if conditions."

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this using a list comprehension with two conditions. In list comprehensions, you can use multiple conditions to filter out the elements you want to ignore. Here's how you can modify your list comprehension to ignore strings starting with '91' and '18':\n\n```python\nmy_list = ['91 9925479326', '18002561245', 'All the best', 'good']\n\nfiltered_list = [item for item in my_list if not (item.startswith('91') or item.startswith('18'))]\n\nprint(filtered_list)\n```\n\nIn this code, the list comprehension iterates over each `item` in `my_list` and includes it in `filtered_list` only if it does not start with '91' or '18'. The `not` operator is used to exclude the items that match either of these conditions."
