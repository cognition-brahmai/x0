        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to changes in how `joblib` is imported in the newer versions of `scikit-learn`. Previously, `joblib` was accessible via `sklearn.externals.joblib`, but in recent versions, it has been separated and needs to be installed and imported directly.\n\nHere's how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Install `joblib` directly**:\n\n   First, ensure that you have `joblib` installed separately. You can do this with pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install joblib\n   ```\n\n2. **Modify your import statements**:\n\n   Instead of importing `joblib` from `sklearn.externals`, import it directly after installing:\n\n   ```python\n   import joblib\n   ```\n\n3. **Loading your model**:\n\n   Once `joblib` is correctly imported, you can load your model from S3. Here's a basic example of how you can do it using the `boto3` library to interact with AWS S3:\n\n   ```python\n   import boto3\n   import joblib\n   from io import BytesIO\n\n   # Initialize a session using your AWS credentials\n   s3 = boto3.client('s3', aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',\n                     aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY')\n\n   bucket_name = 'your-bucket-name'\n   model_key = 'path/to/your/model.joblib'\n\n   # Download the model from S3\n   with BytesIO() as model_file:\n       s3.download_fileobj(bucket_name, model_key, model_file)\n       model_file.seek(0)  # Move to the beginning of the file\n       model = joblib.load(model_file)\n\n   # Your model is now loaded and ready to use\n   ```\n\n**Note**: Replace `'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY'`, `'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'`, `'your-bucket-name'`, and `'path/to/your/model.joblib'` with your actual AWS credentials, bucket name, and model key.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to import and load your model without encountering the import error."
