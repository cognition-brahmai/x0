        "content": "I am having trouble typing negative numbers using '.isdigit'. When I try to input a negative number, '.isdigit' interprets the negative symbol '-' as a string value and rejects it. I want '.isdigit' to allow the negative symbol '-'. I am using the following code: \n\n```python\nwhile a <=10 + Z:\n    question = input(\"What is \" + str(n1) + str(op) + str(n2) + \"?\")\n    a = a+1\n\n    if question.lstrip(\"-\").isdigit() is True:\n        ans = ops[op](n1, n2)\n        n1 = random.randint(1,9)\n        n2 = random.randint(1,9)\n        op = random.choice(list(ops))\n\n        if int(question) is ans:\n            count = count + 1\n            Z = Z + 0\n            print (\"Well done\")\n        else:\n            count = count + 0\n            Z = Z + 0\n            print (\"WRONG\")\n    else:\n        count = count + 0\n        Z = Z + 1\n        print (\"Please type in the number\")\n```\n\nThe problem is that, when I type 's1' and 's', it goes to the else part as expected. But when I input a negative number such as -1, '.isdigit' counts the '-' sign as a string value and it rejects it. How can I make it so that '.isdigit' allows negative symbol '-'?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is because the `isdigit()` method in Python only checks for digits, and it doesn't recognize the negative sign ('-') as part of a digit. To handle negative numbers, you can modify your code to strip the negative sign if it exists, and then check if the remaining string is a digit.\n\nYou're already on the right track with using `lstrip(\"-\")`. Here's a revised version of your code with some improvements:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nops = {\n    '+': lambda x, y: x + y,\n    '-': lambda x, y: x - y,\n    '*': lambda x, y: x * y,\n    '/': lambda x, y: x / y if y != 0 else 'undefined'\n}\n\nn1 = random.randint(1, 9)\nn2 = random.randint(1, 9)\nop = random.choice(list(ops))\ncount = 0\nZ = 0\na = 0\n\nwhile a <= 10 + Z:\n    question = input(\"What is \" + str(n1) + str(op) + str(n2) + \"? \")\n    a += 1\n\n    # Strip the negative sign and check if remaining is digit\n    if question.lstrip('-').isdigit():\n        ans = ops[op](n1, n2)\n        \n        # Generate new numbers and operator for next question\n        n1 = random.randint(1, 9)\n        n2 = random.randint(1, 9)\n        op = random.choice(list(ops))\n\n        # Check if the answer is correct\n        if int(question) == ans:\n            count += 1\n            Z += 0\n            print(\"Well done\")\n        else:\n            print(\"WRONG\")\n    else:\n        Z += 1\n        print(\"Please type in the number\")\n\n# Display the total correct answers\nprint(f\"Total correct answers: {count}\")\n```\n\nKey points:\n1. `lstrip('-')` is used to remove the negative sign if present, allowing the remaining part to be checked with `isdigit()`.\n2. Make sure to handle division by zero when using the '/' operator.\n3. I also added spaces and corrected increments for readability and clarity.\n\nThis should work for both positive and negative integer inputs."
