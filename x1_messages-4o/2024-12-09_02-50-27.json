While I have followed the instructions in 'http://www.heikkitoivonen.net/blog/2008/07/21/debugging-python-extension-written-in-c-with-eclipse/', I am still unable to get Eclipse to stop at a breakpoint in the Python extension module. I have added the folder for the Python source and the folder for the python extension code as source folders to the project. I began debug development in Ubuntu, created a debug build of python (python_d), and ran the setup.py for my extension with `python_d setup.py build`. This seemed to yield a debug build of the extension module and I verified that symbols are being exported. However, when I create another project in Eclipse with the folder of my code and add a breakpoint in the source used to create the extension, it doesn't stop at the breakpoint. How can I get Eclipse to stop at a breakpoint in a Python extension module?"

        "content": "Debugging a Python extension module with Eclipse can be tricky, but here are some steps you can follow to troubleshoot and hopefully resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Debug Symbols are Present**: Make sure that the debug symbols are indeed present in the compiled extension module. You can use tools like `nm` or `objdump` on Linux to verify that symbols are available in the compiled shared object (`.so`) file.\n\n2. **Use the Correct Python Interpreter**: Ensure that you are using the debug build of Python (`python_d`) when running your application. This is crucial because it will match the debug symbols and provide the necessary hooks for the debugger.\n\n3. **Check Eclipse Configuration**: Double-check the configuration in Eclipse to ensure that:\n   - You have the correct paths set in the source lookup.\n   - The project is properly set up to use the debug build of the extension.\n   - The breakpoint is set at an executable line of code.\n\n4. **Use GDB Directly**: Sometimes, using GDB directly can provide more insight. You can start Python with GDB and set breakpoints manually. For example:\n   ```bash\n   gdb python_d\n   ```\n   Then, inside GDB:\n   ```gdb\n   (gdb) run your_script.py\n   (gdb) break your_extension.c:line_number\n   ```\n\n5. **Ensure Symbols are Not Optimized Away**: If your extension module was compiled with optimization flags, these might have optimized away some of the debug information. Make sure that your module is compiled with `-O0` and `-g` flags to include debug symbols and disable optimization.\n\n6. **Check the Python Path**: Ensure that the Python path includes the location of your extension module and any other necessary libraries. A mismatch here might cause the debugger to skip loading symbols.\n\n7. **Verify Breakpoint Location**: Make sure that the breakpoint is set in a place that is actually being executed. You can add logging or use `printf` statements to verify the flow of the program.\n\n8. **Rebuild Everything**: Sometimes, starting fresh helps. Clean your build environment and rebuild both Python and your extension module to ensure everything is in sync.\n\n9. **Eclipse CDT Setup**: Make sure you have the CDT (C/C++ Development Tooling) installed correctly in Eclipse and configured to recognize your C/C++ code. Sometimes, the integration can be finicky.\n\nIf these steps don't resolve the issue, consider using a different IDE or debugger that might provide better support for C extensions, such as Visual Studio Code or directly using GDB with a front-end like `DDD` or `Eclipse CDT`."
