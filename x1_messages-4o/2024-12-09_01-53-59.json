When I execute the python script, it creates bottlenecks for the images, and then encounters a critical error at the first training step (step 0), where it tries to divide by zero. This error seems to happen in the get_image_path function when calculating the mod_index, which is index % len(category_list), thus implying that the category_list is 0. Why is this happening and how can I avoid it? The code in question is run inside Docker and the stack trace I get is as follows:\n\n```\n2016-07-04 01:27:52.005912: Step 0: Train accuracy = 40.0%\n2016-07-04 01:27:52.006025: Step 0: Cross entropy = 1.109777\nCRITICAL:tensorflow:Category has no images - validation.\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain.py\", line 824, in &lt;module&gt;\n    tf.app.run()\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/platform/app.py\", line 30, in run\n    sys.exit(main(sys.argv))\n  File \"tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain.py\", line 794, in main\n    bottleneck_tensor))\n  File \"tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain.py\", line 484, in get_random_cached_bottlenecks\n    bottleneck_tensor)\n  File \"tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain.py\", line 392, in get_or_create_bottleneck\n    bottleneck_dir, category)\n  File \"tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain.py\", line 281, in get_bottleneck_path\n    category) + '.txt'\n  File \"tensorflow/examples/image_retraining/retrain.py\", line 257, in get_image_path\n    mod_index = index % len(category_list)\nZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is a `ZeroDivisionError` which indicates that the `category_list` is empty when the `get_image_path` function attempts to calculate `mod_index`. This typically happens when the script expects images to be organized into categories, but it doesn't find any images or directories as expected.\n\nHere are some steps to help you troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Data Organization**: Ensure that the data is organized correctly. The retraining script expects the data to be in a specific directory structure, typically something like:\n\n   ```\n   data/\n       category1/\n           image1.jpg\n           image2.jpg\n           ...\n       category2/\n           image1.jpg\n           image2.jpg\n           ...\n       ...\n   ```\n\n   Each category should have its own subdirectory with images.\n\n2. **Verify Category List**: Double-check that the `category_list` is being populated correctly. This list is usually generated by reading the directories in the data folder. If the script is not finding any directories, the `category_list` will be empty, leading to the division by zero error.\n\n3. **Path Configuration**: Make sure that the path to your data directory is correctly specified in the script. If the script is not pointing to the correct directory, it won't find any images, resulting in an empty `category_list`.\n\n4. **Permissions**: Ensure that the script has the necessary permissions to read the directories and files. Running the script inside Docker might require you to set appropriate permissions or mount volumes correctly.\n\n5. **Print Debug Information**: Add some print statements or use logging to output the contents of the `category_list` before it's used. This will help you verify whether the list is being populated as expected.\n\n6. **Docker Volume Mounting**: Verify that the directory containing your images is correctly mounted in your Docker container. If you're using a volume, ensure it's mapped correctly with something like:\n\n   ```bash\n   docker run -v /path/to/your/data:/app/data ...\n   ```\n\n7. **Check for Empty Directories**: Make sure that none of your category directories are empty. The script might be failing if it encounters an empty category folder.\n\nIf you've gone through these steps and the issue persists, consider simplifying your setup by initially testing with a small set of images and categories to ensure everything is configured correctly before moving on to the full dataset."
