In an online course, the instructor used the `url()` function to call views and utilize regular expressions in the urlpatterns list, for example:\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom django.urls import include\nfrom django.conf.urls import url\n\nurlpatterns = [\n    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),\n    url(r'^polls/', include('polls.urls')),\n]\n```\nAnd in `polls/urls.py`:\n```python\nurlpatterns = [\n    url(r'^$', views.index, name=\"index\"),\n]\n```\nHowever, in the Django tutorial, they use `path()` instead, for example:\n```python\nfrom django.urls import path\nfrom . import views\n\nurlpatterns = [\n    path('', views.index, name=\"index\"),        \n]\n```\nRegular expressions don't seem to work with the `path()` function as using `path(r'^$', views.index, name=\"index\")` won't find the `mysite.com/polls/` view. Is using `path()` without regex matching the proper way going forward? Is `url()` more powerful but more complicated so they're using `path()` to start us out with? Or is it a case of different tools for different jobs?"

        "content": "In Django 2.0 and later, both `path()` and `re_path()` (which replaces `url()`) are available for defining URL patterns, and each serves a specific purpose. Here's a breakdown of when to use each:\n\n1. **`path()`**:\n   - Introduced in Django 2.0, `path()` is designed to handle simpler, more readable URL patterns without the need for regular expressions.\n   - It is suitable for most URL patterns and is encouraged for simplicity and clarity.\n   - It uses converters to capture dynamic parts of the URL, such as `<int:id>`, `<str:name>`, etc.\n\n   Example:\n   ```python\n   urlpatterns = [\n       path('polls/', views.index, name='index'),\n       path('polls/<int:question_id>/', views.detail, name='detail'),\n   ]\n   ```\n\n2. **`re_path()`** (formerly `url()`):\n   - Use `re_path()` when you need the flexibility of regular expressions for more complex URL patterns.\n   - It provides the power to match more complex patterns that cannot be easily expressed with `path()` converters.\n\n   Example:\n   ```python\n   from django.urls import re_path\n\n   urlpatterns = [\n       re_path(r'^$', views.index, name='index'),\n       re_path(r'^polls/(?P<question_id>\\d+)/$', views.detail, name='detail'),\n   ]\n   ```\n\n**Key Points**:\n- For most common use cases, `path()` is recommended because it is simpler and more readable.\n- Use `re_path()` when you need the full power of regular expressions.\n- Django\u2019s move from `url()` to `re_path()` was to make it clear that this function supports regex, while `path()` is meant for simpler, non-regex paths.\n\nIn conclusion, choose `path()` for its simplicity and readability in most cases, and opt for `re_path()` when dealing with more complex patterns that require regex."
