Additionally, can you include a scoring system to evaluate their responses, considering both their technical abilities and soft skills? Furthermore, please provide a chart to illustrate the weight of each question in the scoring system, including how the candidate's response aligns with the company's mission and values.

This example includes a mix of technical and soft skill questions, as well as alignment with company values.\n\n```r\n# Define the questions and weights\nquestions <- c(\"Technical Skills\", \n               \"Problem-Solving Ability\", \n               \"Communication Skills\", \n               \"Teamwork\", \n               \"Alignment with Company Values\")\n\nweights <- c(0.3, 0.2, 0.2, 0.15, 0.15) # Weights must sum to 1\n\n# Define a scoring system for each question\n# Scores can be from 1 to 5, where 1 is poor and 5 is excellent\ncandidate_scores <- data.frame(\n  Technical_Skills = c(4),\n  Problem_Solving_Ability = c(3),\n  Communication_Skills = c(5),\n  Teamwork = c(4),\n  Alignment_with_Company_Values = c(5)\n)\n\n# Calculate the weighted score\nweighted_score <- sum(candidate_scores * weights)\n\n# Print the weighted score\nprint(paste(\"Candidate's Weighted Score: \", weighted_score))\n\n# Plot the scoring system\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nscoring_data <- data.frame(\n  Question = questions,\n  Weight = weights,\n  Candidate_Score = as.numeric(candidate_scores[1,])\n)\n\n# Create a bar chart\nggplot(scoring_data, aes(x = Question, y = Candidate_Score, fill = Question)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = Candidate_Score), vjust = -0.5) +\n  ylim(0, 5) +\n  labs(title = \"Candidate Scoring System\",\n       x = \"Interview Questions\",\n       y = \"Score\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n# Create a pie chart for weights\nggplot(scoring_data, aes(x = \"\", y = Weight, fill = Question)) +\n  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = \"identity\") +\n  coord_polar(\"y\") +\n  labs(title = \"Weight Distribution of Interview Questions\") +\n  theme_void()\n```\n\nThis script does the following:\n\n1. Defines a list of questions and assigns weights to each, reflecting their importance in evaluating the candidate.\n2. Records a candidate's scores for each question.\n3. Calculates a weighted score based on the candidate's responses.\n4. Visualizes the evaluation using a bar chart for the candidate's scores and a pie chart for the weight distribution of the questions.\n\nMake sure to adjust the candidate\u2019s scores and weights based on your specific criteria and company values. This script assumes you have the `ggplot2` package installed for plotting. You can install it using `install.packages(\"ggplot2\")` if necessary."
