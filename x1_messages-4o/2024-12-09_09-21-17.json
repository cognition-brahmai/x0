        "content": "In Ruby, you can calculate the length of a string using the `length` or `size` method. Both methods return the number of characters in the string. Here is a simple example:\n\n```ruby\nstring = \"Hello, world!\"\nlength = string.length\n# or you can use\n# length = string.size\n\nputs \"The length of the string is #{length}.\"\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\nThe length of the string is 13.\n```\n\nBoth `length` and `size` are commonly used, and they are interchangeable in this context."
