Are there any TensorFlow 2 implementations of RCNN or other object detection models available? Alternatively, is there a stable Docker image that could work with Matterport?"

        "content": "For TensorFlow 2, you have several options for implementing Mask R-CNN or other object detection models:\n\n1. **TensorFlow Object Detection API**: This is a powerful library that supports various object detection models including Mask R-CNN. The TensorFlow Object Detection API is compatible with TensorFlow 2.x and provides pre-trained models, allowing you to fine-tune them on your dataset.\n\n2. **Keras Implementation of Mask R-CNN**: There are community implementations of Mask R-CNN compatible with TensorFlow 2.x. One such example is the `matterport/Mask_RCNN` repository, which has been adapted by different developers to work with TensorFlow 2.x. You can find these updated forks on GitHub.\n\n3. **Detectron2**: Although primarily for PyTorch, Detectron2 is a robust library developed by Facebook AI Research and offers state-of-the-art object detection models, including Mask R-CNN. If you're open to using PyTorch, this is a great option.\n\n4. **Docker Image**: If you want to use the original Matterport implementation with TensorFlow 1.x, you can look for Docker images that encapsulate the required environment. This might involve using Docker containers with TF 1.x and the necessary dependencies pre-installed. You can search for community-contributed Docker images or create your own Dockerfile based on the requirements specified in the Matterport repository.\n\nFor a stable and updated solution, I recommend exploring the TensorFlow Object Detection API, as it is actively maintained and provides comprehensive support for TensorFlow 2.x."
