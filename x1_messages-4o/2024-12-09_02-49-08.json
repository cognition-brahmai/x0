        "content": "It looks like you're encountering a common issue related to linking the OpenSSL libraries when trying to install `mysql-python` on macOS. Since you've already installed OpenSSL with Homebrew, you'll need to ensure that the correct library paths are included in your build environment. Here's a step-by-step guide to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Locate OpenSSL**:\n   First, find out where Homebrew installed OpenSSL (usually in `/usr/local/opt/openssl` or `/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1`).\n\n   ```bash\n   brew --prefix openssl\n   ```\n\n2. **Set Environment Variables**:\n   You need to set the `CFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` environment variables to point to the OpenSSL includes and libraries. Replace `/usr/local/opt/openssl` with the actual path from the previous step.\n\n   ```bash\n   export CFLAGS=\"-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include\"\n   export LDFLAGS=\"-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Install mysqlclient**:\n   Instead of `mysql-python`, consider using `mysqlclient`, which is a maintained fork of MySQL-Python and supports Python 3.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install mysqlclient\n   ```\n\n4. **Troubleshooting**:\n   If you still encounter issues, ensure that your Xcode command line tools are up-to-date since macOS often relies on them for compiling native extensions.\n\n   ```bash\n   xcode-select --install\n   ```\n\n5. **Virtual Environment Considerations**:\n   Make sure your virtual environment is activated when you set the environment variables and install packages.\n\nFollowing these steps should help you resolve the linking error with OpenSSL and successfully install the MySQL client library. If you continue to face issues, ensure that Homebrew is up-to-date and consider reinstalling OpenSSL and MySQL through Homebrew."
