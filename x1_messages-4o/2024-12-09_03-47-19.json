Currently, I am using the following approach:\n\n```python\ninNumber = somenumber\ninNumberint = int(inNumber)\nif inNumber == inNumberint:\n    print \"this number is an int\"\nelse:\n    print \"this number is a float\"\n```\nThis method works, but I am interested in finding a cleaner or more Pythonic way to achieve the same result."

        "content": "A more elegant and Pythonic way to determine if a number is an integer or a float is to use the `isinstance()` function. This approach is more concise and readable. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ninNumber = somenumber\n\nif isinstance(inNumber, int):\n    print(\"this number is an int\")\nelif isinstance(inNumber, float):\n    print(\"this number is a float\")\nelse:\n    print(\"this is neither an int nor a float\")\n```\n\nThis code checks the type of `inNumber` directly, which is clearer and more efficient than converting the number to an integer and comparing it. This way, you also handle the case where `inNumber` might not be a number at all."
