        "content": "How can I set different compiler flags for C++ and CUDA C++ files in a CMake project? I am using CMake 3.8+ which intrinsically supports CUDA C++. I have a single target that includes both C++ (`.cpp`) and CUDA C++ (`.cu`) files. Here's what I have at the top of my `CMakeLists.txt`:\n\n```cmake\nproject(my-project CUDA CXX)\n```\n\nI'd like to use the `target_compile_options()` command to set different compiler flags for the different compilers. I've considered two solutions: one where I add compile options for my target:\n\n```cmake\nadd_compile_options(my_target\n    PRIVATE\n    $<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CXX>:-Wsign-conversion\n    $<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CUDA>:-arch=compute_30\n)\n```\n\nAnd another where I create two separate targets for the `.cpp` and `.cu` files, and set the compiler options separately for the GCC and NVCC targets. Both options work, but I'm not sure which is best. Additionally, I'm having trouble with the first solution when I want to include multiple compiler flags. What is the proper way to split them and span the expression across multiple lines without causing syntax errors in CMake? I'd also like to avoid manually altering `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` and `CMAKE_CUDA_FLAGS`. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

        "content": "To set different compiler flags for C++ and CUDA C++ files in a single CMake target, using generator expressions with `target_compile_options()` is a clean and effective approach. You can specify different flags for each language using the `$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:LANG>` generator expression. This allows you to keep a single target while applying different compile options based on the file type.\n\nHere's how you can properly set multiple flags for both C++ and CUDA files using the generator expressions, ensuring you handle multiple lines correctly:\n\n```cmake\n# Assuming my_target is your target that includes both .cpp and .cu files\ntarget_compile_options(my_target\n    PRIVATE\n    # Compiler flags for C++ files\n    $<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CXX>:\n    -Wsign-conversion\n    -Wall\n    -Wextra\n\n    # Compiler flags for CUDA files\n    $<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CUDA>:\n    -arch=compute_30\n    -Xptxas=-v\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Generator Expressions**: The `$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:LANG>` expression is used to apply specific flags based on the language being compiled (CXX for C++, CUDA for CUDA).\n\n2. **Multiple Flags**: You can add multiple flags for each language by simply listing them after the generator expression. Ensure each flag is space-separated within the same generator expression context.\n\n3. **Line Continuation**: In CMake, you can continue lines by using a space at the end of each line or by starting the next line directly with the next item. CMake treats whitespace and newlines as separators between list items.\n\n### Considerations:\n\n- **Maintainability**: Using generator expressions keeps your CMake configuration clean and easy to maintain, especially as your project grows.\n\n- **Avoid Global Flags**: As you mentioned, avoid altering `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` and `CMAKE_CUDA_FLAGS` globally unless you want the changes to apply to all targets. This approach with `target_compile_options()` is more target-specific.\n\n- **Single vs. Multiple Targets**: Keeping a single target simplifies dependency management and linking. Splitting into multiple targets is often unnecessary unless you have very distinct build requirements or dependencies for the different codebases.\n\nBy using these practices, you can manage your compile options in a structured and scalable manner while keeping your CMake configuration clean and organized."
