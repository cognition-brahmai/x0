        "content": "To get a random open TCP port on localhost using Python, you can use the `socket` library. The idea is to bind a socket to port 0, which tells the operating system to automatically select an available port for you. Here's a simple way to do it:\n\n```python\nimport socket\n\ndef get_random_open_port():\n    # Create a socket\n    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:\n        # Bind the socket to address ('', 0) to let the OS choose an available port\n        s.bind(('', 0))\n        # Get the port number that was chosen\n        port = s.getsockname()[1]\n    return port\n\n# Example usage\nrandom_port = get_random_open_port()\nprint(f\"Random open port: {random_port}\")\n```\n\nThis code creates a socket, binds it to an address with port `0`, and retrieves the automatically assigned port number. After the port number is obtained, the socket is closed, which makes the port available for use again."
