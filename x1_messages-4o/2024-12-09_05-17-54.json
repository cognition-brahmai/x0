Currently, I am doing it in two steps:\n```cpp\nthrust::transform(b.begin(), b.end(), c.begin(), b.begin(), thrust::plus<int>());\nthrust::transform(a.begin(), a.end(), b.begin(), a.begin(), thrust::plus<int>());\n```\nHowever, I am wondering if there is a way to achieve the same result in just one line of code. I have looked at the saxpy implementation but it only uses two vectors and a constant value. Is there a more efficient way, say using an arbitrary functor like this:\n```cpp\nstruct arbitrary_functor\n{\n    template <typename Tuple>\n    __host__ __device__\n    void operator()(Tuple t)\n    {\n        // D[i] = A[i] + B[i] + C[i];\n        thrust::get<3>(t) = thrust::get<0>(t) + thrust::get<1>(t) + thrust::get<2>(t);\n    }\n};\n```\nIs the above code more efficient?"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve the operation `a = a + b + c` in a single step by using a custom functor with `thrust::transform`. The approach you suggested with `arbitrary_functor` is a good way to handle this operation efficiently. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n1. Use `thrust::make_zip_iterator` to combine the three input vectors and the output vector.\n2. Apply `thrust::transform` with your custom functor to perform the operation.\n\nHere's how you can implement this approach:\n\n```cpp\n#include <thrust/host_vector.h>\n#include <thrust/device_vector.h>\n#include <thrust/transform.h>\n#include <thrust/iterator/zip_iterator.h>\n#include <thrust/tuple.h>\n\nstruct arbitrary_functor\n{\n    template <typename Tuple>\n    __host__ __device__\n    void operator()(Tuple t)\n    {\n        // D[i] = A[i] + B[i] + C[i];\n        thrust::get<3>(t) = thrust::get<0>(t) + thrust::get<1>(t) + thrust::get<2>(t);\n    }\n};\n\nint main()\n{\n    // Example vectors\n    thrust::device_vector<int> a(10, 1); // Initialize with 1s\n    thrust::device_vector<int> b(10, 2); // Initialize with 2s\n    thrust::device_vector<int> c(10, 3); // Initialize with 3s\n\n    // Perform the operation a = a + b + c in one step\n    thrust::transform(\n        thrust::make_zip_iterator(thrust::make_tuple(a.begin(), b.begin(), c.begin(), a.begin())),\n        thrust::make_zip_iterator(thrust::make_tuple(a.end(), b.end(), c.end(), a.end())),\n        thrust::make_zip_iterator(thrust::make_tuple(a.begin(), b.begin(), c.begin(), a.begin())),\n        arbitrary_functor()\n    );\n\n    // a now contains the result of a + b + c\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- We use `thrust::make_zip_iterator` to create an iterator that iterates over tuples of elements from each vector.\n- We define a custom functor `arbitrary_functor` that takes a tuple of elements and performs the desired operation.\n- We apply `thrust::transform` to the zipped iterators and pass our custom functor to perform the operation in a single step.\n\nThis approach is efficient and leverages the parallel processing capabilities of Thrust to perform the operation in one pass over the data."
