        "content": "To evaluate the grammar of your SQL query, we need to ensure that the `order_date` value is properly formatted as a date string. Additionally, to handle situations where multiple orders were closed on the same date, you might want to consider using an `ORDER BY` clause or using an aggregate function if you're looking for a specific type of summary (such as a count of orders).\n\nHere's an improved version of your query with a suggestion for handling multiple orders on the same date:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * \nFROM orders \nWHERE order_date = '2021-10-20' AND status = 'closed'\nORDER BY order_id; -- Assuming order_id is a column that uniquely identifies each order\n```\n\nIf you are interested in simply counting the number of orders closed on that date, you could use the `COUNT` function:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS closed_order_count\nFROM orders \nWHERE order_date = '2021-10-20' AND status = 'closed';\n```\n\nIf you want more detailed information like total sales or any other specific metric, you can adjust the aggregate functions accordingly. For example, if each order has an `amount` column, you could sum the total of closed orders for that day:\n\n```sql\nSELECT SUM(amount) AS total_closed_sales\nFROM orders \nWHERE order_date = '2021-10-20' AND status = 'closed';\n```\n\nRemember to adjust column names and logic according to your actual database schema and requirements."
