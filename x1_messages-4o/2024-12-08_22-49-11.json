        "content": "To calculate the total price for purchasing 120 eggs, first consider that 1 dozen equals 12 eggs. Therefore, 120 eggs would be:\n\n\\[ \\frac{120 \\text{ eggs}}{12 \\text{ eggs/dozen}} = 10 \\text{ dozen} \\]\n\nNext, to find the total price, you would need to know the price per dozen. If you have the price per dozen, multiply it by 10 to get the total cost for 10 dozen eggs. For example, if the price per dozen is \u20b950, the calculation would be:\n\n\\[ 10 \\text{ dozen} \\times \u20b950/\\text{dozen} = \u20b9500 \\]\n\nPlease provide the price per dozen if you would like a specific calculation."
