        "content": "In PyQt, you can use `QFileDialog` to display a file browser dialog that allows the selection of only directories. To achieve this, you can set the dialog to directory-only mode using the `setFileMode` method. Here\u2019s an example of how you can create such a dialog and retrieve the name of the selected directory:\n\n```python\nfrom PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QFileDialog, QWidget\nimport sys\n\nclass DirectorySelector(QWidget):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n\n    def get_directory(self):\n        # Create a QFileDialog instance\n        dialog = QFileDialog(self)\n        \n        # Set the dialog to allow directory selection only\n        dialog.setFileMode(QFileDialog.DirectoryOnly)\n        \n        # Open the dialog and check if the user selected a directory\n        if dialog.exec_() == QFileDialog.Accepted:\n            # Get the selected directory\n            selected_directory = dialog.selectedFiles()[0]\n            return selected_directory\n        return None\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app = QApplication(sys.argv)\n    selector = DirectorySelector()\n    selected_directory = selector.get_directory()\n    \n    if selected_directory:\n        print(f\"Selected directory: {selected_directory}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No directory selected\")\n\n    sys.exit(app.exec_())\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Import Modules**: Import necessary modules from PyQt5 and Python system libraries.\n2. **DirectorySelector Class**: Create a class `DirectorySelector` that inherits from `QWidget`. This class will handle the functionality of directory selection.\n3. **get_directory Method**:\n   - Instantiate a `QFileDialog`.\n   - Set the file mode to `QFileDialog.DirectoryOnly` to restrict selection to directories.\n   - Execute the dialog using `dialog.exec_()`. If the user selects a directory and confirms, the method returns the selected directory path.\n4. **Running the Application**:\n   - Initialize a `QApplication` and `DirectorySelector`.\n   - Call `get_directory()` to open the dialog and retrieve the selected directory.\n   - Print the selected directory path or a message indicating no directory was selected.\n5. **Application Loop**: `sys.exit(app.exec_())` starts the application event loop.\n\nThis script will display a dialog to the user, allowing them to browse and select only directories. Once a directory is selected, its path is printed to the console."
