The full error output is below:\n\n```\nC:\\Users\\Costello\\PycharmProjects\\test\\venv\\Scripts\\python.exe C:/Users/Costello/PycharmProjects/test\nC:\\Users\\Costello\\PycharmProjects\\test\\venv\\Scripts\\python.exe: can't find '__main__' module in 'C:/Users/Costello/PycharmProjects/test'\n```\n\nThe problem persists regardless of the function I run, even with a simple print function. The issue appears only in Pycharm as everything works fine when I use idle or VS Code. I've also tried choosing the regular Python interpreter in Pycharm, but the same error occurs: \n\n```\nC:\\Users\\Costello\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python37\\python.exe: can't find '__main__' module in 'C:/Users/Costello/PycharmProjects/test'\n```\n\nI think the problem might be related to how I have set up Pycharm, but I can't define the specific issue. Any ideas on how to resolve this?"

        "content": "It sounds like the issue you're encountering is related to how PyCharm is configured to run your script. The error message \"can't find '__main__' module\" typically indicates that PyCharm is trying to execute a directory rather than a specific Python script file. Here are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Your Run Configuration:**\n   - Open your project in PyCharm.\n   - Go to \"Run\" > \"Edit Configurations...\" in the top menu.\n   - Ensure that the \"Script path\" field points to a specific Python script file within your project directory (e.g., `C:/Users/Costello/PycharmProjects/test/main.py`) and not just the directory itself.\n   - Make sure the \"Working directory\" field is set to your project directory, i.e., `C:/Users/Costello/PycharmProjects/test`.\n\n2. **Create a New Run Configuration:**\n   - If the existing configuration seems incorrect or corrupted, try creating a new one.\n   - Click the \"+\" button to add a new configuration, select \"Python\" from the list, and fill in the necessary details (script path, interpreter, etc.).\n\n3. **Verify Interpreter Settings:**\n   - Go to \"File\" > \"Settings\" (or \"Preferences\" on macOS).\n   - Navigate to \"Project: [YourProjectName]\" > \"Python Interpreter\".\n   - Make sure the correct interpreter is selected (either your virtualenv interpreter or the system Python interpreter).\n   - If using a virtual environment, ensure it is properly activated.\n\n4. **Check for Syntax and Errors in the Script:**\n   - Ensure that your script contains a `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block if necessary, although this is usually not the cause of the issue you're facing.\n   - Confirm there are no syntax errors in your script that could be causing issues.\n\n5. **Reinstall PyCharm or Update:**\n   - Sometimes, reinstalling PyCharm or updating to the latest version can resolve unexpected issues.\n\n6. **Check for Project Structure:**\n   - Ensure your project structure is set up correctly. You should have a directory with your main Python script and any additional modules or packages you need.\n   - Avoid naming your script with names that conflict with Python modules or packages (e.g., `test.py`).\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and run your script successfully in PyCharm. If the problem persists, consider creating a new project in PyCharm and copying your script files over to see if the issue is related to the specific project setup."
