        "content": "In Python 2, comparisons between different data types such as strings and integers, or between numbers and collections like lists and tuples, are allowed but can lead to surprising and non-intuitive results. This behavior is based on the language specifications of Python 2, where types were compared based on their names rather than their underlying values or structures. Let's break down the code snippet you provided:\n\n1. **String Comparisons:**\n   ```python\n   print \"100\" < \"2\"  # True\n   print \"5\" > \"9\"    # False\n   ```\n   These comparisons are based on lexicographical order, similar to how words are ordered in a dictionary. Hence, \"100\" is considered smaller than \"2\" because the comparison is done character by character, and \"1\" is less than \"2\". Similarly, \"5\" is less than \"9\".\n\n2. **String and Integer Comparisons:**\n   ```python\n   print \"100\" < 2    # False\n   print 100 < \"2\"    # True\n   ```\n   In Python 2, comparing a string with a number results in comparing their types. The comparison is made based on the type name, so `str` (string) is considered greater than `int` (integer). Therefore, \"100\" < 2 evaluates to False, and 100 < \"2\" evaluates to True.\n\n3. **List and Infinite Float Comparisons:**\n   ```python\n   print [] > float('inf') # True\n   ```\n   This is a comparison between a list and a float. In Python 2, lists are considered greater than numbers, including `float('inf')`, because the type name `list` is greater than `float`.\n\n4. **Tuple and List Comparisons:**\n   ```python\n   print () > [] # True\n   ```\n   Tuples are considered greater than lists because the type name `tuple` comes after `list` in lexicographical order.\n\n**Language Specifications and Implementations:**\n- This behavior is indeed governed by the language specifications of Python 2.\n- In Python 3, this behavior was changed, and such comparisons between incompatible types raise a `TypeError`.\n- There are generally no differences in this behavior across major Python implementations of Python 2, as this is specified by the language.\n\nIn summary, these comparison behaviors in Python 2 stem from the use of type names for ordering, which can be unintuitive and lead to potential bugs. This was one of the reasons for changing how comparisons are handled in Python 3."
