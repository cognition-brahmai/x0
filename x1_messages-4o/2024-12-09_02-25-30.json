I have a kernel call that fails with an \"out of memory\" error, and I suspect this is due to significant usage of the stack frame. When I invoke nvcc with --ptxas-options=-v, it prints the profile information as follows:\n\n```\n150352 bytes stack frame, 0 bytes spill stores, 0 bytes spill loads\nptxas info    : Used 59 registers, 40 bytes cmem[0]\n```\n\nI am working with a GTX480, sm20, 1.5GB device memory and 48KB shared memory per multiprocessor. I am curious about where the stack frame is allocated: In shared, global memory, constant memory, etc.? I encounter the \"out of memory\" issue regardless if I use 1 thread per block or 32 threads per block. Additionally, I understand that the number of threads resident to one multiprocessor can only be increased if the total numbers of registers do not exceed the available registers at the multiprocessor (32k for my card). Does a similar principle apply to the stack frame size?"

        "content": "In CUDA, the stack frame for kernels is allocated in global memory. When you see a large stack frame size like 150352 bytes, it indicates that the kernel uses a significant amount of stack space, which can contribute to running out of memory on the device.\n\nHere are a few key points to consider regarding stack frame usage in CUDA:\n\n1. **Memory Allocation**: The stack frame is not allocated in shared memory, constant memory, or registers. Instead, it resides in global memory. This means that each thread's stack frame will consume global memory space, and excessive stack usage can lead to out-of-memory errors, especially if the kernel launch configuration results in a large number of threads.\n\n2. **Register and Stack Usage**: While registers are limited and shared among threads on a multiprocessor, stack frames are allocated per thread in global memory. The register usage you see (59 registers) is separate from the stack frame size.\n\n3. **Impact on Occupancy**: Similar to how high register usage can reduce the number of threads that can be active on a multiprocessor (occupancy), large stack frames can similarly limit the number of threads that can be launched due to global memory constraints. However, this limitation is not about the number of active threads per multiprocessor but rather the total memory available on the device.\n\n4. **Optimization Suggestions**:\n   - **Reduce Stack Usage**: Try to reduce the stack usage by optimizing your code. This can involve minimizing local variables within your kernel or restructuring your code to use shared memory or registers more effectively.\n   - **Increase Block Size**: If possible, increase the number of threads per block to better utilize the available resources, though this must be balanced with the constraints imposed by register and shared memory usage.\n   - **Check for Large Data Structures**: Ensure that large data structures are not being allocated on the stack. Consider moving them to global or shared memory if applicable.\n\nBy understanding these aspects, you can better manage your kernel's resource usage and potentially resolve the out-of-memory error you're encountering."
