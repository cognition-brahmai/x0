        "content": "Certainly! To modify a plot in Matplotlib so that only the left and bottom borders are displayed, you can customize the spine visibility. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Sample data\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ny = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]\n\n# Create a plot\nplt.plot(x, y)\n\n# Hide the top and right spines\nax = plt.gca()  # Get the current axes\nax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)\n\n# Optionally adjust the ticks position\nax.yaxis.set_ticks_position('left')\nax.xaxis.set_ticks_position('bottom')\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis code snippet does the following:\n- Plots some sample data.\n- Hides the top and right spines by setting their visibility to `False`.\n- Ensures that the ticks are only on the left and bottom sides of the plot.\n\nYou can modify this code to fit your specific data and plotting requirements."
