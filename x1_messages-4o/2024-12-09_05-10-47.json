I know that randrange([start], stop[, step]) allows you to pass a step argument and that random.randrange(0, 1) does not consider the last item, while randint(0, 1) does. However, I don't understand why randrange(0, 1) does not return 0 or 1. Why would I use randrange(0, 2) instead of randrange(0, 1)?"

        "content": "In Python's `random` module, both `random.randint` and `random.randrange` are used to generate random numbers, but they do have some differences in terms of functionality and behavior.\n\n1. **`random.randint(a, b)`**:\n   - This function returns a random integer `N` such that `a <= N <= b`. It includes both endpoints `a` and `b`. In other words, the range is inclusive of both `a` and `b`.\n   - Example: `random.randint(0, 1)` can return either 0 or 1.\n\n2. **`random.randrange([start], stop[, step])`**:\n   - This function returns a randomly selected element from `range(start, stop, step)`. The `start` is optional and defaults to 0. The `stop` is mandatory, and the range generated does not include the `stop` value.\n   - Because `stop` is exclusive, `random.randrange(0, 1)` would only generate numbers in the range `[0]`, which means it can only return 0.\n   - To include 1 as a possible result, you should use `random.randrange(0, 2)`, which generates numbers in the range `[0, 1]`.\n\nThe reason for using `randrange(0, 2)` instead of `randrange(0, 1)` is to ensure that the range includes both 0 and 1 as potential outcomes. Since `randrange` excludes the stop value, you need to specify `stop` as one more than the maximum value you want to include.\n\nIn summary:\n- Use `random.randint(0, 1)` when you want a random integer that could be 0 or 1.\n- Use `random.randrange(0, 2)` for the same purpose, ensuring the range includes both 0 and 1. `random.randrange(0, 1)` would only return 0."
