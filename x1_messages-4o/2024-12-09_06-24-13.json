        "content": "Should I compare enum instances in Python by identity or equality? According to the Python documentation, enum members are singletons and I've been using the equality operators so far without any issues. However, PEP8 suggests that we should always use is/is not and never the equality operators for \"singletons like None\". What is the drawback, if any, of using equality for enum instances? Or is it just a micro-optimisation? Here is an example of my code:\n\n```python\nfrom enum import Enum\n\nclass Potato(Enum):\n    spud = 1234\n    chat = 1234\n\nx = 1234\ny = 1234\nprint(x is y)  # False\n\nx = Potato.spud\ny = Potato.chat\nprint(x is y)  # True\n\nprint(x.value is y.value)  # True\n```"

        "content": "In Python, Enums are designed to be singletons, meaning that each member of the Enum is unique and consistent across the application. When you are comparing enum members, using either identity (`is`) or equality (`==`) can work, but there are some nuances to consider.\n\n1. **Identity (`is`)**:\n   - Using `is` checks if two variables point to the exact same object in memory. Since Enum members are singletons, comparing them with `is` is appropriate and efficient, ensuring that you are indeed referring to the same instance.\n   - Example: `x is y` checks if `x` and `y` are the exact same instance of an Enum member.\n\n2. **Equality (`==`)**:\n   - Using `==` checks if the values of two objects are equivalent, which works well when comparing Enum members because they are designed to behave like constants with unique identities and equivalent values.\n   - Python's Enum members will correctly handle equality checks, so using `==` is perfectly valid and will yield the correct result.\n\nIn your specific case:\n\n- `x is y` returns `True` for `Potato.spud` and `Potato.chat`, indicating that they are referring to the same singleton instance. However, this seems incorrect based on your example; it should typically return `False` since `spud` and `chat` should be distinct Enum members, even if they have the same value.\n  \n- `x.value is y.value` returns `True` because both the `value` attributes of `spud` and `chat` are the same integer `1234`.\n\nIn practice, using `is` for comparing enum members is considered idiomatic and slightly more performant due to the reduced overhead of checking the memory address rather than the values. However, using `==` is also acceptable and commonly seen in the code for readability and intuitive understanding.\n\nRegarding PEP8:\n- The guideline you mentioned is primarily for immutable singletons like `None`, `True`, and `False`, where identity checks (`is`) are semantically more appropriate. Although Enums are also singletons, using `==` is not considered harmful or incorrect.\n\nIn summary, there is no significant drawback to using `==` for enums, and it often comes down to personal or project coding style preferences. If you want to strictly adhere to the idea of treating Enums like other singletons, use `is`, but using `==` is perfectly fine and will not cause issues as Enum members inherently support equality checks."
