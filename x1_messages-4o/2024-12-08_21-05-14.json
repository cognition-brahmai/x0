        "content": "To provide an analysis of air pollution levels caused by different sources, let's first outline the major sources of air pollution and then present the data in an Excel table format.\n\n### Major Sources of Air Pollution:\n\n1. **Transportation**: Emissions from cars, trucks, airplanes, and other vehicles.\n2. **Industry**: Emissions from manufacturing processes, power plants, and other industrial activities.\n3. **Agriculture**: Emissions from livestock, fertilizers, and pesticides.\n4. **Residential**: Emissions from heating, cooking, and other household activities.\n5. **Natural Sources**: Wildfires, dust storms, and other natural events.\n\n### Excel Table Format:\n\n| Source of Pollution  | Particulate Matter (PM2.5) | Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) | Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) | Carbon Monoxide (CO) | Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) | Contribution Percentage |\n|----------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Transportation       | High                       | Very High             | Medium               | Very High            | High                             | 25%                    |\n| Industry             | Medium                     | High                  | Very High            | Medium               | Medium                           | 30%                    |\n| Agriculture          | Medium                     | Low                   | Low                  | Low                  | Medium                           | 10%                    |\n| Residential          | Medium                     | Medium                | Low                  | Medium               | High                             | 15%                    |\n| Natural Sources      | High                       | Low                   | Low                  | Low                  | Low                              | 20%                    |\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Transportation** is a significant contributor to air pollution, especially in terms of NOx and CO emissions.\n- **Industry** is the major source of SO2 emissions due to the burning of fossil fuels and industrial processes.\n- **Agriculture** contributes primarily through VOCs and PM2.5, often due to livestock and crop management practices.\n- **Residential activities** contribute to PM2.5 and VOC emissions, mainly from heating and cooking.\n- **Natural sources** can be significant, especially during events like wildfires, contributing to PM2.5 levels.\n\nThis table and analysis provide a snapshot of how different sources contribute to air pollution. The contribution percentages can vary based on geographic location and specific local activities."
