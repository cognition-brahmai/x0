        "content": "Debian 7 (Wheezy) is quite an old release, and it doesn't have Python 3.5 available in its repositories. Python 3.5 was released after Debian Wheezy, so you'll need to take a different approach to install it. Here are a few options you can consider:\n\n### Option 1: Use `deadsnakes` PPA (not available directly on Debian 7)\n\nThe `deadsnakes` PPA is a popular source for newer Python versions on Ubuntu and Debian systems. However, it does not support Debian 7 directly. If possible, consider upgrading your Debian version to a more recent release that is supported by `deadsnakes`.\n\n### Option 2: Build Python 3.5 from Source\n\nIf upgrading is not an option, you can build Python 3.5 from source. This method is a bit more involved but will allow you to install the specific version you need.\n\n1. **Install Necessary Dependencies:**\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install -y wget build-essential checkinstall \\\n       libreadline-gplv2-dev libncursesw5-dev libssl-dev \\\n       libsqlite3-dev tk-dev libgdbm-dev libc6-dev libbz2-dev \\\n       libffi-dev\n   ```\n\n2. **Download Python 3.5 Source Code:**\n\n   ```bash\n   wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.10/Python-3.5.10.tgz\n   tar xzf Python-3.5.10.tgz\n   cd Python-3.5.10\n   ```\n\n3. **Build and Install Python:**\n\n   ```bash\n   ./configure --enable-optimizations\n   make -j8  # Adjust '8' to the number of processor cores you have.\n   sudo make altinstall\n   ```\n\n   The `altinstall` command is used to prevent overwriting the default `python` binary.\n\n4. **Verify Installation:**\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.5 --version\n   ```\n\n### Option 3: Use a Virtual Environment with a Newer Python Installer\n\nYou can set up a virtual environment with a more recent installer if you don't need system-wide access to Python 3.5.\n\n1. **Install `pyenv`:**\n\n   `pyenv` allows you to manage multiple Python versions.\n\n   ```bash\n   curl https://pyenv.run | bash\n   ```\n\n   Follow the instructions to add `pyenv` to your shell's configuration file.\n\n2. **Install Python 3.5 Using `pyenv`:**\n\n   ```bash\n   pyenv install 3.5.10\n   pyenv global 3.5.10\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify Installation:**\n\n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   ```\n\n### Consider Upgrading Debian\n\nIf feasible, upgrading your system to a newer Debian release would make it easier to install and manage newer software. Debian Wheezy has reached the end of its life, and using an unsupported version can pose security risks."
