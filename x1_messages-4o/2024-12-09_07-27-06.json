I currently have it set up so that all of my templates extend `base.html`, but this doesn't have its own view function. I need to adapt the upper bar in `base.html` to show different buttons depending on which group the logged-in user belongs to. I'm currently using `{% if user.is_authenticated %}` in `base.html`, but this isn't sufficient as I need to distinguish between users from 'Customers' and 'Sellers'. Ideally, I'm looking to implement something similar to `{% if user.in_group('Customers') %}` and `{% if user.in_group('Sellers') %}`."

        "content": "To implement group-based conditional logic in your templates, especially when you're dealing with user groups like 'Customers' and 'Sellers', you'll need to ensure that your Django project is set up properly to handle this. Here\u2019s a step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Ensure Group Membership**: First, ensure that your users are correctly assigned to the relevant groups. You can do this through Django's admin panel or programmatically.\n\n2. **Custom Template Filter or Tag**: To use a clean and reusable approach in your templates, you can create a custom template filter or tag to check group membership.\n\n3. **Create a Custom Template Filter**:\n   - Create a file named `templatetags` in one of your app directories (if it doesn't already exist), and add an `__init__.py` file inside it to make it a package.\n   - Create a new Python file inside `templatetags` (e.g., `user_filters.py`).\n\n```python\n# templatetags/user_filters.py\nfrom django import template\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import Group\n\nregister = template.Library()\n\n@register.filter(name='in_group')\ndef in_group(user, group_name):\n    group = Group.objects.get(name=group_name)\n    return group in user.groups.all()\n```\n\n4. **Load and Use the Filter in Your Template**:\n   - In your `base.html` or any other template where you want to use this logic, first load the custom template tags.\n\n```html\n{% load user_filters %}\n\n{% if user.is_authenticated %}\n    {% if user|in_group:\"Customers\" %}\n        <!-- HTML for Customers -->\n        <button>Customer Feature</button>\n    {% elif user|in_group:\"Sellers\" %}\n        <!-- HTML for Sellers -->\n        <button>Seller Feature</button>\n    {% endif %}\n{% endif %}\n```\n\n5. **Add to Installed Apps**: Make sure that the app containing your `templatetags` is included in the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in your Django project's `settings.py`.\n\n6. **Restart the Server**: After making these changes, restart your Django development server to ensure everything is loaded correctly.\n\nThis approach keeps your code clean and allows you to easily add more groups or modify the logic as needed. By using a custom filter, you can handle more complex conditions if required in the future."
