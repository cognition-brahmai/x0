I would like to start from the end of the list, i.e., `collection[len(collection)-1]` and end at the beginning of the list, i.e., `collection[0]`. Additionally, I also want to be able to access the loop index while traversing. How can this be achieved?"

        "content": "To traverse a list in reverse order while also accessing the loop index, you can use Python's built-in functions and features. Here\u2019s a straightforward way to achieve this using the `reversed()` function along with `enumerate()`. This approach allows you to iterate over the list in reverse while keeping track of the index.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```python\ncollection = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']\n\n# Iterate over the list in reverse order with index\nfor index, value in enumerate(reversed(collection)):\n    # Calculate the original index in the collection\n    original_index = len(collection) - 1 - index\n    print(f\"Original Index: {original_index}, Value: {value}\")\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `reversed(collection)` provides an iterator that returns the elements of `collection` in reverse order.\n- `enumerate()` is used to keep track of the index in the reversed order.\n- `original_index` is computed as `len(collection) - 1 - index` to get the actual index of the item in the original list.\n\nThis way, you can traverse the list in reverse order while maintaining access to the original indices of the elements."
