However, when I select an entry that has more than one entry, I get back a DataFrame. Why does this happen? How can I ensure that I always get a DataFrame as a result? Here is the code that I'm working with:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data=range(5), index=[1, 2, 3, 3, 3])\n\nprint(type(df.loc[3]))  # Output: pandas.core.frame.DataFrame\nprint(type(df.loc[1]))  # Output: pandas.core.series.Series\n```"

        "content": "In Pandas, when you use `loc` to select rows by label, the type of object returned depends on the number of rows that match the label:\n\n- If only one row matches the label, Pandas returns a `Series` object.\n- If multiple rows match the label, Pandas returns a `DataFrame` object.\n\nThis behavior is based on the assumption that a single row is often treated as a 1-dimensional data structure (a `Series`), while multiple rows correspond to a 2-dimensional structure (a `DataFrame`).\n\nTo ensure that you always get a `DataFrame` regardless of the number of rows matching the label, you can use double square brackets `[[ ]]` to specify that you're selecting using a list of labels. This will always return a `DataFrame`, even if the list contains only one element. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data=range(5), index=[1, 2, 3, 3, 3])\n\nprint(type(df.loc[[3]]))  # Output: pandas.core.frame.DataFrame\nprint(type(df.loc[[1]]))  # Output: pandas.core.frame.DataFrame\n```\n\nBy using `df.loc[[label]]`, you are explicitly telling Pandas to return a `DataFrame`, even if only a single row matches the label."
