Lee.\n\nTo find the sum of the numerical values of the letters in his name, we can assign each letter a value corresponding to its position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, C=3, ..., Z=26) and then sum them up.\n\nFor \"Robert E. Lee\":\n- R = 18\n- O = 15\n- B = 2\n- E = 5\n- R = 18\n- T = 20\n\n- E = 5\n\n- L = 12\n- E = 5\n- E = 5\n\nNow, sum these values: \n18 + 15 + 2 + 5 + 18 + 20 + 5 + 12 + 5 + 5 = 105\n\nTherefore, the sum of the numerical values of the letters in Robert E. Lee's name is 105."
