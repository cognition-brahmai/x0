        "content": "To copy specific columns from one Excel file to another based on their header values, you can use the `pandas` library in Python. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you achieve this:\n\n1. **Install pandas and openpyxl**: Make sure you have `pandas` and `openpyxl` installed. You can install them using pip if you haven't done so already:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pandas openpyxl\n   ```\n\n2. **Read the source Excel file**: Use `pandas` to read the Excel file into a DataFrame.\n\n3. **Select the desired columns**: Filter the DataFrame based on the column headers you want to retain.\n\n4. **Write the selected columns to a new Excel file**: Use `pandas` to write the DataFrame containing the selected columns to a new Excel file.\n\nHere's a sample script to demonstrate this process:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Define the path to the source Excel file\nsource_file_path = 'source_file.xlsx'\n\n# Define the path to the destination Excel file\ndestination_file_path = 'destination_file.xlsx'\n\n# List of column headers you want to copy\ncolumns_to_copy = ['Header1', 'Header2', 'Header3']\n\n# Read the source Excel file\ndf = pd.read_excel(source_file_path)\n\n# Filter the DataFrame to select only the desired columns\nselected_columns_df = df[columns_to_copy]\n\n# Write the selected columns to a new Excel file\nselected_columns_df.to_excel(destination_file_path, index=False)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- Make sure the column names in `columns_to_copy` exactly match the headers in the Excel file, including case and any special characters.\n- The `index=False` parameter in `to_excel` ensures that the DataFrame index is not written to the Excel file.\n- If the column headers might have leading or trailing spaces, consider using `.strip()` to clean them before comparison.\n\nThis script assumes you know the headers of the columns you want to copy. If you need to determine the headers dynamically or handle different sets of headers, you may need to read the headers first and then decide which ones to keep."
