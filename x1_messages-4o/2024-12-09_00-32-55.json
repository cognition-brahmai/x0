By default, '^' matches only at the beginning of the string. However, when I try to use the \"re.sub\" function with the \"re.MULTILINE\" flag to replace all occurrences of \"//\" at the beginning of each line, it only replaces the first occurrence. Why is this happening? Here's the code I'm running:\n\n```python\nimport re\ns = \"\"\"// The quick brown fox.\n// Jumped over the lazy dog.\"\"\"\nre.sub('^//', '', s, re.MULTILINE)\n```\n\nThe result I obtain is:\n```python\n' The quick brown fox.\\n// Jumped over the lazy dog.'\n```"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is due to how the `re.sub()` function interprets its arguments. In your code, the `re.sub()` function is being called with the `count` parameter set to `re.MULTILINE`, which is not what you intend. The `re.MULTILINE` flag should be passed as an argument to the `re.compile()` function or as a third argument to `re.sub()` using the `flags` parameter. \n\nHere's how you can modify your code to correctly use the `re.MULTILINE` flag with `re.sub()`:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ns = \"\"\"// The quick brown fox.\n// Jumped over the lazy dog.\"\"\"\n\n# Use the flags parameter to specify re.MULTILINE\nresult = re.sub(r'^//', '', s, flags=re.MULTILINE)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will properly apply the `re.MULTILINE` flag, allowing the `^//` pattern to match at the beginning of each line, not just the start of the string. The output will be:\n\n```\n The quick brown fox.\n Jumped over the lazy dog.\n```\n\nBy specifying `flags=re.MULTILINE`, you ensure that `^` matches the start of each line within the string, allowing the substitution to occur at each line's beginning."
