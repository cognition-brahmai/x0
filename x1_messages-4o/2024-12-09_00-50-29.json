In Matlab, I can simply call a .m file and as long as it's not defined as anything specific, it will run as if it were part of the called code. For example, in Matlab if I have a main file \"test.m\" that calls another file \"test2.m\", when I call \"test\" it runs the code in both files. Is there a way to achieve similar behavior in Python where I can put some of my code into an external file, and it will be read as if it's in the file that it's called from?"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve similar behavior in Python by organizing your code into multiple files and using modules and imports. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Step 1: Create Python Files\n\nSuppose you have two files: `main.py` and `helper.py`.\n\n- **main.py**: This will be your main script.\n\n  ```python\n  # main.py\n  from helper import helper_function\n\n  def main():\n      print(\"This is the main file.\")\n      helper_function()\n\n  if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n      main()\n  ```\n\n- **helper.py**: This will contain the code you want to separate.\n\n  ```python\n  # helper.py\n  def helper_function():\n      print(\"This is the helper function from another file.\")\n  ```\n\n### Step 2: Import and Use the Code\n\nIn `main.py`, you can import the function `helper_function` from `helper.py` using the `import` statement. This allows you to use `helper_function` as if it were part of `main.py`.\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Modules**: Each Python file (`.py`) is a module. You can import functions, classes, and variables from one module to another.\n\n2. **Importing**: Use the `import` statement to bring in code from another module. You can import specific functions or the entire module.\n\n3. **Organizing Code**: By splitting code into different files, you can organize your code better, making it more readable and maintainable.\n\n4. **Execution**: When you run `main.py`, it will execute `helper_function` from `helper.py`, similar to how you described the behavior in MATLAB.\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- **Packages**: If you have multiple related modules, consider organizing them into a package (a directory with an `__init__.py` file).\n\n- **Relative Imports**: If your files are in different directories, you might need to use relative imports.\n\n- **Namespacing**: Be mindful of namespacing when using imports to avoid conflicts with functions or variables of the same name.\n\nBy using modules and imports, you can effectively split your Python code into multiple files and maintain a clean and organized codebase."
