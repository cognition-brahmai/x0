Here's how you can replicate your SQL query using SQLAlchemy:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import or_\n\n# Assuming AddressBook is your model and City, LastName, FirstName are columns\naddr = session.query(AddressBook).filter(\n    AddressBook.city == \"boston\",\n    or_(\n        AddressBook.lastname == \"bulger\",\n        AddressBook.firstname == \"whitey\"\n    )\n).all()\n```\n\nIn this code snippet:\n\n- `AddressBook.city == \"boston\"` is a filter for the city.\n- `or_()` is used to create the OR condition, where you check if either the last name is 'bulger' or the first name is 'whitey'.\n- The `filter()` function can take multiple conditions, and they are ANDed together by default.\n- Finally, `.all()` is used to execute the query and retrieve all matching records.\n\nMake sure to replace `AddressBook`, `city`, `lastname`, and `firstname` with the actual class and column names from your ORM model."
