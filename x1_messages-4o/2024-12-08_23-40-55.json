Firstly, there were higher costs for chicken, which impacted the overall profit margin. Secondly, the company had to increase their advertising budget to maintain customer traffic. Lastly, the price of tomatoes rose despite the decrease in their quality, which resulted in lower customer satisfaction. Can you suggest any strategies that the company could implement to address these issues and improve their revenue?"
