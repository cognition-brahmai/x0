The colors are red, blue, and green, and the sequence always starts with a red ball. However, the rules for determining the color of the next ball are not straightforward. \nThe color of the next ball depends on the sum of the values assigned to each color, where the value of red is 1, blue is 2, and green is 3. For example, if the previous three balls were red, blue, and green, the sum would be 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. If the sum is odd, the next ball will be red. If the sum is even, the next ball will be blue if the sum is divisible by 4, and green otherwise.\nWhat color will the next ball be if the previous sequence is: red, blue, green, green, blue, red, red, green, blue?"

Here's the breakdown of the sequence:\n\n- Red = 1\n- Blue = 2\n- Green = 3\n\nGiven sequence: red, blue, green, green, blue, red, red, green, blue\n\nLet's assign values to each color in the sequence:\n\n1. Red = 1\n2. Blue = 2\n3. Green = 3\n4. Green = 3\n5. Blue = 2\n6. Red = 1\n7. Red = 1\n8. Green = 3\n9. Blue = 2\n\nNow, calculate the sum:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 18\n\nNow apply the rules:\n\n- If the sum is odd, the next ball will be red.\n- If the sum is even, the next ball will be blue if the sum is divisible by 4, and green otherwise.\n\nThe sum is 18, which is even. Next, check if 18 is divisible by 4:\n\n18 \u00f7 4 = 4.5 (not divisible by 4)\n\nSince 18 is even but not divisible by 4, the next ball in the sequence will be green."
