I am running 4 blocks on one Stream Multiprocessor (SM), each block has 320 threads or 10 warps, so it's 40 warps on one SM. Given that the maximum warps on one SM is 48 (Compute Capability 2.x), the Occupancy becomes 40/48. However, I am running a total of 320 * 4 threads on one SM, and there are only 48 CUDA cores on one SM. Why isn't the occupancy 100%, given that all CUDA cores are being used?"

        "content": "CUDA Occupancy is defined in terms of the number of active warps over the maximum warps supported on a Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) because it provides a measure of how effectively the SM's resources are being utilized to hide instruction latencies. Occupancy is not a direct measure of how many CUDA cores are actively working at any given moment, but rather how well the SM can keep those cores busy with work.\n\nHere's why occupancy is defined this way:\n\n1. **Latency Hiding**: The primary purpose of having multiple warps ready to execute is to hide various types of latencies, such as memory latency. When one warp is stalled (waiting for memory, for example), another warp can be scheduled to execute. High occupancy implies more warps are available to the scheduler to keep the CUDA cores busy.\n\n2. **Scheduler Efficiency**: Each SM has a warp scheduler that selects which warp to execute next. Having a high number of active warps means the scheduler has more flexibility to choose a warp that is ready to execute, thus improving performance by reducing idle cycles.\n\n3. **Resource Constraints**: Although you have 320 threads running on an SM, other resources like registers and shared memory also affect occupancy. Each warp needs registers, and each block occupies shared memory. If your kernel uses a lot of these resources, it can limit the number of warps that can be active simultaneously, thus affecting occupancy.\n\n4. **Utilization vs. Occupancy**: Utilization refers to how much of the hardware is being used at any moment, while occupancy refers to the potential to keep the hardware busy. Even if at any point all CUDA cores are used, without high occupancy, you might not be able to maintain that utilization consistently due to waiting on data or other operations.\n\n5. **Compute Capability Considerations**: The compute capability of your GPU defines the architectural limits, such as the maximum number of threads per block, maximum number of warps, and available resources. These limits are designed to optimize the parallel execution model and ensure a balance between resource availability and execution efficiency.\n\nSo, even if you have 320 threads executing on an SM, they are organized into warps, and the scheduling and latency hiding capabilities defined by occupancy are crucial for achieving optimal performance. Occupancy allows you to evaluate how well your application is using the SM's potential to handle multiple operations concurrently, rather than just measuring raw core usage."
