Here's a simple SQL query to accomplish this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM customers\nWHERE city = 'New York';\n```\n\nThis query selects all columns for rows in the `customers` table where the `city` column has the value 'New York'. If your table structure is different, you may need to adjust the column names accordingly."
