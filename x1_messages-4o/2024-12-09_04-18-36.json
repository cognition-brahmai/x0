This function takes a single character as an argument and returns its ASCII value as an integer. Here's a simple example:\n\n```python\nchar = 'A'  # Example character\nascii_value = ord(char)\nprint(f\"The ASCII value of '{char}' is {ascii_value}.\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `ord()` function is used to get the ASCII value of the character `'A'`, which is `65`. You can replace `'A'` with any other character to get its corresponding ASCII value."
