        "content": "To design a C# class that can print out a pyramid of a given height, you can create a class with a method that generates the pyramid pattern. The pyramid consists of spaces and asterisks ('*') arranged in such a way that they form a symmetric shape. Here\u2019s a simple implementation:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\npublic class PyramidPrinter\n{\n    // Method to print the pyramid\n    public void PrintPyramid(int height)\n    {\n        if (height <= 0)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Height should be a positive integer.\");\n            return;\n        }\n\n        for (int i = 1; i <= height; i++)\n        {\n            // Print spaces\n            for (int j = 0; j < height - i; j++)\n            {\n                Console.Write(\" \");\n            }\n\n            // Print asterisks\n            for (int k = 0; k < (2 * i) - 1; k++)\n            {\n                Console.Write(\"*\");\n            }\n\n            // Move to the next line after each row\n            Console.WriteLine();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        PyramidPrinter pyramidPrinter = new PyramidPrinter();\n        \n        Console.Write(\"Enter the height of the pyramid: \");\n        int height = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());\n        \n        pyramidPrinter.PrintPyramid(height);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Class Definition**: We define a class `PyramidPrinter` which contains the method `PrintPyramid`.\n\n2. **PrintPyramid Method**:\n   - Takes an integer `height` as a parameter which denotes the number of levels in the pyramid.\n   - First, it checks if the height is a positive integer. If not, it outputs an error message.\n   - It uses two nested loops:\n     - The outer loop (`i`) controls the number of rows.\n     - The first inner loop (`j`) is used to print spaces, which ensures that the pyramid shape is symmetric.\n     - The second inner loop (`k`) prints the asterisks for each level of the pyramid.\n\n3. **Main Method**:\n   - Creates an instance of `PyramidPrinter`.\n   - Prompts the user to enter the desired height of the pyramid.\n   - Calls `PrintPyramid` with the user-provided height.\n\nThis code will output a pyramid pattern according to the specified height. For example, if the user inputs 4, the output will be:\n\n```\n   *\n  ***\n *****\n*******\n```"
