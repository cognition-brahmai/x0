The early morning light cast a soft glow over the still water, creating a peaceful atmosphere. However, the tranquility was interrupted by the loud quacking of the ducks. This cacophony was a mix of greetings and territorial calls as the ducks communicated with each other in the fresh morning air. The surrounding trees rustled gently with a light breeze, adding to the symphony of sounds that marked the beginning of a new day.\n\n**Table of Different Types of Ducks and Their Vocalizations:**\n\n| Type of Duck         | Vocalization Description  |\n|----------------------|---------------------------|\n| Mallard              | Loud quacking             |\n| Wood Duck            | High-pitched whistle      |\n| Northern Pintail     | Soft, flute-like whistle  |\n| American Black Duck  | Harsh, grating quack      |\n| Teal                 | Soft, peeping calls       |\n\n**Explanation of the Most Likely Duck Responsible for the Noise:**\n\nIn this scenario, the loud and continuous quacking likely points to Mallards, as they are known for their distinctive and boisterous quacks. Mallards are common in many wetland areas and are often seen in ponds, making them the probable source of the morning's noisy disturbance."
