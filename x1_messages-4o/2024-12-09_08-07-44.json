        "content": "In PyTorch, you can flatten a multi-dimensional tensor into a single dimension using the `torch.flatten()` function or the `view()` method. Here are both approaches:\n\n### Using `torch.flatten()`\n\nThe `torch.flatten()` function is straightforward to use. It takes a tensor as input and returns a new tensor with all dimensions flattened into one.\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\n# Example tensor\ntensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])\n\n# Flatten the tensor\nflattened_tensor = torch.flatten(tensor)\n\nprint(flattened_tensor)\n```\n\n### Using `view()`\n\nThe `view()` method can also be used to reshape a tensor into a single dimension. You need to pass `-1` as the argument to flatten the tensor.\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\n# Example tensor\ntensor = torch.tensor([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])\n\n# Flatten the tensor\nflattened_tensor = tensor.view(-1)\n\nprint(flattened_tensor)\n```\n\nBoth methods will give you a flattened tensor with a single dimension. Note that `view()` requires the tensor to be contiguous in memory, but this is usually the case unless you've performed certain operations that make it non-contiguous. If needed, you can call `tensor.contiguous()` before using `view()`."
