Here is the code snippet I'm using:\n\n```javascript\nlet tf = require(\"@tensorflow/tfjs\");\n\n(async () => {\n    try\n    {\n        const model = await tf.loadLayersModel(\"/path/to/model.json\");\n    }\n    catch(error)\n    {\n        console.error(error);\n    }\n})();\n```\n\nAre local files not supported yet with the loadLayersModel function in Tensorflow.js?"

        "content": "In TensorFlow.js, the `loadLayersModel` function indeed expects a URL, and when you're working within a Node.js environment, you need to provide an absolute path with a `file://` protocol prefix to load a model from the local filesystem. Adjust your code like this:\n\n1. Use `tfjs-node` instead of `@tensorflow/tfjs` to access the Node.js-specific functionalities, which include file system support.\n\n2. Ensure you provide an absolute path that starts with `file://`.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to work correctly in a Node.js environment:\n\n```javascript\nconst tf = require('@tensorflow/tfjs-node');\n\n(async () => {\n    try {\n        const model = await tf.loadLayersModel('file:///absolute/path/to/model.json');\n        console.log('Model loaded successfully');\n    } catch (error) {\n        console.error('Error loading the model:', error);\n    }\n})();\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- Use `@tensorflow/tfjs-node` which is optimized for Node.js and supports local file system operations.\n- Ensure your path is absolute and prefixed with `file://`.\n- Verify that the path is correct and that your server has read permissions for the file.\n\nThis setup should resolve the \"Only absolute URLs are supported\" error and allow you to successfully load your Keras model."
