        "content": "When rolling a single six-sided die, each of the six faces has an equal probability of landing face up. Therefore, the likelihood of any specific event occurring, such as rolling a particular number, can be calculated as follows:\n\nThe probability of rolling any one specific number (e.g., a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Probability} = \\frac{1}{6} \\]\n\nThis is because there is one favorable outcome out of six possible outcomes. \n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the possible outcomes and their corresponding probabilities in tabular form:\n\n| Outcome | Probability |\n|---------|-------------|\n| 1       | \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) or approximately 0.167 |\n| 2       | \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) or approximately 0.167 |\n| 3       | \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) or approximately 0.167 |\n| 4       | \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) or approximately 0.167 |\n| 5       | \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) or approximately 0.167 |\n| 6       | \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) or approximately 0.167 |\n\nEach outcome is equally likely, ensuring that the sum of probabilities for all possible outcomes equals 1."
