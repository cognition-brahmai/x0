        "content": "Using `fetchall()` to retrieve over 1 million rows can indeed be risky if your server does not have enough RAM to store all the data in memory. Loading such a large dataset at once can lead to memory exhaustion and potentially crash your server.\n\nTo handle large datasets more efficiently, you can use a cursor that fetches a limited number of rows at a time. This way, you can process the data in chunks, which is more memory-efficient. Here's how you can do it using the `fetchmany()` method:\n\n```python\nq = \"SELECT names FROM myTable;\"\ncur.execute(q)\n\nfetch_size = 1000  # Number of rows to fetch at a time\nwhile True:\n    rows = cur.fetchmany(fetch_size)\n    if not rows:\n        break\n    for row in rows:\n        doSomething(row)\n```\n\nIn this approach, `fetchmany(fetch_size)` retrieves a specified number of rows at a time, reducing memory usage and allowing you to process the data in manageable chunks. You can adjust the `fetch_size` based on your memory constraints and performance requirements.\n\nAdditionally, you can use server-side cursors (also known as named cursors) to further optimize the process and avoid loading large amounts of data into memory at once. Here's an example:\n\n```python\ncur = conn.cursor(name='my_cursor')  # Create a named cursor\ncur.execute(q)\n\nfetch_size = 1000\nwhile True:\n    rows = cur.fetchmany(fetch_size)\n    if not rows:\n        break\n    for row in rows:\n        doSomething(row)\n\ncur.close()  # Always remember to close the cursor\n```\n\nUsing a named cursor, the database server maintains the cursor state, and only a small portion of rows are fetched from the server at a time, which can be more efficient for processing large datasets."
