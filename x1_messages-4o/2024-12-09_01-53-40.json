        "content": "The error message you're encountering indicates that the `write()` method expects a string argument, but you're passing it an integer. To resolve this issue, you need to convert the integer to a string before writing it to the file. Here's how you can do that:\n\n```python\n# Example of generating some numbers and writing them to a file\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Example list of numbers\nwith open('output.txt', 'w') as outf:\n    for num in numbers:\n        outf.write(str(num) + '\\n')  # Convert num to a string and add a newline\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what this code does:\n\n1. **Convert Integer to String**: Use the `str()` function to convert each integer to a string.\n2. **Write with Newline**: Add a newline character (`'\\n'`) after each number to ensure each number appears on a new line in the file.\n3. **File Handling**: Open the file using `with open(...) as outf:` to ensure the file is properly opened and closed, and to handle exceptions more gracefully.\n\nBy converting the integers to strings, you can successfully write them to the file without encountering the `TypeError`."
