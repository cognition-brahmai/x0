All modules except one are gathered from the internet, while one is located in a folder under the one holding the requirements.txt file. This module can be easily installed with pip install. I have tried using \"file:folder/module\", \"file:./folder/module\" and \"folder/module\", but all these attempts throw an error. What is the correct way to accomplish this?"

        "content": "To use a relative path in a `requirements.txt` file to install a local tar.gz file with pip, you need to specify the path using the `file://` URL scheme. However, since you want to use a relative path, you should consider how the path is resolved relative to where pip is invoked.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can specify a relative path in your `requirements.txt`:\n\n1. **Tarball Path**: If your tar.gz file is located in a folder relative to where your `requirements.txt` file is located, you can specify it like this:\n\n   ```\n   file://./folder/module.tar.gz\n   ```\n\n   This assumes that the folder containing the tar.gz file is named `folder` and is at the same level as your `requirements.txt` file.\n\n2. **Avoiding Path Issues**: Make sure to provide the correct relative path from the location where you run the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command. If you are inside the directory containing `requirements.txt`, then using `./folder/module.tar.gz` should work. If you are one directory above, you might need to adjust the path accordingly:\n\n   ```\n   file://./<relative-path-to-folder>/module.tar.gz\n   ```\n\n3. **Example Directory Structure**:\n   ```\n   project/\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 requirements.txt\n   \u2514\u2500\u2500 folder/\n       \u2514\u2500\u2500 module.tar.gz\n   ```\n\n   In this setup, your entry in `requirements.txt` should look like this:\n\n   ```\n   file://./folder/module.tar.gz\n   ```\n\n4. **Running the Command**: Navigate to the directory where `requirements.txt` is located and run:\n\n   ```sh\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n5. **Troubleshooting**: If you encounter an error, double-check the relative path and ensure that the tar.gz file is accessible and correctly specified. Also, verify that your Python environment and pip are set up correctly.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to use a relative path to install a local tar.gz file using pip in your `requirements.txt`."
