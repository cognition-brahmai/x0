Additionally, the code should include a hover effect that changes the text color to red when the cursor is placed over it. Finally, the code should be responsive and adjust the font size to fit the screen size of different devices. Please refer to the table below for the required font size adjustments for different screen sizes.\n| Screen Size | Font Size |\n|-------------|-----------|\n| <576px      | 24pt      |\n| 576-768px   | 30pt      |\n| 769-992px   | 36pt      |\n| 993-1200px  | 42pt      |\n| >1200px     | 48pt      |"

        "content": "Certainly! To achieve the desired styling for the text \"BigText\" with responsiveness and a hover effect, you can use CSS media queries to adjust the font size according to different screen sizes. Below is the CSS code that applies these requirements:\n\n```css\n.big-text {\n  font-weight: bold;\n  font-size: 27pt; /* Default size increased by 3pt from a base of 24pt */\n  transition: color 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transition for hover effect */\n}\n\n/* Hover effect */\n.big-text:hover {\n  color: red;\n}\n\n/* Responsive font sizes */\n@media (max-width: 575px) {\n  .big-text {\n    font-size: 24pt;\n  }\n}\n\n@media (min-width: 576px) and (max-width: 768px) {\n  .big-text {\n    font-size: 30pt;\n  }\n}\n\n@media (min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 992px) {\n  .big-text {\n    font-size: 36pt;\n  }\n}\n\n@media (min-width: 993px) and (max-width: 1200px) {\n  .big-text {\n    font-size: 42pt;\n  }\n}\n\n@media (min-width: 1201px) {\n  .big-text {\n    font-size: 48pt;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Bold and Default Font Size**: The `.big-text` class initially sets the font to be bold and increases the default font size by 3pt to 27pt.\n\n2. **Hover Effect**: The text color changes to red when hovered over, with a smooth transition effect.\n\n3. **Responsive Font Sizes**: Media queries adjust the font size based on the screen width:\n   - Less than 576px: 24pt\n   - Between 576px and 768px: 30pt\n   - Between 769px and 992px: 36pt\n   - Between 993px and 1200px: 42pt\n   - Greater than 1200px: 48pt\n\nThis code will ensure that the \"BigText\" remains bold, has an increased font size by 3pt, changes color on hover, and adapts to various screen sizes as specified."
