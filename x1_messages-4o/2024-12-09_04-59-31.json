However, I'm running into an 'AttributeError: can't set attribute' when I attempt to set the value of 'x'. The code I'm using is:\n\n```python\nclass C(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._x = 0\n\n    @property\n    def x(self):\n        print 'getting'\n        return self._x\n\n    @x.setter\n    def set_x(self, value):\n        print 'setting'\n        self._x = value\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    c = C()\n    print c.x\n    c.x = 10\n    print c.x\n```\n\nThe error I'm seeing in the console reads as follows:\n\n```python\npydev debugger: starting\ngetting\n0\nFile \"\\test.py\", line 55, in &lt;module&gt;\nc.x = 10\nAttributeError: can't set attribute\n```\n\nWhat could be going wrong here? The old-style declaration seems to work fine."

        "content": "The issue you're encountering stems from a mistake in defining the setter method for the property `x`. In Python, when you use the `@property` decorator to define a property, you should use `@<property_name>.setter` to define its setter method, and the setter method should have the same name as the property. In your code, the setter method is incorrectly named `set_x` instead of `x`.\n\nHere's the corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nclass C(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._x = 0\n\n    @property\n    def x(self):\n        print('getting')\n        return self._x\n\n    @x.setter\n    def x(self, value):  # Change 'set_x' to 'x'\n        print('setting')\n        self._x = value\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    c = C()\n    print(c.x)\n    c.x = 10\n    print(c.x)\n```\n\nChanges made:\n- The setter method is renamed from `set_x` to `x` to match the property name.\n\nWith this change, your code should work correctly, and you should see \"setting\" printed when you assign a value to `c.x`."
