        "content": "Why does Python not indicate a syntax error when using a conditional expression without whitespace between the condition and the first operand? For example, \"1if True else 0\" seems to be valid Python syntax. However, if the left-hand side (LHS) is a variable, such as in the expression \"xif True else 0\", a syntax error is returned. This seems to work with other types of literals as well, like \"{'hello'}if False else 'potato'\". Is this a known or documented behavior?"

        "content": "In Python, the behavior you're observing is related to how Python's parser interprets different tokens and expressions. The key aspect here is how literals are parsed in combination with the conditional expression. \n\nWhen you write `1if True else 0`, Python interprets this as a conditional expression because `1` is a literal and can be parsed directly followed by `if`, which is part of the syntax for a conditional expression. The parser is able to recognize this pattern and correctly interpret it as `1 if True else 0`.\n\nHowever, when you use `xif True else 0`, Python expects `xif` to be a single token (possibly a variable or function name) and not a combination of `x` and the `if` statement. Since `xif` is not a valid variable name or keyword, Python raises a syntax error.\n\nThe behavior with literals extends to sets and other literals as well, as you've observed with `{'hello'}if False else 'potato'`. Since the set `{'hello'}` is a complete and valid token, the parser can handle it in conjunction with the `if` expression.\n\nThis behavior is not necessarily documented in detail in Python's official documentation because it results from the specific nuances of the parser's tokenization and parsing processes. Generally, it is good practice to include whitespace around operators and keywords to improve code readability and avoid such ambiguities."
