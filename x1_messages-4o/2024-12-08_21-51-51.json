        "content": "Certainly! Calculating the temperature of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) involves understanding the system's properties, such as the number of particles, the volume, and the interactions between particles. However, in a simplified scenario, you can calculate the critical temperature \\( T_c \\) below which a dilute gas of bosons forms a Bose-Einstein condensate. The formula for the critical temperature is:\n\n\\[ T_c = \\frac{{2\\pi \\hbar^2}}{{k_B m}} \\left( \\frac{n}{\\zeta(3/2)} \\right)^{2/3} \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( \\hbar \\) is the reduced Planck's constant,\n- \\( k_B \\) is the Boltzmann constant,\n- \\( m \\) is the mass of a boson,\n- \\( n \\) is the number density of the bosons,\n- \\( \\zeta \\) is the Riemann zeta function.\n\nHere's a simple Swift implementation to calculate the critical temperature:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nfunc criticalTemperature(mass: Double, density: Double) -> Double {\n    let hbar = 1.0545718e-34 // Reduced Planck's constant in J\u00b7s\n    let kB = 1.380649e-23 // Boltzmann constant in J/K\n    let zeta = pow(M_PI, 2) / 6 // Approximation of \u03b6(3/2)\n\n    let Tc = (2 * .pi * pow(hbar, 2) / (kB * mass)) * pow(density / zeta, 2/3)\n    return Tc\n}\n\n// Example usage\nlet massOfBoson = 1.67e-27 // Mass of a hydrogen atom in kg\nlet density = 1e20 // Example density in particles per cubic meter\nlet temperature = criticalTemperature(mass: massOfBoson, density: density)\n\nprint(\"The critical temperature for the Bose-Einstein condensate is: \\(temperature) K\")\n```\n\n### Comparison to Absolute Zero\n\n- **Absolute Zero** is defined as 0 Kelvin, the point at which entropy reaches its minimum value. At this temperature, molecular motion is minimal.\n- **Bose-Einstein Condensate Temperature** can be just a few nanokelvins above absolute zero. Although it's incredibly close to absolute zero, achieving absolute zero is theoretically impossible due to the Third Law of Thermodynamics.\n\nA BEC represents one of the coldest achievable states of matter, where quantum effects become observable on a macroscopic scale."
