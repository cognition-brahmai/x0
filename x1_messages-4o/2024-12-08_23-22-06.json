        "content": "Designing a digital coupon with a personalized QR code for each customer involves combining HTML for the structure with CSS for styling. You can use a server-side script or a service to generate QR codes dynamically. Below is a basic example of how you might set up an HTML coupon for Gourmet Grub, optimized for mobile devices:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Gourmet Grub Coupon</title>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n            margin: 0;\n            padding: 0;\n            background-color: #f8f8f8;\n        }\n        .coupon {\n            background-color: #fff;\n            border-radius: 10px;\n            box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n            margin: 20px;\n            padding: 20px;\n            text-align: center;\n            max-width: 400px;\n            margin: 20px auto;\n        }\n        .coupon h1 {\n            color: #333;\n        }\n        .logo {\n            max-width: 100px;\n            margin-bottom: 20px;\n        }\n        .qr-code {\n            margin: 20px 0;\n        }\n        .conditions {\n            font-size: 0.8em;\n            color: #555;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div class=\"coupon\">\n        <img src=\"logo.png\" alt=\"Gourmet Grub Logo\" class=\"logo\">\n        <h1>Special Offer!</h1>\n        <p>Enjoy a delicious meal delivered to your door.</p>\n        <div class=\"qr-code\">\n            <img src=\"generate_qr_code.php?customer_id=12345\" alt=\"QR Code\">\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"conditions\">\n            <p>Terms and conditions apply.</p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **HTML Structure**: The HTML consists of a simple structure with a header, logo, offer details, QR code, and terms.\n\n2. **CSS Styling**: The CSS ensures that the design is mobile-friendly with a maximum width and centered content.\n\n3. **QR Code**: The `src` of the QR code image should point to a script or service that generates QR codes dynamically. The `generate_qr_code.php?customer_id=12345` is a placeholder where `customer_id=12345` is a query parameter that should be replaced with the actual customer ID to personalize the QR code.\n\n4. **Logo and Images**: Replace `logo.png` with the actual path to the Gourmet Grub logo. Ensure that the logo is stored in a location accessible by the HTML.\n\n5. **Mobile Optimization**: The design is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes using CSS properties like `max-width` and `margin`.\n\n### Notes:\n\n- **Dynamic QR Code Generation**: To generate QR codes dynamically, you can use server-side scripts in PHP, Python, or any other language, or leverage third-party APIs.\n  \n- **Security and Privacy**: Ensure that the customer data used to generate the QR codes is handled securely and complies with privacy regulations.\n\nThis example provides a starting point, and you can further customize the design and functionality based on your specific needs and branding guidelines."
