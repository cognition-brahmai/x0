I want to split this string by spaces but ignore the spaces within the quotes. The resulting output should be ['this', 'is', 'a test']. Also, in my specific use case, there will be no quotes within the quotes."

        "content": "To achieve the desired split of a string by spaces while preserving substrings enclosed in quotes, you can use Python's `shlex` module, which is designed for simple shell-like lexical analysis. The `shlex.split()` function is particularly useful for this purpose, as it handles quoted substrings appropriately. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nimport shlex\n\n# Your input string\ninput_string = 'this is \"a test\"'\n\n# Split the string using shlex.split()\nresult = shlex.split(input_string)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n['this', 'is', 'a test']\n```\n\nThe `shlex.split()` function respects the quotes in the input string and treats the quoted part as a single token, effectively preserving the spaces within the quotes. This is exactly what you need for your use case."
