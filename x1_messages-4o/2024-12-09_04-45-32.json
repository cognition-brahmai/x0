        "content": "The issue you're encountering is likely due to a couple of reasons. Let's go through the possible causes and their solutions:\n\n1. **Python Version**: \n   - If you're using Python 2, the module is named `Tkinter` (with an uppercase 'T').\n   - If you're using Python 3, the module is named `tkinter` (with a lowercase 't').\n\n   Make sure you are using the correct naming convention based on your Python version.\n\n2. **Tkinter Not Installed**:\n   - Tkinter is a standard library in Python, but it might not be installed by default in some Python distributions. You can install it using your system's package manager.\n\n   For Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install python3-tk\n   ```\n\n   For Fedora:\n   ```bash\n   sudo dnf install python3-tkinter\n   ```\n\n   For Windows, Tkinter should be included with the standard Python installer, but if you're using a custom installation, make sure to enable the option to install Tkinter during the setup process.\n\n3. **Virtual Environment**:\n   - If you're working within a virtual environment, ensure that the virtual environment has access to Tkinter. You might need to install Tkinter within the virtual environment specifically.\n\n4. **Python Installation Issues**:\n   - If none of the above solutions work, there might be an issue with your Python installation. Consider reinstalling Python and ensuring that Tkinter is included during the installation process.\n\nAfter confirming or resolving the above, try running your script again. If you continue to experience issues, double-check your Python installation and ensure it\u2019s correctly set up to include the Tkinter library."
