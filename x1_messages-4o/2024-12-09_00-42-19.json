According to the Flask documentation, a request for the route \"/somewhere/\" will return a 404 error while \"/somewhere\" is valid. Conversely, \"/someplace/\" is valid and \"/someplace\" will redirect to \"/someplace/\". However, I would like the inverse of this behavior, that is, I want \"/someplace/\" to redirect to \"/someplace\". I understand that I can set `strict_slashes=False` on the route to get effectively the same behavior of case two in case one, but I would like to get the redirect behavior to always redirect to the URL without the trailing slash. I thought of using an error handler for 404's, but I'm wondering if there's a better solution, like a drop-in app configuration of some sort, similar to `strict_slashes=False` that I can apply globally. Is there a way to define a route to take on this behavior in Flask?\n\n```python\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route(\"/somewhere\")\ndef no_trailing_slash():\n    #case one\n\n@app.route(\"/someplace/\")\ndef with_trailing_slash():\n    #case two\n\n@app.errorhandler(404)\ndef not_found(e):\n    if request.path.endswith(\"/\") and request.path[:-1] in all_endpoints:\n        return redirect(request.path[:-1]), 302\n    return render_template(\"404.html\"), 404\n```"

        "content": "To achieve the behavior where routes without a trailing slash are the canonical URLs and requests to routes with a trailing slash are redirected to their non-trailing counterparts, you can use a custom middleware or update your route definitions to handle this manually. Unfortunately, Flask doesn't provide a built-in, global configuration option to automatically enforce this behavior out of the box. However, you can create a small middleware to handle it.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n1. **Custom Middleware**: Create a middleware to check if the request URL ends with a slash and perform the redirection.\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, redirect, request\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.before_request\ndef remove_trailing_slash():\n    # Check if the path has a trailing slash and is not the root URL\n    if request.path != '/' and request.path.endswith('/'):\n        # Redirect to the same path without the trailing slash\n        return redirect(request.path[:-1], code=302)\n\n@app.route(\"/somewhere\")\ndef no_trailing_slash():\n    return \"This is the /somewhere endpoint.\"\n\n@app.route(\"/someplace\")\ndef with_trailing_slash():\n    return \"This is the /someplace endpoint.\"\n\n@app.errorhandler(404)\ndef not_found(e):\n    return \"404 Not Found\", 404\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n2. **Route Definitions**: Ensure that your route definitions do not include the trailing slash if you want them to be accessible without it.\n\nWith the `before_request` function, every incoming request will be checked. If it ends with a slash and is not the root URL (`/`), it will be redirected to the URL without the trailing slash.\n\nThis approach keeps your application logic clean and automatically enforces the desired URL structure across all routes."
