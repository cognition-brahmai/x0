However, when I modify `E0_copy` in a loop, `E0` also changes. Why is this happening? Here is the code snippet:\n```python\nE0 = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\nfor k in range(3):\n    E0_copy = list(E0)\n    E0_copy[k][k] = 0\nprint(E0)  # -> [[0, 2, 3], [4, 0, 6], [7, 8, 0]]\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the way `list(E0)` creates a copy of the list. This operation creates a shallow copy of the list `E0`, which means that while the outer list is a new list, the inner lists (the sublists) are still references to the same objects as in the original list. Therefore, modifying these inner lists through the shallow copy affects the original list as well.\n\nTo create a deep copy of a list in Python, you can use the `copy` module, which provides the `deepcopy` function. This function will recursively copy all objects found in the original list, creating a completely independent copy.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use `deepcopy`:\n\n```python\nimport copy\n\nE0 = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\nfor k in range(3):\n    E0_copy = copy.deepcopy(E0)\n    E0_copy[k][k] = 0\nprint(E0)  # -> [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n```\n\nUsing `copy.deepcopy(E0)`, you ensure that both the outer list and all of the inner lists are completely independent copies, so modifications to `E0_copy` will not affect `E0`."
