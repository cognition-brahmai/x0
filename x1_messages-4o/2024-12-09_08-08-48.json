I'm currently using the code `message = sys.stdin.readlines()`. However, I am unable to figure out how to stop it from getting the input. When I try to stop it with ctrl+c, the whole process stops and there is no input to be saved anywhere."

        "content": "The `sys.stdin.readlines()` function in Python is designed to read all lines from the standard input until an EOF (End of File) signal is encountered. In an interactive terminal session, you can typically signal EOF by pressing `Ctrl+D` on Unix/Linux or `Ctrl+Z` followed by `Enter` on Windows. This will end the input collection phase and store the input in the `message` variable.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:\n\n1. Run your Python script that includes `message = sys.stdin.readlines()`.\n2. Enter the input lines you want to store, pressing `Enter` after each line.\n3. Once you're done entering the input, send the EOF signal:\n   - On Unix/Linux and macOS, press `Ctrl+D`.\n   - On Windows, press `Ctrl+Z` and then `Enter`.\n\nThis will cause `sys.stdin.readlines()` to stop collecting input and store all the lines entered in the `message` variable as a list of strings.\n\nHere's a quick example:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nprint(\"Enter your input (Press Ctrl+D to finish on Unix/Linux/macOS or Ctrl+Z then Enter on Windows):\")\nmessage = sys.stdin.readlines()\n\nprint(\"You entered:\")\nfor line in message:\n    print(line, end='')\n```\n\nFollow the steps above, and it should work without terminating the whole process."
