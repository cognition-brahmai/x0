Find three historical events that occurred within a time frame represented by the equation 1900 - x = y - 1875, where x and y are two numbers with x < y, and the difference between y and x is greater than 25. Additionally, the sum of these three events' year numbers should be equal to 5675. Can you provide the values of x, y, and the three historical event years using the formula: \nx = 1900 - (y - 1875)\ny - x > 25\nevent1 + event2 + event3 = 5675"
