        "content": "To partition the set \\(\\{27, 16, 25, 18, 29\\}\\) into two subsets with an equal number of elements (2 and 3 elements per subset) and minimize the absolute difference between their sums, let's go through the process step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Total Sum\nFirst, calculate the total sum of the elements in the set:\n\\[ 27 + 16 + 25 + 18 + 29 = 115 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Partition into Two Subsets\nSince the set contains 5 elements, we aim to split it into subsets of 2 and 3 elements. We will try different combinations and calculate the sum of each subset to find the one with the smallest difference.\n\n### Step 3: Try Different Combinations\nLet's try a few combinations:\n\n1. **Subset 1:** \\(\\{27, 18\\}\\), **Subset 2:** \\(\\{16, 25, 29\\}\\)\n   - Sum of Subset 1: \\(27 + 18 = 45\\)\n   - Sum of Subset 2: \\(16 + 25 + 29 = 70\\)\n   - Difference: \\(|70 - 45| = 25\\)\n\n2. **Subset 1:** \\(\\{27, 25\\}\\), **Subset 2:** \\(\\{16, 18, 29\\}\\)\n   - Sum of Subset 1: \\(27 + 25 = 52\\)\n   - Sum of Subset 2: \\(16 + 18 + 29 = 63\\)\n   - Difference: \\(|63 - 52| = 11\\)\n\n3. **Subset 1:** \\(\\{27, 29\\}\\), **Subset 2:** \\(\\{16, 18, 25\\}\\)\n   - Sum of Subset 1: \\(27 + 29 = 56\\)\n   - Sum of Subset 2: \\(16 + 18 + 25 = 59\\)\n   - Difference: \\(|59 - 56| = 3\\)\n\n4. **Subset 1:** \\(\\{16, 29\\}\\), **Subset 2:** \\(\\{27, 25, 18\\}\\)\n   - Sum of Subset 1: \\(16 + 29 = 45\\)\n   - Sum of Subset 2: \\(27 + 25 + 18 = 70\\)\n   - Difference: \\(|70 - 45| = 25\\)\n\n### Step 4: Choose the Optimal Partition\nThe optimal combination, minimizing the difference, is:\n- **Subset 1:** \\(\\{27, 29\\}\\)\n- **Subset 2:** \\(\\{16, 18, 25\\}\\)\n- The absolute difference is 3, which is less than 10.\n\nThis is the best partition we can achieve under the given conditions, minimizing the difference between the sums of subsets."
