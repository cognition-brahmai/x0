Currently, I am using the following code but it's not providing the expected output:\n\n```python\nfrom openpyxl import workbook\npath = 'C:/workbook.xlsx'\nwb = load_workbook(filename = path)\nws=wb.get_sheet_by_name('Sheet3')\n\nfor row in ws.iter_rows():\n    for cell in row:\n        if column == 'C':\n            print cell.value\n```"

        "content": "The code you provided has a couple of issues. First, `get_sheet_by_name` is deprecated; it's better to use `wb[sheet_name]` to get the worksheet. Second, the logic to check for column \"C\" is incorrect. Instead, you should iterate over the specific column directly using `iter_cols` or access the column directly using slicing.\n\nHere's a corrected version of your code using `iter_cols`:\n\n```python\nfrom openpyxl import load_workbook\n\npath = 'C:/workbook.xlsx'\nwb = load_workbook(filename=path)\nws = wb['Sheet3']\n\n# Using iter_cols to iterate over the specific column\nfor cell in ws.iter_cols(min_col=3, max_col=3, min_row=1, max_row=ws.max_row, values_only=True):\n    for value in cell:\n        print(value)\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can directly access the column using slicing:\n\n```python\nfrom openpyxl import load_workbook\n\npath = 'C:/workbook.xlsx'\nwb = load_workbook(filename=path)\nws = wb['Sheet3']\n\n# Accessing the entire column directly\nfor cell in ws['C']:\n    print(cell.value)\n```\n\nBoth methods will iterate over all the cells in column \"C\" and print their values. Make sure to replace `'Sheet3'` with the actual name of your sheet if it differs."
