I am trying to implement this R code in Python for a gradient descent with linear regression using polynomial features. I am struggling to find information on the type of orthogonal polynomial used in R's `poly` function. Any insights on this matter would be greatly appreciated."

        "content": "In R, the `poly` function is used to generate orthogonal polynomials via a process known as Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. By default, `poly` in R generates orthogonal polynomials using a method that standardizes the polynomials to have a mean of zero and a norm of one. These polynomials are not tied to classical families like Hermite, Legendre, or Chebyshev polynomials. Instead, they are generated to be orthogonal over the provided data points.\n\nWhen you try to replicate this in Python, you might want to use the `numpy.polynomial` module, specifically `numpy.polynomial.Polynomial` and the method `fit` with the `domain` and `window` parameters to emulate this orthogonalization process. However, this might not directly provide orthogonal polynomials similar to R's `poly`.\n\nHere's a simplified way to achieve similar functionality using `numpy` and `scipy`:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numpy.polynomial.polynomial import Polynomial\n\ndef gram_schmidt(X):\n    Q, R = np.linalg.qr(X)\n    return Q\n\ndef get_orthogonal_poly(x, degree):\n    X = np.vander(x, degree + 1, increasing=True)\n    Q = gram_schmidt(X)\n    return Q\n\nx = np.array([some_values])  # Replace with your data points\ndegree = 9\nX = get_orthogonal_poly(x, degree)\n```\n\nThis code snippet uses the Gram-Schmidt process to orthogonalize a Vandermonde matrix, which can give you a set of orthogonal polynomials over your data `x` similar to what R's `poly` function does.\n\nIf you specifically need to match R's output, it might be helpful to compare the coefficients and possibly adjust the scaling and centering of the polynomials to match the standardization that `poly` performs."
