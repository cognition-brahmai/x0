I've tried some code, which includes the use of a template and a serializer to create a document, then attempting to convert it to the 'doc' format. However, it is returning the document as 'json' instead of starting a file download. Here's the code I've used:\n\n```python\ndef retrieve(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n    template = webodt.ODFTemplate('test.odt')\n    queryset = Pupils.objects.get(id=kwargs['pk'])\n    serializer = StudentSerializer(queryset)\n    context = dict(serializer.data)\n    document = template.render(Context(context))\n    doc = converter().convert(document, format='doc')\n    res = HttpResponse(\n        FileWrapper(doc),\n        content_type='application/msword'\n    )\n    res['Content-Disposition'] = u'attachment; filename=\"%s_%s.zip\"' % (context[u'surname'], context[u'name'])\n    return res\n```"

        "content": "To correctly return a generated file download in Django REST Framework, you need to ensure that the response headers are set up correctly, and the content is properly handled. From the code you've provided, it looks like you're trying to generate a document and return it as a downloadable file. Here are a few suggestions to help you achieve this:\n\n1. **Ensure the Content-Type is Correct**: You're using `application/msword` which is correct for .doc files. However, make sure that the conversion process actually outputs a .doc file.\n\n2. **Use File Handling Correctly**: Make sure that the `converter().convert(document, format='doc')` returns a file-like object that `FileWrapper` can handle. If `convert` returns a path, you might need to open the file before wrapping it.\n\n3. **Check the `converter` Functionality**: Ensure that `converter().convert` is correctly converting the document to the .doc format. If something goes wrong here, you might end up with an unexpected file format.\n\n4. **Set the Proper Content-Disposition Header**: You're setting the `Content-Disposition` header to trigger a file download. Make sure the filename and extension are correct.\n\n5. **Debugging Tips**:\n   - Log or print the type of `doc` to ensure it's what you expect (a file-like object).\n   - Check the output of the conversion process to ensure the document is being converted correctly.\n\nHere's a revised version of your code with these considerations:\n\n```python\nfrom django.http import HttpResponse\nfrom wsgiref.util import FileWrapper\nimport os\n\ndef retrieve(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n    template = webodt.ODFTemplate('test.odt')\n    queryset = Pupils.objects.get(id=kwargs['pk'])\n    serializer = StudentSerializer(queryset)\n    context = dict(serializer.data)\n    document = template.render(Context(context))\n    \n    # Assume `converter().convert()` returns a path. Adjust if it returns a file-like object.\n    doc_path = converter().convert(document, format='doc')\n    \n    # Open the file in binary mode\n    with open(doc_path, 'rb') as doc_file:\n        res = HttpResponse(\n            FileWrapper(doc_file),\n            content_type='application/msword'\n        )\n        res['Content-Disposition'] = f'attachment; filename=\"{context[\"surname\"]}_{context[\"name\"]}.doc\"'\n    \n    # Optionally, remove the temporary file after use\n    os.remove(doc_path)\n    \n    return res\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n\n- **File Handling**: Open the file in binary mode (`'rb'`) when wrapped by `FileWrapper`.\n- **Temporary File Management**: If the conversion generates a temporary file, you may want to delete it afterward to avoid clutter.\n- **Ensure Proper Output**: Verify that the conversion process outputs a valid .doc file.\n\nBy ensuring each step is correctly handling the data, you should be able to return the file as a download rather than as JSON content."
