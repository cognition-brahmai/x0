I am reading the Python documentation on the 'super' keyword and it mentions that if the second argument is omitted, the super object returned is unbound. If the second argument is an object, isinstance(obj, type) must be true. If the second argument is a type, issubclass(type2, type) must be true. Can someone give me an example of passing a Type as a second argument versus passing an Object? Is the documentation referring to an instance of an object?"

        "content": "In Python, the concepts of \"Type\" and \"Object\" are fundamental, and understanding their differences is key to grasping how Python works, especially in the context of object-oriented programming.\n\n### Type vs. Object\n\n1. **Type**:\n   - A type in Python is essentially a class. It defines a blueprint for creating objects.\n   - Types describe the nature of objects and dictate what operations can be performed on them.\n   - Examples include built-in types like `int`, `str`, `list`, etc., and user-defined classes.\n\n2. **Object**:\n   - An object is an instance of a type (class).\n   - Once a type is defined, you can create objects from it, which are specific realizations or instances of that type.\n   - For example, `42` is an object of type `int`, and `\"Hello\"` is an object of type `str`.\n\n### Usage of `super()` with Type and Object\n\nThe `super()` function in Python is used to call methods from a parent class. The signature of `super()` can take up to two arguments: `super(type, obj_or_type)`.\n\n1. **Passing a Type**:\n   - When you pass a type as the second argument, the function expects that the type hierarchy of the first argument (`type`) is a subclass of the second argument (`obj_or_type`).\n   - This is useful when dealing with class methods or when you are within a class context and want to access its parent methods.\n\n   ```python\n   class A:\n       def greet(self):\n           print(\"Hello from A\")\n\n   class B(A):\n       def greet(self):\n           super(B, self).greet()  # Here, 'B' is the type\n           print(\"Hello from B\")\n\n   b = B()\n   b.greet()\n   ```\n\n2. **Passing an Object**:\n   - When you pass an object as the second argument, `super()` expects that the object is an instance of the type hierarchy up to and including the first argument (`type`).\n   - This is typically used in instance methods where you want to call a method from a parent class on the current instance.\n\n   ```python\n   class A:\n       def greet(self):\n           print(\"Hello from A\")\n\n   class B(A):\n       def greet(self):\n           super(B, self).greet()  # Here, 'self' is the object\n           print(\"Hello from B\")\n\n   b = B()\n   b.greet()\n   ```\n\nIn both examples, the `super()` function helps in accessing the `greet` method of the parent class `A` from the subclass `B`. In the first example, when `super(B, self).greet()` is called, it looks up the method resolution order (MRO) for `B` starting from `self` and finds the `greet` method in `A`.\n\nIn summary, when using `super()`:\n- If you are within an instance method, you typically pass `self` to access parent class methods for that instance.\n- If you are within a class method or need to specify a class context, you pass the class type itself as the second argument."
