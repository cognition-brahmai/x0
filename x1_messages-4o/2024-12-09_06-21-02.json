This error happens despite Python being the only active program on my computer. The code that I am using is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom PIL import Image\n\nwhile True:    \n    img_dir = r\"C:\\Users\\Harold\\Google Drive\\wallpapers\"\n    for filename in os.listdir(img_dir):\n        filepath = os.path.join(img_dir, filename)\n        im = Image.open(filepath)\n        x, y = im.size\n        totalsize = x*y\n        if totalsize < 2073600:\n            os.remove(filepath)\n```\n\nThe error message that I get is as follows:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"C:\\Users\\Harold\\Desktop\\imagefilter.py\", line 12, in <module>\n    os.remove(filepath)\nPermissionError: [WinError 32] The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process: 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Harold\\\\Google Drive\\\\wallpapers\\\\Car - ABT Audi RS6-R [OS] [1600x1060].jpg'\n```\n\nWhat could be causing this issue and how can I solve it?"

        "content": "The `PermissionError: [WinError 32]` error you are encountering is typically caused by attempting to delete a file while it is still open in your script or by another process. In your case, it seems that the image file is not being properly closed before you attempt to delete it. The `Image.open()` function opens the file, and it remains open until you close it.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you should ensure that the image file is closed before you attempt to delete it. You can do this by using a context manager (the `with` statement) to automatically close the file once you're done with it. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom PIL import Image\n\nimg_dir = r\"C:\\Users\\Harold\\Google Drive\\wallpapers\"\n\nwhile True:\n    for filename in os.listdir(img_dir):\n        filepath = os.path.join(img_dir, filename)\n        # Use a context manager to open the image\n        with Image.open(filepath) as im:\n            x, y = im.size\n            totalsize = x * y\n            if totalsize < 2073600:\n                os.remove(filepath)\n```\n\nBy using the `with` statement, the image file is automatically closed when the block inside the `with` statement is exited, ensuring that you can safely delete the file without encountering the `PermissionError`. Additionally, you should be aware that continuously running this script in an infinite loop (with `while True`) may not be necessary unless you have a specific reason for doing so."
