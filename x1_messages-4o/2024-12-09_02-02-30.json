I want to plot \"A\" and \"B\" series vs \"Date\". I tried using matplotlib's plot_date() function which works fine. However, when I try to use the fill_between() function to fill the area between the \"A\" and \"B\" series, I get a TypeError: \"ufunc 'isfinite' not supported for the input types, and the inputs could not be safely coerced to any supported types according to the casting rule ''safe'\". Does matplotlib's fill_between() function accept pandas datetime64 object? Should I convert the \"Date\" column to a different date type?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is likely due to the fact that `fill_between()` doesn't directly handle pandas `datetime64[ns]` types well. To resolve this issue, you'll need to explicitly convert the datetime column to a format that `fill_between()` can handle, such as the `matplotlib.dates` date format. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. First, ensure that your imports are correct:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.dates as mdates\n```\n\n2. Convert the \"Date\" column to a format that matplotlib can understand:\n\n```python\n# Assuming df is your DataFrame\ndf['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])\ndate_numeric = mdates.date2num(df['Date'])\n```\n\n3. Now you can plot using `fill_between()`:\n\n```python\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\n\n# Plotting the series A and B against Date\nplt.plot(df['Date'], df['A'], label='A')\nplt.plot(df['Date'], df['B'], label='B')\n\n# Filling between A and B\nplt.fill_between(date_numeric, df['A'], df['B'], where=(df['A'] > df['B']), facecolor='lightblue', alpha=0.5)\nplt.fill_between(date_numeric, df['A'], df['B'], where=(df['A'] <= df['B']), facecolor='lightcoral', alpha=0.5)\n\n# Formatting the date on x-axis\nplt.gcf().autofmt_xdate()\nplt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(mdates.DateFormatter('%Y-%m-%d'))\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlabel('Date')\nplt.ylabel('Values')\nplt.title('Plot of A and B with fill between')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis should correctly plot the series and fill the area between them. The key is converting the datetime values to a numerical format that `matplotlib` can handle using `mdates.date2num()`."
