        "content": "I'm using Python to evaluate some measured data, and sometimes an error occurs during the evaluation, usually an index error because I get out of range from the measured data. It's challenging to identify where in the code the problem is occurring. Currently, I'm using the following code:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    result = evaluateData(data)\nexcept Exception, err:\n    print (\"Error: %s.\\n\" % str(err))\n```\n\nThis only tells me that there is an index error, but I'd like to know more details about the exception like the line in code and variable, etc. to find out what happened. Is this possible?"

        "content": "Certainly! To get more detailed information about the exception, such as the line number and the traceback, you can use the `traceback` module in Python. This will help you identify exactly where the error occurred and provide more context about the exception. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport traceback\n\ntry:\n    result = evaluateData(data)\nexcept Exception as err:\n    print(\"Error: %s.\\n\" % str(err))\n    traceback.print_exc()\n```\n\nThis modification will print the full traceback of the exception, giving you information about the line number and the stack trace leading to the error. This is very helpful for debugging purposes as it pinpoints where in your code the error is occurring."
