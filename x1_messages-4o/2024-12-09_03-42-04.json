However, when I try to do the same for column \"C\", which contains strings, the sum() function doesn't work. I would like to see a list or set of strings for each group. I tried to use Series.unique() function on the grouped data, but it doesn't work. Here is the data frame I am working with:\n\n```\n   A         B       C\n0  1  0.749065    This\n1  2  0.301084      is\n2  3  0.463468       a\n3  4  0.643961  random\n4  1  0.866521  string\n5  2  0.120737       !\n```\n\nAnd this is what I would like to see:\n\n```\nA\n1    {This, string}\n2    {is, !}\n3    {a}\n4    {random}\n```\n\nAny suggestions on how I can achieve this?"

        "content": "To achieve this, you can use the `groupby` function along with `apply` to aggregate column \"C\" as a set for each group in column \"A\". Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create the DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'A': [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2],\n    'B': [0.749065, 0.301084, 0.463468, 0.643961, 0.866521, 0.120737],\n    'C': ['This', 'is', 'a', 'random', 'string', '!']\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Group by column 'A' and aggregate column 'C' as a set\nresult = df.groupby('A')['C'].apply(lambda x: set(x)).reset_index()\n\n# Display the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will give you the following output:\n\n```\n   A              C\n0  1  {This, string}\n1  2          {is, !}\n2  3             {a}\n3  4        {random}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `groupby('A')`: Groups the dataframe by column \"A\".\n- `apply(lambda x: set(x))`: For each group, it converts the strings in column \"C\" to a set, which automatically handles duplicates and provides an unordered collection.\n- `reset_index()`: Resets the index of the resulting dataframe for a cleaner output."
