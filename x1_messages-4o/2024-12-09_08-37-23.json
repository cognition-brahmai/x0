I am trying to create a script to solve an equation (as shown in the provided screenshot) using Python's math library. However, I am struggling to convert ln to log or any other usable form. The code I have written so far is:\n\n```python\nimport math\np = 100\nr = 0.06 / 12\nFV = 4000\n\nn = str(ln * ((1 + (FV * r) / p) / (ln * (1 + r))))\n\nprint (\"Number of periods = \" + str(n))\n```\n\nThe expected result for the number of periods is 36.55539635919235 but I am not getting this output. I am not allowed to use numpy for this task. Could you provide some guidance on how I can solve this problem?"

        "content": "To compute the natural logarithm (ln) in Python using the `math` library, you should use `math.log()` which calculates the natural logarithm. The confusion might arise because `math.log()` by default computes the natural logarithm, not the base-10 logarithm (which would require `math.log10()`).\n\nHere's how you could modify your code to compute the number of periods correctly:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\np = 100  # Payment amount\nr = 0.06 / 12  # Monthly interest rate\nFV = 4000  # Future value\n\n# Using math.log for natural logarithm\nn = math.log((1 + (FV * r) / p) / (1 + r)) / math.log(1 + r)\n\nprint(\"Number of periods = \" + str(n))\n```\n\nIn this formula:\n- `math.log((1 + (FV * r) / p) / (1 + r))` computes the numerator of the fraction inside the logarithm.\n- `math.log(1 + r)` calculates the denominator for the logarithm division.\n\nMake sure you have the parentheses correctly placed and you are dividing the result of the logarithms as shown. This should give you the expected result for the number of periods."
