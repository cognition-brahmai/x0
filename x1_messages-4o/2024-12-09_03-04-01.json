Django Extensions is a collection of custom management extensions for the Django framework.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this error:\n\n1. **Activate your virtual environment**: First, make sure your virtual environment is activated. You can activate it by running the following command in your terminal (replace `venv` with the name of your virtual environment directory):\n\n   - On Windows:\n     ```bash\n     .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate\n     ```\n\n   - On macOS or Linux:\n     ```bash\n     source venv/bin/activate\n     ```\n\n2. **Install Django Extensions**: Once your virtual environment is activated, you can install the Django Extensions package using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install django-extensions\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify installation**: After installing, you can verify that the package is installed by listing the installed packages:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip list\n   ```\n\n   Look for `django-extensions` in the list to confirm it's installed.\n\n4. **Add to `INSTALLED_APPS`**: Make sure that `'django_extensions'` is added to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in your Django project's `settings.py` file:\n\n   ```python\n   INSTALLED_APPS = [\n       # Other apps\n       'django_extensions',\n   ]\n   ```\n\n5. **Run the command again**: Now, try running the `python manage.py makemigrations` command again. The error should be resolved.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues, make sure that you are in the correct directory where `manage.py` is located and that your virtual environment is properly activated."
