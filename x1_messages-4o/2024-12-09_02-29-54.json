Here's a cleaner version of your script:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\nday = \"13/Oct/2013\"\nprint(\"Parsing:\", day)\n\n# Parse the input date\nmyday = datetime.strptime(day, '%d/%b/%Y')\n\n# Calculate the start and end of the week\nstart_of_week = myday - timedelta(days=myday.weekday())\nend_of_week = start_of_week + timedelta(days=6)\n\nprint(\"Start of week:\", start_of_week.strftime(\"%a, %d %b %Y\"))\nprint(\"End of week:\", end_of_week.strftime(\"%a, %d %b %Y\"))\nprint(\"Data entered:\", myday.strftime(\"%a, %d %b %Y\"))\n```\n\n### Key Improvements:\n1. **Use of `datetime.strptime`:** This function directly parses the input date string into a `datetime` object, eliminating the need to manually construct and parse strings.\n2. **`timedelta`:** This allows for straightforward arithmetic with dates, making it easy to find the start and end of the week.\n3. **`weekday()` method:** This method gives you the day of the week as an integer, which is useful for calculating the start of the week (Monday).\n\nThis version of the code is more concise and easier to understand, leveraging Python's built-in date and time handling capabilities effectively."
