        "content": "Certainly! In R, you can generate a random sequence of numbers from a uniform distribution using the `runif` function. Since you want to generate 10 numbers ranging from 1 to 100, you can use the following code:\n\n```r\n# Set the seed for reproducibility (optional)\nset.seed(123)\n\n# Generate 10 random numbers from a uniform distribution between 1 and 100\nrandom_numbers <- runif(n = 10, min = 1, max = 100)\n\n# Print the generated random numbers\nprint(random_numbers)\n```\n\nThis code will create a sequence of 10 random numbers where each number is drawn from a continuous uniform distribution between 1 and 100. If you want to ensure that the random sequence is reproducible, you can set a seed using `set.seed()`."
