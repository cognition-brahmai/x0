If I have two identical GPUs capable of running CUDA, can my kernel span these GPUs, or is it bound to one GPU? In other words, does CUDA recognize the entire set of available GPU cores, or just the ones in the GPU it is running on? If it is possible, are there any special steps or precautions I need to take to make this happen? Are there any examples beyond the CUDA SDK that might be helpful to know? I am using C/C++ as my target language."

        "content": "Running a single CUDA kernel across multiple GPUs simultaneously is not directly supported by CUDA. Each kernel launch is bound to a specific GPU. However, you can leverage multiple GPUs by distributing the workload across them manually. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n### Steps to Use Multiple GPUs:\n\n1. **Query Available GPUs:**\n   Use `cudaGetDeviceCount()` to determine the number of available GPUs on your system.\n\n2. **Set Device Context:**\n   Use `cudaSetDevice()` to specify which GPU you want subsequent CUDA operations to be executed on. You can switch between devices as needed.\n\n3. **Divide Workload:**\n   Split your data and workload into chunks that can be processed independently. Each GPU will handle a separate chunk.\n\n4. **Launch Kernels:**\n   For each GPU, set the device using `cudaSetDevice()`, allocate memory, and launch kernels. Ensure each GPU operates independently.\n\n5. **Synchronize:**\n   After processing, synchronize the GPUs using `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` to ensure all computations are complete.\n\n6. **Combine Results:**\n   Collect the results from each GPU and combine them in your host code.\n\n### Example:\nHere\u2019s a simplified example in C/C++:\n\n```c\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n#include <iostream>\n\n__global__ void myKernel(float *data, int size) {\n    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;\n    if (idx < size) {\n        data[idx] *= 2.0f;  // Example operation\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int numDevices;\n    cudaGetDeviceCount(&numDevices);\n\n    const int dataSize = 1024;\n    float *hostData = new float[dataSize];\n\n    // Initialize host data\n    for (int i = 0; i < dataSize; ++i) {\n        hostData[i] = static_cast<float>(i);\n    }\n\n    for (int device = 0; device < numDevices; ++device) {\n        cudaSetDevice(device);\n\n        float *devData;\n        cudaMalloc(&devData, dataSize * sizeof(float));\n        cudaMemcpy(devData, hostData, dataSize * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);\n\n        // Launch kernel\n        int blockSize = 256;\n        int numBlocks = (dataSize + blockSize - 1) / blockSize;\n        myKernel<<<numBlocks, blockSize>>>(devData, dataSize);\n        cudaDeviceSynchronize();\n\n        // Copy results back to host\n        cudaMemcpy(hostData, devData, dataSize * sizeof(float), cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);\n\n        cudaFree(devData);\n    }\n\n    // Process combined results on the host\n\n    delete[] hostData;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Considerations:\n\n- **Memory Allocation:** Each GPU has its own separate memory space. Allocate memory and transfer data for each GPU independently.\n- **Scalability:** Ensure your workload can be effectively divided across multiple GPUs to achieve performance gains.\n- **Synchronization:** Be cautious with synchronization to avoid data races or inconsistencies.\n- **Peer-to-Peer Communication:** If needed, enable peer-to-peer memory access between GPUs using `cudaDeviceEnablePeerAccess()` for direct data transfers.\n\n### Additional Resources:\n\n- **CUDA Samples:** Check out NVIDIA's CUDA samples repository for examples of multi-GPU programming.\n- **NVIDIA Documentation:** The official CUDA documentation provides detailed guidance on multi-GPU management.\n- **Books and Tutorials:** Books like \"CUDA by Example\" and online tutorials can offer more insights into advanced CUDA programming techniques. \n\nBy following these steps and considerations, you can effectively utilize multiple GPUs in your CUDA applications."
