While I've used Requests many times in the past without any problems, I'm now encountering an InsecurePlatform exception when I try to make https requests. The error points to urllib3, but I don't have that installed and installing it hasn't resolved the issue. The error message is as follows:\n\n```\n/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/packages/urllib3\n/util/ssl_.py:79: InsecurePlatformWarning: A true SSLContext object is not\navailable. This prevents urllib3 from configuring SSL appropriately and \nmay cause certain SSL connections to fail. For more information, see \nhttps://urllib3.readthedocs.org/en/latest  \n/security.html#insecureplatformwarning.\n```\n\nI've checked the documentation specified in the error message, but it suggests importing urllib3 and either disabling the warning or providing a certificate. Why am I getting this InsecurePlatform error and how can I fix it?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The `InsecurePlatformWarning` you're encountering is due to Python 2.7's lack of SNI (Server Name Indication) support in its SSL/TLS implementation. This is a common issue when using older versions of Python with the Requests library, as they do not provide the necessary SSL/TLS features to secure HTTPS connections properly.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Upgrade Python**: The best solution is to upgrade your Python version to 2.7.9 or later, as these versions include the necessary SSL/TLS support. However, if upgrading Python is not an option, you can try the following workaround.\n\n2. **Install `pyOpenSSL`, `ndg-httpsclient`, and `pyasn1`**: These libraries can provide the required SSL/TLS support for older Python versions. You can install them using `pip`:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pyOpenSSL ndg-httpsclient pyasn1\n   ```\n\n   After installing these packages, Python should be able to handle HTTPS requests properly with the Requests library.\n\n3. **Update the Requests Library**: Ensure that you are using the latest version of the Requests library. You can update it using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade requests\n   ```\n\n4. **Use a Virtual Environment**: Consider using a virtual environment to manage your Python packages. This can help isolate package dependencies and prevent conflicts:\n\n   ```bash\n   # Install virtualenv if not already installed\n   pip install virtualenv\n\n   # Create a new virtual environment\n   virtualenv myenv\n\n   # Activate the virtual environment\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n\n   # Install necessary packages\n   pip install requests pyOpenSSL ndg-httpsclient pyasn1\n   ```\n\n5. **Modify Your Code to Suppress Warnings (Optional)**: While not recommended, if you're unable to resolve the issue with the above steps, you can suppress the warnings by adding the following lines to your code:\n\n   ```python\n   import urllib3\n   urllib3.disable_warnings(urllib3.exceptions.InsecurePlatformWarning)\n   ```\n\n   Keep in mind that suppressing warnings is not a secure practice, as it does not address the underlying issue.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `InsecurePlatformWarning` and make secure HTTPS requests using the Requests library in your current Python environment."
