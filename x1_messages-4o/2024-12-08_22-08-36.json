The setting sun was a fiery artist, dipping below the edge of the world, leaving behind a trail of colors that danced across the heavens. Wispy clouds floated like delicate whispers, adding texture and depth to the vibrant tapestry above, as if the sky itself was exhaling a gentle sigh of day's end."
