When I encode my username and password using the `base64` `encodebytes` method, it returns the encoded value with a new line character \"\\n\" at the end. This is causing an error when I try to connect. \n\nI attempted to use the `replace` method to remove the new line character, but received the following error:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"data_consumer.py\", line 33, in <module>\n    auth_base64 = auth_base64.replace('\\n', '')\nTypeError: expected bytes, bytearray or buffer compatible object\n```\n\nHere is my code:\n\n```\nauth = b'username@domain.com:passWORD'\nauth_base64 = base64.encodebytes(auth)\nauth_base64 = auth_base64.replace('\\n', '')\n```\n\nCould anyone provide a solution to remove the new line character from the base64 encoded strings?"

        "content": "To resolve this issue, you should use the `base64.b64encode` method instead of `base64.encodebytes` to avoid the newline character altogether. The `base64.b64encode` method encodes the data without adding any newline characters, and it returns a bytes object, so you can work with it directly without the need to replace any newlines.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport base64\n\nauth = b'username@domain.com:passWORD'\nauth_base64 = base64.b64encode(auth)\n\n# If you need the result as a string, decode it\nauth_base64_str = auth_base64.decode('utf-8')\n\nprint(auth_base64_str)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `base64.b64encode` encodes the bytes and does not add any newline characters.\n- If you need the base64 encoded result as a string, you can decode it using `.decode('utf-8')`.\n\nThis should solve the issue with the newline character when establishing your HTTPS connection."
