If the strings are identical, it returns `-1` to indicate no mismatch was found.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_mismatch(str1, str2):\n    min_length = min(len(str1), len(str2))\n    \n    for i in range(min_length):\n        if str1[i] != str2[i]:\n            return i\n    \n    # If one string is longer than the other, the mismatch is at the end of the shorter one\n    if len(str1) != len(str2):\n        return min_length\n    \n    # If no mismatch is found\n    return -1\n\n# Example usage:\nstr1 = \"hello\"\nstr2 = \"heLlo\"\nmismatch_position = find_first_mismatch(str1, str2)\nif mismatch_position == -1:\n    print(\"The strings are identical.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Mismatch found at position: {mismatch_position}\")\n```\n\nThis function works by iterating through the characters of both strings up to the length of the shorter string. If a mismatch is found, it returns the index of the first mismatch. If no mismatch is found within the common length, it checks if the strings are of different lengths and returns the position at which they diverge. If the strings are identical, it returns `-1`."
