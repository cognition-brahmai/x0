        "content": "To determine the empirical formula and molecular weight of glucose, we can start with known information about glucose. Glucose is a simple sugar with a well-known molecular formula: C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086. \n\nThe empirical formula represents the simplest whole-number ratio of elements in a compound. For glucose, the molecular formula C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086 can be simplified to its empirical formula CH\u2082O, as it reflects the 1:2:1 ratio of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.\n\nRegarding the molecular weight (molar mass) of glucose, we can calculate it using the atomic masses of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O):\n- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol\n- Hydrogen (H): 1.01 g/mol\n- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol\n\nMolecular weight of glucose (C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086) = 6(12.01) + 12(1.01) + 6(16.00) = 72.06 + 12.12 + 96.00 = 180.18 g/mol\n\nSo, the empirical formula of glucose is CH\u2082O, and its molecular weight is approximately 180.18 g/mol. The energy value you mentioned (2803 kJ/mol) refers to the combustion of glucose, which releases that amount of energy per mole when completely oxidized."
