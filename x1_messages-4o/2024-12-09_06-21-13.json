The index is not strictly increasing as the dataframe is the output of a sort() operation. The index of my dataframe looks like this:\n```python\nInt64Index([171, 174,173, 172, 199..............\n        ....175, 200])\n```\nThe dataframe has 30 rows. I would like to add a column to this dataframe. The series I want to add is as follows: \n```python\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5......................., 30]\n```\nHow can I go about doing this?"

        "content": "To add a new column to your Pandas DataFrame with a series of numbers from 1 to 30, you can directly assign the list to a new column. Since your DataFrame has 30 rows and the series you want to add also contains 30 elements, you can simply do the following:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming 'df' is your existing DataFrame\n# Create the series to be added\nnew_series = list(range(1, 31))\n\n# Add the new series as a column to the DataFrame\ndf['new_column'] = new_series\n\n# Display the updated DataFrame\nprint(df)\n```\n\nThis code will add a new column named `'new_column'` to your DataFrame, with values ranging from 1 to 30, while keeping your original index intact."
