        "content": "The `math.log(x)` function in Python computes the natural logarithm (base e) of a number `x`. The domain of definition for this function is `x > 0`. This means that `x` must be a positive number, as the logarithm of zero or a negative number is undefined in the real number system.\n\nWhen `x` is very close to zero but still positive, the logarithm approaches negative infinity, which might cause issues if not handled properly in your application. If you're dealing with values of `x` in the range from 0 to 1, make sure to handle the case where `x` is zero separately. You can use a conditional check to avoid passing zero or negative numbers to `math.log(x)`:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef safe_log(x):\n    if x > 0:\n        return math.log(x)\n    else:\n        # Handle the case where x is 0 or negative\n        return float('-inf')  # Or raise an exception, return None, etc.\n\n# Example usage:\nx_values = [0.5, 0.1, 0.01, 0.0001, 0]\nlog_values = [safe_log(x) for x in x_values]\nprint(log_values)\n```\n\nIn this example, `safe_log` checks if `x` is greater than zero before attempting to compute the logarithm. If `x` is zero or negative, it returns negative infinity or handles the error in another way that makes sense for your application."
