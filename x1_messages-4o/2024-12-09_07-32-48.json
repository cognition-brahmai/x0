I have python-django installed globally and I want to create a virtual environment with a different Django version. When I run `pip -E foo install Django`, I was under the impression that it would reinstall a new version of Django, but it just finds the global package. Additionally, when I freeze the environment with `pip -E foo freeze`, it returns a list of several packages. Shouldn't this list be blank for a fresh environment with `--no-site-packages`? Have I misunderstood the usage of `--no-site-packages`?"

        "content": "It looks like you're having some confusion with the usage of `virtualenv` and `pip` for creating isolated Python environments. Let's clarify a few points:\n\n1. **`--no-site-packages` Option**: In older versions of `virtualenv`, the `--no-site-packages` flag was used to ensure that the virtual environment did not have access to the global site-packages directory. This meant that the environment would start off with no installed packages except for `pip`, `setuptools`, and `wheel`. However, as of virtualenv 1.7 (released in early 2012), `--no-site-packages` became the default behavior. So you no longer need to specify this flag to ensure isolation.\n\n2. **Creating a Virtual Environment**: To create a new virtual environment named `foo`, you should use the following command:\n   ```bash\n   virtualenv foo\n   ```\n   If you're using Python 3.3 or newer, you can use the built-in `venv` module:\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m venv foo\n   ```\n\n3. **Activating the Environment**: Before installing any packages, make sure to activate the virtual environment:\n   - On Windows:\n     ```bash\n     foo\\Scripts\\activate\n     ```\n   - On macOS/Linux:\n     ```bash\n     source foo/bin/activate\n     ```\n\n4. **Installing Packages in the Virtual Environment**: Once the environment is activated, you can install packages using `pip`. For example, to install a specific version of Django, you can run:\n   ```bash\n   pip install Django==X.Y.Z\n   ```\n   Replace `X.Y.Z` with the desired version number.\n\n5. **Checking Installed Packages**: After installing packages, you can check what is installed in the virtual environment by running:\n   ```bash\n   pip freeze\n   ```\n   If the environment was correctly set up and activated, this should only list the packages installed in the virtual environment.\n\n6. **The `-E` Option with `pip`**: The `-E` option for `pip` was deprecated and is no longer used in modern versions of `pip`. Instead, you should activate the virtual environment and then run `pip` commands as needed.\n\nIf you follow the above steps, you should be able to create an isolated environment, install a different version of Django, and only see the packages that are installed specifically in that environment. If you're still encountering issues, double-check that the environment is activated before installing or checking packages."
