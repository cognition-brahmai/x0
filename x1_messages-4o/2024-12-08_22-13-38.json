Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the list.\n2. Determine the lower and upper bounds for outliers (mean \u00b1 2 * standard deviation).\n3. Filter the list to include only values within these bounds.\n4. Calculate the mean of the filtered list.\n\nHere's how you can modify your R code to achieve this:\n\n```r\nmy_list <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 100)\n\n# Calculate the mean and standard deviation\nmean_value <- mean(my_list)\nstd_dev <- sd(my_list)\n\n# Define the lower and upper bounds\nlower_bound <- mean_value - 2 * std_dev\nupper_bound <- mean_value + 2 * std_dev\n\n# Filter the list to exclude outliers\nfiltered_list <- my_list[my_list >= lower_bound & my_list <= upper_bound]\n\n# Calculate the mean of the filtered list\nfiltered_mean <- mean(filtered_list)\n\nfiltered_mean\n```\n\nThis code will exclude any values in `my_list` that are more than 2 standard deviations away from the mean and then calculate the mean of the remaining values."
