Afterwards, I need to write these coordinates back into a different text file, but I want to maintain the right alignment as seen in the input file. Each line is composed of the coordinates like this: `line_new = words[0]  + '  ' + words[1]  + '  ' words[2]`. I am wondering if Python has a feature similar to `std::setw()` in C++ that would allow me to set the width and alignment."

        "content": "Yes, Python provides several ways to format strings and maintain alignment similar to `std::setw()` in C++. You can use the `str.format()` method or formatted string literals (f-strings) available in Python 3.6 and later. Additionally, you can use the `format()` function for more complex formatting needs. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n### Using `str.format()`\n\nYou can specify the width for each field within the curly braces:\n\n```python\nwith open('input.txt', 'r') as infile, open('output.txt', 'w') as outfile:\n    for line in infile:\n        words = line.split()\n        # Assuming there are exactly three words per line\n        line_new = \"{:>10}  {:>10}  {:>10}\\n\".format(words[0], words[1], words[2])\n        outfile.write(line_new)\n```\n\nIn this example, `{:>10}` means the text will be right-aligned in a field of width 10. You can adjust the width according to your needs.\n\n### Using f-strings (Python 3.6+)\n\nF-strings provide a more concise way to achieve the same result:\n\n```python\nwith open('input.txt', 'r') as infile, open('output.txt', 'w') as outfile:\n    for line in infile:\n        words = line.split()\n        # Assuming there are exactly three words per line\n        line_new = f\"{words[0]:>10}  {words[1]:>10}  {words[2]:>10}\\n\"\n        outfile.write(line_new)\n```\n\n### Using the `format()` function\n\nFor more advanced formatting, you can use the `format()` function directly on the variables:\n\n```python\nwith open('input.txt', 'r') as infile, open('output.txt', 'w') as outfile:\n    for line in infile:\n        words = line.split()\n        x, y, z = words\n        line_new = format(x, '>10') + '  ' + format(y, '>10') + '  ' + format(z, '>10') + '\\n'\n        outfile.write(line_new)\n```\n\nThese methods allow you to align your output consistently with the input formatting. Adjust the field width as needed to fit your specific input data."
