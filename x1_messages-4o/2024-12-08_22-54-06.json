        "content": "The given C# code utilizes a `switch` statement to perform different actions based on the value of the variable `x`. Let's break down how it works and what the expected output is.\n\n### Explanation of the `switch` statement:\n\n1. **Initialization of `x`:**  \n   The variable `x` is initialized with the value `3`.\n\n2. **Switch Statement:**  \n   The `switch` statement evaluates the expression provided in its parentheses, in this case, the value of `x`. It then compares `x` against each `case` label to find a match.\n\n3. **Case Evaluation:**  \n   - **Case 1:** The value of `x` is compared to `1`. Since `x` is `3`, this case is not executed.\n   - **Case 2:** The value of `x` is compared to `2`. Again, since `x` is `3`, this case is not executed.\n\n4. **Default Case:**  \n   Since none of the specified `case` labels match the value of `x`, the `default` case is executed. The `default` case acts as a fallback when no other `case` statements match. It is not mandatory in a `switch` statement but is often used to handle unexpected values.\n\n5. **Execution:**  \n   The code within the `default` block is executed, which is:\n   ```csharp\n   Console.WriteLine(\"Default\");\n   ```\n\n6. **Output:**  \n   Therefore, the output of this code will be:\n   ```\n   Default\n   ```\n\n### Value of `x`:\n\nThroughout the execution of this code, the value of `x` remains `3`. The `switch` statement does not alter the variable's value; it merely uses it to determine which block of code to execute.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe `switch` statement efficiently directs the program flow based on the value of `x`. In this example, since `x` did not match any of the specified `case` values (1 or 2), the `default` block was executed, resulting in the output \"Default\"."
