        "content": "To use Swift to summarize a research paper into 5 sentences, you'll need to follow a few steps. Here's a detailed explanation and example:\n\n1. **Download the Research Paper**: Use `URLSession` to download the PDF file from a URL.\n\n2. **Extract Text from PDF**: Since Swift doesn't have built-in support for PDF text extraction, you might need a third-party library like `PDFKit` or something similar to extract the text from the PDF.\n\n3. **Summarize the Text**: Implement or use an existing text summarization algorithm. This could be a simple algorithm based on sentence scoring and ranking, or you could use a machine learning model if available.\n\nHere's a more detailed example of how you might structure your code:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\nimport PDFKit // Import PDFKit for PDF text extraction\n\n// Function to download PDF and extract text\nfunc downloadAndExtractText(from url: URL, completion: @escaping (String?) -> Void) {\n    let task = URLSession.shared.downloadTask(with: url) { localURL, urlResponse, error in\n        if let localURL = localURL {\n            do {\n                let pdfDocument = PDFDocument(url: localURL)\n                var extractedText = \"\"\n                for pageIndex in 0..<pdfDocument!.pageCount {\n                    if let page = pdfDocument?.page(at: pageIndex) {\n                        if let pageText = page.string {\n                            extractedText += pageText\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n                completion(extractedText)\n            } catch {\n                print(\"Error: \\(error)\")\n                completion(nil)\n            }\n        } else {\n            print(\"Download error: \\(error?.localizedDescription ?? \"Unknown error\")\")\n            completion(nil)\n        }\n    }\n    task.resume()\n}\n\n// Simple summarization function\nfunc summarize(_ text: String, numSentences: Int) -> String {\n    let sentences = text.split(separator: \".\")\n    let summary = sentences.prefix(numSentences).joined(separator: \". \") + \".\"\n    return summary\n}\n\n// URL of the research paper\nlet paperTitle = \"A Study on the Effect of Text Messaging on Student Performance\"\nlet urlString = \"https://example.com/research_papers/\\(paperTitle).pdf\"\nif let url = URL(string: urlString) {\n    downloadAndExtractText(from: url) { extractedText in\n        if let text = extractedText {\n            let summary = summarize(text, numSentences: 5)\n            print(\"Summary: \\(summary)\")\n        } else {\n            print(\"Failed to extract text from PDF.\")\n        }\n    }\n} else {\n    print(\"Invalid URL.\")\n}\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- Use `PDFKit` to extract text from each page of the PDF.\n- Implement a simple summarization function that selects the first few sentences as a basic form of summarization.\n- You might want to explore more sophisticated summarization techniques, such as using natural language processing (NLP) libraries or APIs.\n\nThis example uses a very basic summarization approach and assumes you have access to the `PDFKit` framework, which is available on iOS and macOS. If you're targeting a different platform or need more advanced summarization, consider integrating a third-party library or service that specializes in text summarization."
