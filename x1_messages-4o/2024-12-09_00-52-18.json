I'm using the following Dockerfile:\n\n```\nFROM ubuntu:14.04\n\n# Install dependencies\nRUN apt-get update -y\nRUN apt-get install -y git curl apache2 php5 libapache2-mod-php5 php5-mcrypt php5-mysql python3.4 python-pip\n```\n\nWhen building, I get an error message saying that the command returned a non-zero code: 100. I've tried adding the `RUN \"sh\" \"-c\" \"echo nameserver 8.8.8.8 >> /etc/resolv.conf\"` line as suggested in a stack overflow answer, but the error still persists. The error message says that the system is unable to locate the `php5-mcrypt` and `python-pip` packages. Can you help me figure out what I'm doing wrong? Should I try a different version of Ubuntu?"

    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The issues you're encountering are due to the fact that Ubuntu 14.04 is quite old and some packages like `php5-mcrypt` and `python-pip` are no longer available in the default repositories. Additionally, `python-pip` for Python 3 should be `python3-pip`. Here are a few steps you can follow to resolve these issues:\n\n1. **Upgrade the Base Image**: Consider using a more recent version of Ubuntu, such as 20.04 or 22.04, which have better support for current packages.\n\n2. **Replace Deprecated Packages**: \n   - Use `php` instead of `php5`, as PHP 5 is deprecated.\n   - Use `python3-pip` instead of `python-pip`.\n\n3. **Install `mcrypt`**: The `php-mcrypt` extension has been deprecated. If you still need it, you might need to install `mcrypt` using PECL or consider alternative solutions, as it's not recommended for new projects.\n\nHere's an updated Dockerfile using Ubuntu 20.04:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM ubuntu:20.04\n\n# Avoid interactive prompts during package installation\nENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive\n\n# Install dependencies\nRUN apt-get update -y && \\\n    apt-get install -y git curl apache2 php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql python3.8 python3-pip && \\\n    apt-get clean && \\\n    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\n# Optionally, if you need mcrypt, you could add:\n# RUN apt-get install -y libmcrypt-dev && \\\n#     pecl install mcrypt-1.0.4 && \\\n#     docker-php-ext-enable mcrypt\n\n# Enable apache modules and set up permissions as needed\nRUN a2enmod rewrite\n\n# Expose port 80\nEXPOSE 80\n\n# Start apache\nCMD [\"apache2ctl\", \"-D\", \"FOREGROUND\"]\n```\n\nThis Dockerfile:\n- Uses Ubuntu 20.04.\n- Installs modern PHP and Python 3 versions.\n- Avoids deprecated packages.\n- Cleans up after installation to keep the image size small.\n\n**Notes**:\n- Adjust the Python version and PHP modules to fit your specific needs.\n- Always ensure that your base images and packages are up-to-date for security and performance."
