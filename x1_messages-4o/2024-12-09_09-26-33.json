Here's a simple Python program that counts the number of occurrences of a specific character in a given string:\n\n```python\ndef count_character_occurrences(string, character):\n    count = 0\n    for char in string:\n        if char == character:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_string = input(\"Enter the string: \")\ncharacter_to_count = input(\"Enter the character to count: \")\n\noccurrences = count_character_occurrences(input_string, character_to_count)\nprint(f\"The character '{character_to_count}' occurs {occurrences} times in the string.\")\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `count_character_occurrences` that iterates through each character in the input string and increments a counter whenever it encounters the specified character. The function then returns the total count of occurrences. You can run the program and input your own string and character to see the result."
