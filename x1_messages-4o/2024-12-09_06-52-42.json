I am currently using the 'save' method to create and store a slug when a title is inserted into the 'TodoList' table. However, I've been exploring the use of 'pre_save()' as an alternative method, but I'm not sure how to implement it. Specifically, would it be done like this?\n\n```python\ndef pre_save(self):\n    self.slug = title\n```\n\nHere is my current 'TodoList' model:\n\n```python\nclass TodoList(models.Model):\n    title = models.CharField(maxlength=100)\n    slug = models.SlugField(maxlength=100)\n    def save(self):\n        self.slug = title\n        super(TodoList, self).save()\n```\nAny guidance on how to correctly use 'pre_save()' would be greatly appreciated."

        "content": "To use the `pre_save` signal in Django for populating a field like `slug`, you need to connect a signal receiver function to the `pre_save` signal for your model. The `pre_save` signal is a hook provided by Django that is sent just before a model's `save()` method is called.\n\nHere's how you can implement it:\n\n1. **Import the necessary modules**: You'll need to import the `pre_save` signal and the `receiver` decorator from `django.db.models.signals`.\n\n2. **Define a signal receiver function**: This function will handle the population of the `slug` field.\n\n3. **Connect the signal receiver function to the `pre_save` signal**: Use the `@receiver` decorator to connect your function to the `pre_save` signal for your `TodoList` model.\n\nHere's how you can do this:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.db.models.signals import pre_save\nfrom django.dispatch import receiver\nfrom django.utils.text import slugify\n\nclass TodoList(models.Model):\n    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n    slug = models.SlugField(max_length=100, unique=True)\n\n@receiver(pre_save, sender=TodoList)\ndef populate_slug(sender, instance, **kwargs):\n    if not instance.slug:  # Check if the slug is empty\n        instance.slug = slugify(instance.title)  # Use slugify to create a slug from the title\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Use `slugify`**: The `slugify` function from `django.utils.text` is a convenient way to convert strings into slugs. It handles spaces, special characters, and ensures that the slug is URL-friendly.\n\n- **Check if slug is empty**: Before setting the slug, it's a good practice to check if the slug is already set. This prevents overwriting an existing slug if the `save()` method is called multiple times.\n\n- **Unique Slug**: Ensure that your slug field is unique if you want to avoid duplicates. This is done by setting `unique=True` in the `SlugField` definition.\n\n- **Avoid using `self` in signals**: The `pre_save` function is not a method of the model, so it doesn't use `self`. Instead, it receives the instance being saved as an argument.\n\nBy using this approach, you can automatically populate the `slug` field whenever a `TodoList` instance is saved without having to override the `save()` method."
