However, the 'updates' variable is empty in most of the examples I work with. It seems that only when we write the function in theano.scan in a specific way, we get the updates. \n\nFor example, in the following code, the updates variable is empty:\n\n```python\na = theano.shared(1)\nvalues, updates = theano.scan(fn=lambda a:a+1, outputs_info=a, n_steps=10)\n```\n\nBut in the next example, the updates variable is not empty:\n\n```python\na = theano.shared(1)\nvalues, updates = theano.scan(lambda: {a: a+1}, n_steps=10)\n```\n\nCould you please explain why in the first example the updates is empty, but in the second example, the updates variable is not empty? And more generally, how does the updates variable in theano.scan work?"

        "content": "The `theano.scan` function is a powerful construct in Theano that allows for the iteration of a sequence, applying a function repeatedly to produce a sequence of outputs. Understanding how `theano.scan` handles `updates` requires a look into how shared variables and state updates work in Theano.\n\n### The Role of `updates` in Theano\n\nIn Theano, shared variables are used to maintain state across function calls, and they can be updated. An `updates` dictionary in Theano is used to specify how shared variables should be updated after each function call. In the context of `theano.scan`, this dictionary acts similarly, specifying how shared variables should be modified after each iteration of the scan loop.\n\n### Why the `updates` Variable is Empty or Not\n\n1. **First Example:**\n\n   ```python\n   a = theano.shared(1)\n   values, updates = theano.scan(fn=lambda a: a + 1, outputs_info=a, n_steps=10)\n   ```\n\n   In this example, `theano.scan` is set up to apply the function `lambda a: a + 1` iteratively over 10 steps, starting with the initial value of `a`. Here, `outputs_info=a` specifies that `a` is the initial state passed to the scan loop. This approach generates a sequence of values but does not modify the shared variable `a` itself within the scan loop. As the lambda function does not return an update for `a`, the `updates` dictionary remains empty.\n\n2. **Second Example:**\n\n   ```python\n   a = theano.shared(1)\n   values, updates = theano.scan(lambda: {a: a + 1}, n_steps=10)\n   ```\n\n   In this example, the lambda function returns a dictionary `{a: a + 1}`. This explicitly specifies that after each iteration, the shared variable `a` should be updated to `a + 1`. As a result, `theano.scan` generates an `updates` dictionary that includes this update rule for `a`. Hence, the `updates` variable is populated with the update to `a`.\n\n### General Function of the `updates` Variable in `theano.scan`\n\n- **Updates Occur When Shared Variables Are Modified:** If the function passed to `theano.scan` specifies changes to shared variables, these changes are captured in the `updates` dictionary. This typically includes operations that change the state of shared variables over iterations.\n\n- **Explicit vs. Implicit Updates:** If the function implicitly returns new values for shared variables as part of its return dictionary, those are captured and included in `updates`. Otherwise, if the function simply calculates values without altering shared variables, the updates will be empty.\n\n- **Use Cases for Updates:** The `updates` dictionary is often used in recurrent neural networks and stateful computations where the state needs to be maintained and updated across iterations.\n\nIn summary, the presence or absence of updates in `theano.scan` depends on whether the function you pass to it explicitly modifies or updates any shared variables. If you want to update shared variables within the scan loop, you need to return a dictionary from the function that specifies these updates."
