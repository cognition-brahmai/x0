I want to run a script that uses an environment variable determined from my Python code. My code is as follows:\n\n```\nd = dict(os.environ)\nd[\"TEST_VARIABLE\"] = str(1234)\nsubprocess.Popen('/usr/bin/mybinary', env=d).wait()\n```\n\nHowever, the script seems to behave as if the variable has never been set. I have tried to test this using Python's interactive interpreter:\n\n```\nd = dict(os.environ)\nd[\"TEST_VARIABLE\"] = str(1234)\nsubprocess.Popen(['/bin/echo', '$TEST_VARIABLE'], env=d).wait() \n```\n\nThe output I'm receiving is:\n\n```\n\"$TEST_VARIABLE\"\n0\n```\n\nI assumed `env=d` should set the environment for the subprocess, but it doesn't seem to be working. Any suggestions on how to solve this?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to shell interpretation. When you run a command like `subprocess.Popen(['/bin/echo', '$TEST_VARIABLE'], env=d)`, the `$TEST_VARIABLE` is not being expanded because it's being passed directly as a string argument to `echo`, rather than being interpreted by a shell.\n\nTo resolve this, you should invoke the shell to interpret the variable. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport subprocess\n\n# Create a dictionary of the current environment variables\nd = dict(os.environ)\n\n# Set the environment variable\nd[\"TEST_VARIABLE\"] = str(1234)\n\n# Use `shell=True` and pass the command as a single string\nsubprocess.Popen('/bin/echo $TEST_VARIABLE', env=d, shell=True).wait()\n```\n\nWhen you set `shell=True`, the command is executed through the shell, which allows for shell features like variable expansion to work.\n\nKeep in mind that using `shell=True` can be a security hazard, especially if you're incorporating user input into the shell command. Always sanitize any inputs if they're coming from an untrusted source."
