        "content": "To change a sentence from passive to active voice in Excel, you can manually rewrite the sentence in the active voice in another cell. Here's how you can do it for your example:\n\n1. Identify the subject, verb, and object in the passive sentence. In your example, \"The glass was stained with fingerprints,\" the subject is \"The glass,\" the verb is \"was stained,\" and the implied doer (or agent) is someone or something responsible for the staining.\n\n2. Determine who or what performed the action. In passive sentences, the doer is often not mentioned. You might need to infer it or make an assumption. For example, \"Someone\" or \"The cleaner\" could be the doer.\n\n3. Construct the active voice sentence by placing the doer as the subject, followed by the verb, and then the object. For example, \"Someone stained the glass with fingerprints.\"\n\n4. Enter the active voice sentence into cell B1.\n\nSo, in cell B1, you could write: \"Someone stained the glass with fingerprints.\"\n\nIf you have a specific doer in mind, replace \"Someone\" with that doer for more accuracy."
