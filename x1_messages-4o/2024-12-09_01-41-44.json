        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that the `jupyter notebook` command is not correctly linked or not available in your virtual environment. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**\n   Make sure your virtual environment is activated. You can activate it using the following command:\n   ```bash\n   source /path/to/your/venv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Jupyter in the Virtual Environment:**\n   If Jupyter is not installed in your virtual environment, you need to install it. Run the following command:\n   ```bash\n   pip install jupyter\n   ```\n\n3. **Reinstall Jupyter:**\n   If Jupyter is already installed, try reinstalling it to ensure all files are correctly linked:\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall jupyter -y\n   pip install jupyter\n   ```\n\n4. **Check the PATH:**\n   Ensure that the `jupyter` command is available in your PATH. After activating the virtual environment, run:\n   ```bash\n   which jupyter\n   ```\n   This should point to the Jupyter executable in your virtual environment.\n\n5. **Troubleshoot PATH Issues:**\n   If the `which jupyter` command does not point to the virtual environment, you might need to fix your PATH. You can manually add the virtual environment's bin directory to your PATH:\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=\"/path/to/your/venv/bin:$PATH\"\n   ```\n\n6. **Check Python Version Compatibility:**\n   Ensure that the Python version in your virtual environment is compatible with the Jupyter version you are using. You might consider upgrading Python if it's possible:\n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   ```\n\n7. **Use Python 3 Kernel:**\n   Make sure the Python 3 kernel is installed for Jupyter:\n   ```bash\n   python -m ipykernel install --user\n   ```\n\n8. **Check for Missing Dependencies:**\n   Sometimes, missing dependencies can cause issues. You can upgrade pip and reinstall dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade pip\n   pip install --upgrade setuptools\n   pip install --upgrade wheel\n   ```\n\n9. **Check for Conflicting Packages:**\n   Ensure there are no conflicting or outdated packages. You can try updating all packages:\n   ```bash\n   pip list --outdated\n   pip install --upgrade [package-name]\n   ```\n\nAfter following these steps, try running `jupyter notebook` again. If the issue persists, consider checking the Jupyter logs for more detailed error messages that might provide further insight."
