        "content": "To calculate the average of a list of numbers using a class in Python, you can define a class with a method that computes the average. Here's an example of how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nclass AverageCalculator:\n    def __init__(self, numbers):\n        self.numbers = numbers\n    \n    def compute_average(self):\n        if not self.numbers:\n            return 0  # Handle the case where the list is empty\n        total_sum = sum(self.numbers)\n        count = len(self.numbers)\n        average = total_sum / count\n        return average\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\ncalculator = AverageCalculator(numbers)\naverage = calculator.compute_average()\nprint(f\"The average of the numbers is: {average}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Class Definition**: We define a class named `AverageCalculator`.\n\n2. **Initialization**: The `__init__` method initializes the class with a list of numbers.\n\n3. **Compute Average Method**: \n   - `compute_average`: This method calculates the average of the numbers.\n   - It checks if the list of numbers is empty. If it is, it returns 0 to avoid division by zero.\n   - It computes the sum of the list and counts the number of elements.\n   - Finally, it calculates the average by dividing the total sum by the count and returns the result.\n\n4. **Usage**: We create an instance of `AverageCalculator` with a list of numbers and call the `compute_average` method to get the average.\n\nThis code snippet provides a simple and effective way to encapsulate the average calculation logic within a class."
