The text file is obtained from a third party and I receive a new one daily. I get a `UnicodeDecodeError` when trying to read the file whenever a non-ascii character is encountered. The goal is to ignore the lines that contain non-ascii characters and continue reading the rest of the file. My current approach is to use a `try-except` block, but the `for` loop ends as soon as the error is encountered. How do I skip the lines causing the error and continue reading the rest of the file without having to modify the input file? Here is the code I am currently using:\n\n```python\nimport codecs\n\nfileHandle = codecs.open(\"test.csv\", encoding='utf-8')\ntry:\n    for line in fileHandle:\n        print(line, end=\"\")\nexcept UnicodeDecodeError:\n    pass\n```"

        "content": "To handle the `UnicodeDecodeError` and skip lines with non-ASCII characters while reading a file, you can modify your approach to use a `try-except` block inside the loop. This way, you can catch any decoding errors on a line-by-line basis and continue with the next line if an error occurs. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport codecs\n\nfileHandle = codecs.open(\"test.csv\", encoding='us-ascii', errors='ignore')\n\nfor line in fileHandle:\n    try:\n        print(line, end=\"\")\n    except UnicodeDecodeError:\n        # Skip the line if there is a decoding error\n        continue\n\nfileHandle.close()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Encoding and Errors Handling**:\n   - The `codecs.open()` function is used with the `us-ascii` encoding.\n   - The `errors='ignore'` parameter is used to automatically ignore any decoding errors, which means lines containing non-ASCII characters will not cause the loop to break.\n\n2. **Try-Except Inside Loop**:\n   - The `try-except` block is placed inside the loop to catch exceptions for individual lines, allowing the loop to continue to the next line if a `UnicodeDecodeError` occurs.\n\n3. **File Closure**:\n   - Ensure that the file is properly closed using `fileHandle.close()` after processing is complete to free up system resources.\n\nThis approach allows you to read and process the file without interruption, skipping lines that cannot be decoded due to non-ASCII characters."
