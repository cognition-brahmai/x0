How can I search this list to find a tuple whose number value matches a certain number? For example, if I search for the value `53`, I want it to return the index value `2`. Is there a simple method to achieve this?"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this by iterating over the list of tuples and checking for the number value within each tuple. You can use a for loop with `enumerate` to get both the index and the tuple, and then check if the number in the tuple matches your target number. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef find_index_by_number(tuples_list, target_number):\n    for index, (number, name) in enumerate(tuples_list):\n        if number == target_number:\n            return index\n    return -1  # Return -1 if the number is not found\n\n# Example usage\ntuples_list = [(1, \"juca\"), (22, \"james\"), (53, \"xuxa\"), (44, \"delicia\")]\ntarget_number = 53\nindex = find_index_by_number(tuples_list, target_number)\nprint(index)  # Output: 2\n```\n\nThis function `find_index_by_number` takes the list of tuples and the target number as inputs. It iterates through the list using `enumerate` to get both the index and the tuple elements. If it finds a match, it returns the index. If no match is found, it returns `-1`."
