I want 'a' subplots in a window, arranged such that there are 'b' subplots per column. If I have data for '2a' subplots, I want to generate 2 windows each with 'a' subplots arranged as 'b' subplots per column. The x data for all plots is the same and is of length 5, while the y data for each plot is stored in 'y_vector' in a specific way. For the first plot, data is stored at indexes 0 through 5, for the second plot, data is stored at indexes 6 through 11, and so on. For this dataset, I have a total of 91 plots. However, when I attempt to plot this, I get the error: \"'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'plot'\". How can I resolve this error and achieve the desired plot arrangement?"

        "content": "The error message \"'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'plot'\" suggests that you are trying to call the `plot` method on a NumPy array instead of a Matplotlib Axes object. To resolve this issue and achieve the desired plot arrangement, you need to ensure that you are using the Matplotlib Axes object to plot your data. Here's how you can structure your script to achieve this:\n\n1. **Import Necessary Libraries:**\n\n   Ensure you have the necessary imports:\n\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n   import numpy as np\n   ```\n\n2. **Define Parameters:**\n\n   Set up your parameters `a`, `b`, and the number of plots:\n\n   ```python\n   a = 10  # Number of subplots per window\n   b = 2   # Number of subplots per column\n   num_plots = 91\n   ```\n\n3. **Generate Data:**\n\n   Let's assume `x` and `y_vector` are already defined:\n\n   ```python\n   x = np.arange(5)\n   y_vector = np.random.rand(num_plots * 5)  # Random data for illustration\n   ```\n\n4. **Plotting Logic:**\n\n   Use a loop to create the necessary figures and subplots:\n\n   ```python\n   num_windows = (num_plots + a - 1) // a  # Calculate the number of windows needed\n\n   for window in range(num_windows):\n       fig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=(a // b), ncols=b, figsize=(10, 8))\n       axs = axs.flatten()  # Flatten the 2D array of axes to easily index\n\n       for subplot_index in range(a):\n           plot_index = window * a + subplot_index\n           if plot_index >= num_plots:\n               break\n\n           y_start_index = plot_index * 5\n           y_end_index = y_start_index + 5\n           y_data = y_vector[y_start_index:y_end_index]\n\n           axs[subplot_index].plot(x, y_data)\n           axs[subplot_index].set_title(f'Plot {plot_index + 1}')\n\n       plt.tight_layout()\n       plt.show()\n   ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **Loop through each window:** The outer loop iterates over the number of windows.\n  \n- **Create subplots:** `plt.subplots` is used to create a grid of subplots. The number of rows is determined by `a // b`.\n\n- **Flatten the axes array:** This allows you to treat the axes as a simple list, making it easier to index.\n\n- **Iterate through each subplot in the window:** The inner loop handles plotting data for each subplot in the current window.\n\n- **Check for plot limits:** Ensure you don't attempt to plot more than the available number of plots (`num_plots`).\n\n- **Plot data:** Use the `plot` method on the correct Axes object (`axs[subplot_index]`).\n\n- **Display the figure:** `plt.show()` displays the figure for each window.\n\nThis script should resolve the error and produce the desired arrangement of subplots across multiple windows."
