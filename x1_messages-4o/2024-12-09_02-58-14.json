My code works fine as I can call the sampleCuda() kernel (in the same file), call the C function launchKernel() (in another file), and call kernel() directly (in another file). However, I encounter an error when calling the __device__ function from the sampleCuda() kernel. The same function is callable in kernel(). The error I get is \"ptxas fatal: Unresolved extern function '_Z2k2i'\". How can I call the __device__ function from the sampleCuda() kernel?"

        "content": "To resolve the issue of calling a `__device__` function from a kernel located in a separate file, you need to ensure that the function is properly declared and defined in a way that the compiler can resolve it. In CUDA, `__device__` functions are inlined by default, so you typically need to have the function definitions available at compile time in the same translation unit where they're used.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to organizing your code:\n\n1. **Header File (`int2.cuh`)**:\n   - Declare the `__device__` function in this header file. This makes it visible to any file that includes this header.\n\n   ```cpp\n   // int2.cuh\n   #ifndef INT2_CUH\n   #define INT2_CUH\n\n   __device__ int k2i(int val);\n\n   #endif // INT2_CUH\n   ```\n\n2. **Device Function Implementation**:\n   - Implement the `__device__` function in a `.cu` file. This ensures that the function is compiled and can be linked correctly.\n\n   ```cpp\n   // int2.cu\n   #include \"int2.cuh\"\n\n   __device__ int k2i(int val) {\n       // Implementation of your device function\n       return val * 2; // Example implementation\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Calling the Device Function**:\n   - In your kernel where you want to use the `__device__` function (e.g., `sampleCuda`), include the header file so that the function declaration is visible.\n\n   ```cpp\n   // CUDASample.cu\n   #include \"int2.cuh\"\n\n   __global__ void sampleCuda() {\n       int val = 10;\n       int result = k2i(val); // Call the device function\n       // Use the result...\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Build Process**:\n   - Make sure that both `.cu` files are compiled and linked correctly. When using `nvcc`, make sure all source files are included in the compilation command.\n\n   ```sh\n   nvcc -o my_cuda_program CUDASample.cu int2.cu\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, the `__device__` function `k2i` will be correctly defined and accessible to any kernel that needs to use it, provided the header is included and both files are compiled together. The error \"ptxas fatal: Unresolved extern function\" typically indicates that the function definition is missing or not visible during compilation, which should be resolved by this approach."
