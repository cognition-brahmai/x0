        "content": "The development of cars over the last century has been marked by significant technological advancements, design evolution, and changes in manufacturing processes. Here's a brief overview:\n\n1. **Early 20th Century**: The automobile industry began to take shape with the introduction of mass production techniques, most notably by Henry Ford with the Model T in 1908. This era focused on making cars affordable and accessible to the general public.\n\n2. **1920s-1930s**: The automotive design started to evolve, with cars becoming more stylish and comfortable. Innovations such as hydraulic brakes, independent suspension, and more powerful engines were introduced.\n\n3. **1940s-1950s**: Post-World War II, the automotive industry experienced a boom. Cars became larger, more powerful, and featured new amenities like air conditioning and automatic transmissions. The rise of suburbia increased car ownership and the development of interstate highways.\n\n4. **1960s-1970s**: This period saw the introduction of muscle cars and a focus on performance. However, the oil crises of the 1970s shifted attention towards fuel efficiency, leading to the development of smaller, more economical cars. Safety features such as seat belts became standard.\n\n5. **1980s-1990s**: Technological advancements such as fuel injection, anti-lock brakes, and electronic stability control became prevalent. The rise of Japanese automakers introduced reliable and affordable vehicles to the global market.\n\n6. **2000s**: The focus shifted to environmental concerns, leading to the development of hybrid vehicles like the Toyota Prius. Technological integration with features such as GPS navigation, advanced audio systems, and later, smartphone connectivity, became common.\n\n7. **2010s**: The decade saw the rise of electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous driving technologies. Companies like Tesla popularized EVs, emphasizing sustainability and performance. Advanced safety features and driver-assistance systems became more sophisticated.\n\n8. **2020s**: The automotive industry continues to innovate with a focus on sustainability, connectivity, and autonomous driving. Electric vehicles are becoming more mainstream, with improvements in battery technology extending range and reducing costs. Autonomous driving technology is advancing, with several companies testing self-driving cars.\n\nOverall, the last century has seen cars transform from basic transportation tools to sophisticated, tech-laden vehicles that prioritize safety, efficiency, and sustainability."
