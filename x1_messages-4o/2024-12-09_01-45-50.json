I have tried using boto, but when I generate the necessary .boto file through the 'gsutil config -e' command, it keeps prompting me to configure authentication through the 'gcloud auth login' command. I have executed this command multiple times but it doesn't seem to solve the issue."

        "content": "To upload a file to Google Cloud Storage using Python 3, you can use the `google-cloud-storage` library, which is the official client library provided by Google for interacting with Google Cloud Storage. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you upload a file:\n\n1. **Install the Google Cloud Storage client library**:\n   First, ensure you have the library installed. You can install it using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install google-cloud-storage\n   ```\n\n2. **Set up authentication**:\n   Make sure you have the right authentication set up. The recommended way is to use a service account. Here's how to set it up:\n\n   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).\n   - Navigate to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts.\n   - Create a new service account or use an existing one.\n   - Assign it the role `Storage Admin` or a role with sufficient permissions to upload files to the bucket.\n   - Generate a JSON key for this service account and download it.\n\n3. **Authenticate using the service account key file**:\n   Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to point to your service account JSON key file:\n\n   ```bash\n   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=\"/path/to/your/service-account-file.json\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Upload the file using Python**:\n   Now you can write a Python script to upload a file to your Google Cloud Storage bucket:\n\n   ```python\n   from google.cloud import storage\n\n   def upload_to_bucket(bucket_name, source_file_name, destination_blob_name):\n       \"\"\"Uploads a file to the bucket.\"\"\"\n\n       # Initialize a client\n       storage_client = storage.Client()\n\n       # Get the bucket\n       bucket = storage_client.get_bucket(bucket_name)\n\n       # Create a blob object from the filename\n       blob = bucket.blob(destination_blob_name)\n\n       # Upload the file to a destination\n       blob.upload_from_filename(source_file_name)\n\n       print(\n           f\"File {source_file_name} uploaded to {destination_blob_name}.\"\n       )\n\n   # Define your parameters\n   bucket_name = 'your-bucket-name'\n   source_file_name = '/path/to/your/file'\n   destination_blob_name = 'your-destination-blob-name'\n\n   # Call the function\n   upload_to_bucket(bucket_name, source_file_name, destination_blob_name)\n   ```\n\nReplace `'your-bucket-name'`, `'/path/to/your/file'`, and `'your-destination-blob-name'` with your actual bucket name, source file path, and desired blob name in the bucket, respectively.\n\n5. **Run the script**:\n   Execute your Python script. It should upload the specified file to your Google Cloud Storage bucket.\n\nIf you encounter any issues, make sure your service account has the appropriate permissions and that you've set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable correctly."
