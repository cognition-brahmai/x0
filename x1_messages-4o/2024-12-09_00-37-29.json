        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"ImportError: bad magic number,\" typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the compiled `.pyc` files and the current Python interpreter version you're using. This can happen if the project was previously compiled with a different version of Python.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Delete `.pyc` Files:**\n   - Navigate to your project directory and remove all `.pyc` files. These are typically stored in `__pycache__` directories.\n   - You can find and delete them using the following command in your terminal:\n\n     ```bash\n     find . -name \"*.pyc\" -exec rm -f {} \\;\n     ```\n\n   - Alternatively, you can delete the entire `__pycache__` directories:\n\n     ```bash\n     find . -name \"__pycache__\" -type d -exec rm -r {} +\n     ```\n\n2. **Recompile the Python Files:**\n   - Once you've deleted the `.pyc` files, Python will recompile the `.py` files the next time you run your Django application.\n\n3. **Ensure Correct Python Version:**\n   - Make sure you're using the correct version of Python that the Django project requires. You can check the required version in the `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile` if available.\n   - To check your current Python version, run:\n\n     ```bash\n     python --version\n     ```\n\n   - If necessary, switch to the correct Python version using a version manager like `pyenv` or ensure your virtual environment is set up correctly.\n\n4. **Create/Activate Virtual Environment:**\n   - If you're not already using a virtual environment, it's a good practice to create one. This isolates your project's dependencies and Python version.\n   - Run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment:\n\n     ```bash\n     python -m venv env\n     source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\\Scripts\\activate`\n     ```\n\n5. **Reinstall Dependencies:**\n   - Once your virtual environment is activated, reinstall the project's dependencies to ensure compatibility:\n\n     ```bash\n     pip install -r requirements.txt\n     ```\n\n6. **Run the Django App:**\n   - After completing the above steps, try running your Django app again:\n\n     ```bash\n     python manage.py runserver\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the \"ImportError: bad magic number\" issue and successfully run your Django application."
