Is there a way to access this list of colors?"

        "content": "Yes, you can access the list of default colors that Matplotlib cycles through by using the `matplotlib.pyplot` module. Matplotlib uses a property called `prop_cycle` from the current axes to store the list of colors it cycles through when plotting lines. Here's how you can access this list of colors:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Retrieve the color cycle from the current axes\ncolor_cycle = plt.rcParams['axes.prop_cycle'].by_key()['color']\n\n# Print the list of colors\nprint(color_cycle)\n```\n\nThis will give you the list of default colors that Matplotlib uses for its color cycle. By default, these colors are:\n\n```\n['#10A37F', '#147960', '#024736', ...]\n```\n\nThese hexadecimal color codes correspond to the default color cycle Matplotlib uses, starting with blue, then orange, green, red, purple, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and cyan. You can use these colors directly for custom line plots or modify the cycle as needed."
