        "content": "To find the smallest 9-digit number that is evenly divisible by 7 and has only two non-zero digits, we need to consider a number in the form of \\(10^8 \\times a + b\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are non-zero digits. \n\nThe smallest 9-digit number is 100,000,000. We need the number to be divisible by 7, so we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n10^8 \\times a + b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(10^8 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}\\) because \\(10 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}\\) and by successive squaring, we have \\(10^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}\\), then \\(10^4 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}\\), and \\(10^8 \\equiv (4)^2 \\equiv 16 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}\\). \n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n2a + b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}\n\\]\n\nWe need to choose \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that this equation holds and both are non-zero digits. Let's start with \\(a = 1\\):\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 1 + b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}\n\\]\n\\[\n2 + b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}\n\\]\n\\[\nb \\equiv -2 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, \\(b = 5\\).\n\nLet's verify: The number would be \\(100,000,000 + 5 = 100,000,005\\).\n\nFinally, check divisibility by 7:\n\n\\[\n100,000,005 \\div 7 = 14,285,715\n\\]\n\nSince the division yields an integer, 100,000,005 is divisible by 7. Thus, the smallest 9-digit number that is evenly divisible by 7 and has only two non-zero digits is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{100000005}\n\\]"
