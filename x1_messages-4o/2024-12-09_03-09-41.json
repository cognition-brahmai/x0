The script should use a different set of configuration options depending on the computer it's being run on. How can I retrieve the name of the computer running the script in Python? Is there a standard or a third-party library that can help with this? Ideally, if the script is running on a computer named 'DARK-TOWER', I'd like to write a command like python.library.get_computer_name() and get 'DARK-TOWER' as the output."

        "content": "To retrieve the name of the computer on which a Python script is running, you can use the `socket` library, which is part of the Python Standard Library. This makes it very convenient as you don\u2019t need to install any third-party libraries. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport socket\n\ndef get_computer_name():\n    return socket.gethostname()\n\ncomputer_name = get_computer_name()\nprint(f\"The computer name is: {computer_name}\")\n```\n\nWhen you run this code on a computer named 'DARK-TOWER', the output will be:\n\n```\nThe computer name is: DARK-TOWER\n```\n\nThis method is straightforward and works well for most scenarios where you need the hostname of the computer running the script. If you require more detailed network information or need to handle edge cases, the `platform` module can also provide additional system-related information, but for just retrieving the computer name, `socket.gethostname()` is typically sufficient."
