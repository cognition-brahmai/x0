        "content": "To write a program that calculates the average grade for each student in a given list, you can use a simple approach with a list of dictionaries in Python. Each dictionary will represent a student and contain their name and a list of their grades. Then, you can iterate over this list, calculate the average for each student, and store or print the results. Here's a step-by-step guide with a sample code:\n\n1. **Define the data structure:** Create a list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains a student's name and their grades.\n\n2. **Calculate the average:** Iterate through the list, compute the average for each student, and store the result.\n\n3. **Display the result:** Print out the average grades for each student.\n\nHere's a sample code:\n\n```python\n# List of students with their respective grades\nstudents = [\n    {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"grades\": [85, 90, 78]},\n    {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"grades\": [92, 88, 84]},\n    {\"name\": \"Charlie\", \"grades\": [70, 75, 80]},\n]\n\n# Function to calculate the average grade\ndef calculate_average(grades):\n    if len(grades) == 0:\n        return 0\n    return sum(grades) / len(grades)\n\n# Iterate over each student to calculate their average grade\nfor student in students:\n    name = student[\"name\"]\n    grades = student[\"grades\"]\n    average = calculate_average(grades)\n    print(f\"The average grade for {name} is {average:.2f}\")\n\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- We use a list of dictionaries to store student data, making it easy to access each student's name and grades.\n- A helper function `calculate_average()` calculates the average of a list of grades.\n- The program iterates over the list of students, calculates the average for each, and prints the result.\n\nThis approach is simple and effective for a small to medium-sized dataset, and can easily be adapted or expanded for more complex requirements."
