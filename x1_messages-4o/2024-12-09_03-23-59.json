However, be cautious with `eval()` because it executes arbitrary code, which can be a security risk if the string content is not controlled.\n\nHere is how you can execute your function call stored in the string `myString` and print the returned full name:\n\n```python\ndef fullName(name=\"noName\", family=\"noFamily\"):\n    return name + family\n\nmyString = \"fullName(name='Joe', family='Brand')\"\n\n# Use eval to execute the function call in the string\nresult = eval(myString)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNote: In the `fullName` function, I've corrected the return statement from `name += family` to `name + family`, as `+=` modifies the variable in place and returns `None`. This ensures that the function properly concatenates the `name` and `family` and returns the result."
