My training images have a shape of (BATCH_SIZEx227x227x1) and labels have a shape of (BATCH_SIZEx7), which are numpy ndarrays provided to the model in batches via ImageDataGenerator. The loss function I'm using is tf.nn.sparse_categorical_crossentropy. However, I'm encountering an issue during the model training where the model (with batch size of 1) outputs a shape of [1, 7] and labels have a shape of [7]. I believe the issue is because sparse_categorical_crossentropy is squeezing the dimensions of my labels, which is why I can't fix the label shape, and my attempts to fix the logits shape have been unsuccessful. I have tried using np.expand_dims to fix the labels shape, but the loss function always flattens the labels. I also tried adding tf.keras.layers.Flatten() at the end of my model to get rid of the extraneous first dimension, but it didn't work. Next, I tried to use tf.keras.layers.Reshape((-1,)) to squeeze all the dimensions which resulted in a TypeError: int returned non-int (type NoneType). How can I fix the shapes of the logits and labels to match?"

        "content": "You're encountering a common issue when using `tf.nn.sparse_categorical_crossentropy` with CNNs. The function expects the labels to be a 1D array with shape `[batch_size]`, where each entry is an integer corresponding to the class index. However, your labels have a shape of `[batch_size, num_classes]`, which is typically used with one-hot encoded labels and `categorical_crossentropy`.\n\nHere's how you can resolve your issue:\n\n1. **Check Label Format**: Ensure your labels are not one-hot encoded. They should be integers representing the class index. If your labels are currently one-hot encoded, you'll need to convert them to integer labels.\n\n2. **Convert One-Hot to Sparse Labels** (if needed):\n   If your labels are one-hot encoded, convert them to integer labels using `np.argmax`:\n\n   ```python\n   import numpy as np\n\n   # Assuming labels is your one-hot encoded labels array\n   integer_labels = np.argmax(labels, axis=1)\n   ```\n\n3. **Use `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` Properly**:\n   Make sure you're using the correct loss function. `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy` is expecting shape `[batch_size]` for labels, so you don't need to expand dimensions:\n\n   ```python\n   from tensorflow.keras.losses import SparseCategoricalCrossentropy\n\n   loss_fn = SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)\n   ```\n\n4. **Ensure Model Output Shape**: Your model should output logits with the shape `[batch_size, num_classes]`. If your output shape is already `[batch_size, 7]` as you mentioned, that's correct.\n\n5. **Verify the Model Compilation**:\n   Ensure that your model is compiled with the correct loss function:\n\n   ```python\n   model.compile(optimizer='adam',\n                 loss=SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),\n                 metrics=['accuracy'])\n   ```\n\n6. **Model Architecture Adjustment**:\n   If you still encounter issues, verify the final layer of your model. It should have the correct number of units matching the number of classes:\n\n   ```python\n   model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(7))  # Assuming you have 7 classes\n   ```\n\nBy ensuring your labels are in integer form and your model's output shape matches expectations, you should be able to resolve the shape mismatch issue."
