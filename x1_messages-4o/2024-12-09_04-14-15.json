When I measure their execution times, the function with the else clause seems to execute faster regardless of whether the if condition is triggered or not. Here are the functions and their timings:\n\n```python\ndef without_else(param=False):\n    if param:\n        return 1\n    return 0\n\ndef with_else(param=False):\n    if param:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return 0\n\nfrom timeit import Timer as T\nprint(T(lambda : without_else()).repeat())\nprint(T(lambda : with_else()).repeat())\nprint(T(lambda : without_else(True)).repeat())\nprint(T(lambda : with_else(True)).repeat())\n```\n\nCan anyone confirm or explain why this is happening in detail? I am using Python 2.7.2+ on Ubuntu 11.10 64 bit."

        "content": "The observation you're making about the timing differences between the two functions using early return and an else clause in Python is intriguing and might seem counterintuitive at first. However, there are a few potential explanations for what you're experiencing:\n\n1. **Micro-benchmarking Variability**: When measuring such small snippets of code, micro-benchmarking can often lead to misleading results due to various factors like CPU load, cache effects, and other background processes that might be running on your system. The differences you're seeing might not be significant enough to draw a reliable conclusion.\n\n2. **Python Version Differences**: As you're using Python 2.7.2+, there might be slight differences in how the interpreter optimizes or handles the bytecode for these functions compared to newer versions. However, typically, the differences between using an early return and an else clause should be negligible.\n\n3. **Execution Path and Branch Prediction**: The processor's branch prediction could potentially have an impact. If the pattern of execution is predictable, the CPU might optimize for it, but again, this would usually have a negligible effect in such simple functions.\n\n4. **Bytecode Analysis**: If you inspect the bytecode generated by these functions using the `dis` module, you may see differences in the number of operations or jumps. However, Python's execution speed for these bytecode instructions is generally fast enough that such differences would not account for significant timing discrepancies.\n\n5. **Runtime Environment**: The specific environment, including the Python interpreter and system architecture, might influence the execution time, but these should not generally favor one approach over the other in a noticeable way.\n\nUltimately, the difference in execution time for such simple functions should be minimal, and any observed differences are likely due to environmental noise or the specifics of how micro-benchmarks are conducted. If precise performance is crucial, it's always good to perform multiple runs and consider using more comprehensive profiling tools."
