He is an experienced fisherman and acts as Bond's guide and ally. \n\nThough Quarrel appears only in the early to middle parts of the novel, his role is crucial for Bond's success. He helps Bond navigate the unfamiliar terrain of Crab Key, where Dr. No's lair is located. Quarrel's knowledge of the local environment and his resourcefulness provide Bond with the necessary support to infiltrate Dr. No's stronghold. Unfortunately, Quarrel meets a tragic end when he is killed by Dr. No's flamethrowing tank, known as the \"dragon,\" while trying to protect Bond and their other companion, Honeychile Rider.\n\nQuarrel's contribution to the plot is significant because he not only aids Bond in his mission but also represents the theme of loyalty and sacrifice. His death adds an emotional depth to the story and motivates Bond to seek justice for his fallen friend, driving the narrative forward."
