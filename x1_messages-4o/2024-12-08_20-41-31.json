Additionally, provide an explanation for each adverb, detailing the emotional nuances and connotations associated with each word. Use the following table to organize your findings:\n| Adverb | Emotional Nuances | Example Sentence |\n|--------|------------------|------------------|\n|        |                  |                  |\n|        |                  |                  |\n|        |                  |                  |\n|        |                  |                  |\n|        |                  |                  |\nFurthermore, use the following code to generate a graph that visualizes the emotional intensity of each adverb, based on the frequency of its usage in literature and poetry:\n```python\nimport nltk\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nadverbs = [] # insert adverbs here\n# obtain frequency distribution of adverbs\nadverb_freq = nltk.FreqDist(adverbs)\n# plot frequency distribution\nadverb_freq.plot(30, cumulative=False)\nplt.show()\n```"

However, please note that the actual frequency data would need to be computed using a suitable corpus or dataset, which is not included here:\n\n```python\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.corpus import gutenberg\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Ensure you have downloaded the necessary NLTK data files\nnltk.download('gutenberg')\nnltk.download('stopwords')\n\n# Sample text from the Gutenberg corpus for analysis\ntext = gutenberg.raw('melville-moby_dick.txt')\n\n# Tokenize the text and filter out stopwords\ntokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)\nfiltered_tokens = [word.lower() for word in tokens if word.isalpha() and word.lower() not in stopwords.words('english')]\n\n# List of adverbs to analyze\nadverbs = ['mournfully', 'despairingly', 'woefully', 'sorrowfully', 'grievously']\n\n# Obtain frequency distribution of adverbs\nadverb_freq = nltk.FreqDist(word for word in filtered_tokens if word in adverbs)\n\n# Plot frequency distribution\nadverb_freq.plot(title='Frequency Distribution of Sadness-Related Adverbs')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis code will give you a visual representation of how often each of these adverbs appears in the selected literature, which can provide insight into their emotional intensity and usage."
