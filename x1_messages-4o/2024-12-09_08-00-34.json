        "content": "To sum a tensor over its columns in PyTorch, you can use the `torch.sum()` function and specify the dimension along which you want to perform the sum. For a tensor of size `[10, 100]`, you want to sum over the columns (i.e., along dimension 1) to get a tensor of size `[10]`.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\n# Assuming `tensor` is your tensor of size [10, 100]\ntensor = torch.randn(10, 100)  # Example tensor\n\n# Sum over columns (dimension 1)\nresult = torch.sum(tensor, dim=1)\n\n# `result` will be of size [10]\nprint(result)\n```\n\nIn this code, `torch.sum(tensor, dim=1)` computes the sum along the specified dimension (columns in this case), resulting in a tensor of size `[10]`."
