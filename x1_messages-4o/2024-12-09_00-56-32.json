I have seen solutions using dictionaries, but my arrays are large and filled with both positive and negative floats. I believe it wouldn't be efficient to load all these values into a dictionary. I have tried the following function, where NDV is GDAL's no data value and array is a numpy array:\n\n```python\ndef replaceNoData(scanBlock, NDV):\n    for n, i in enumerate(array):\n        if i == NDV:\n            scanBlock[n] = numpy.nan\n```\n\nHowever, numpy requires that I use any() or all(). I understand that I need to iterate element wise but I hope that a built-in function can achieve this. Should I perhaps use a masked array?"

        "content": "To efficiently replace a specific number with `NaN` in a NumPy array without looping through each element manually, you can use NumPy's vectorized operations. This will be much faster and more efficient, especially for large arrays. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef replace_no_data(array, NDV):\n    # Create a mask where the condition is true\n    mask = (array == NDV)\n    # Use the mask to set the selected elements to NaN\n    array[mask] = np.nan\n    return array\n\n# Example usage\narray = np.array([1.0, 2.0, -9999.0, 4.0, -9999.0])\nNDV = -9999.0\n\nresult = replace_no_data(array, NDV)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis function uses a boolean mask to identify the positions in the array where the value is equal to `NDV`, and then it replaces those positions with `NaN`. This approach avoids explicit loops and is more efficient for large arrays.\n\nIf you'd prefer to use masked arrays, you can do so as follows:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef replace_no_data_with_masked_array(array, NDV):\n    # Create a masked array where NDV is masked\n    masked_array = np.ma.masked_equal(array, NDV)\n    # Fill masked values with NaN\n    filled_array = masked_array.filled(np.nan)\n    return filled_array\n\n# Example usage\narray = np.array([1.0, 2.0, -9999.0, 4.0, -9999.0])\nNDV = -9999.0\n\nresult = replace_no_data_with_masked_array(array, NDV)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nIn this case, `np.ma.masked_equal` creates a masked array where all occurrences of `NDV` are masked, and `filled` is used to replace masked values with `NaN`. This approach is also efficient and can be useful if you plan to perform further operations where the mask is beneficial."
