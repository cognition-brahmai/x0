        "content": "When you remove the log file with `os.remove()`, the file descriptor that the `logging` module is using becomes invalid, which is why logging stops working. Instead of removing the file, you can truncate it to clear its content without affecting the file descriptor.\n\nHere's how you can clear the log file without disrupting the logging:\n\n1. Open the log file in write mode and truncate it. This will clear the file's contents while keeping the file itself intact.\n\n2. Ensure that the logger is properly configured to handle the file after it has been truncated.\n\nHere's a code snippet to illustrate this:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\ndef setup_logger(log_file):\n    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n    \n    # Create a file handler\n    handler = logging.FileHandler(log_file)\n    handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n    \n    # Create a logging format\n    formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n    handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n    \n    # Add the file handler to the logger\n    logger.addHandler(handler)\n    \n    return logger\n\ndef clear_log_file(log_file):\n    # Open the log file in write mode to truncate its contents\n    with open(log_file, 'w'):\n        pass\n\n# Usage example\nlog_file = 'server.log'\nlogger = setup_logger(log_file)\n\n# Log some messages\nlogger.debug('This is a debug message.')\nlogger.info('This is an info message.')\n\n# Clear the log file\nclear_log_file(log_file)\n\n# Log more messages after clearing\nlogger.debug('This is another debug message after clearing the log.')\nlogger.info('This is another info message after clearing the log.')\n```\n\nIn this example, the `clear_log_file` function opens the log file in write mode, which truncates its contents without deleting the file itself. This way, the logging file handler continues to work as expected, and you can keep logging messages after clearing the file."
