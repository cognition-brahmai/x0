The narrative should include details on the bear's actions that indicate its awareness of my presence.\nHere is a sample Ruby code that you can use to generate the narrative:\nbear_distance = 10\nencounter_description = \"I was walking in the forest when I suddenly saw a black bear approximately #{bear_distance} feet away. The bear noticed my presence and stopped what it was doing to stare directly at me. Its ears perked up and it stood on its hind legs to get a better view. I slowly backed away while keeping my eyes on the bear, and thankfully it didn't approach me. It eventually lost interest and went back to foraging for food.\"\nputs encounter_description\nYou can customize the distance and the encounter description to fit your specific situation."

        "content": "Certainly! Below is a Ruby code snippet that generates a first-person narrative of an encounter with a black bear in the forest. You can further customize the narrative by adjusting the details or adding more elements to fit the desired tone and context:\n\n```ruby\n# Define the distance to the bear\nbear_distance = 10\n\n# Create a narrative of the encounter\nencounter_description = <<~NARRATIVE\n  As I wandered through the serene forest, I suddenly caught sight of a majestic black bear, merely #{bear_distance} feet away. The bear's dark eyes locked onto mine, signaling its awareness of my presence. With a subtle twitch of its ears, it paused and rose onto its hind legs, towering above the forest floor to get a clearer look at me. My heart raced as I maintained a calm demeanor, slowly retreating while never breaking eye contact. Thankfully, the bear seemed more curious than threatened. After a moment that felt like an eternity, it huffed softly, lowered itself, and resumed its search for berries and roots, allowing me to continue my hike, albeit with a renewed respect for the wild.\nNARRATIVE\n\n# Output the narrative\nputs encounter_description\n```\n\nYou can modify the `bear_distance` or the text within the `encounter_description` variable to better match your desired scenario or to add more vivid imagery and emotions. This narrative sets a scene that conveys both tension and respect for the natural environment."
