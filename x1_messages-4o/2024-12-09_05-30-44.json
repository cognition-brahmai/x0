The decorated function may have positional arguments, but the functions the decorator will call can only accept keyword arguments. I'm looking for a way to convert these positional arguments into keyword arguments, and I already know how to get a list of the variable names of the decorated function as shown below:\n\n```python\ndef a(one, two=2):\n    pass\n\na.func_code.co_varnames\n# outputs: ('one', 'two')\n```\n\nHowever, I can't figure out how to determine what was passed in positionally and what was passed as a keyword. My decorator is currently structured as follows:\n\n```python\nclass mydec(object):\n    def __init__(self, f, *args, **kwargs):\n        self.f = f\n\n    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        hozer(**kwargs)\n        self.f(*args, **kwargs)\n```\n\nIs there another way to do this other than just comparing kwargs and co_varnames, adding to kwargs anything not found there, and hoping for the best?"

        "content": "To achieve your goal of converting positional arguments to keyword arguments for your decorator, you can use the `inspect` module, which provides several useful functions to get information about the arguments of a function. Here's how you could modify your `mydec` class to accomplish this:\n\n1. Use `inspect.signature` to obtain the signature of the function being decorated.\n2. Use this signature to bind the provided arguments (both positional and keyword) to the function's parameters, and then use this binding to convert positional arguments to keyword arguments.\n\nHere's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nimport inspect\n\ndef hozer(**kwargs):\n    # Example function that just prints the keyword arguments\n    print(\"Hozer called with:\", kwargs)\n\nclass mydec(object):\n    def __init__(self, f):\n        self.f = f\n        self.sig = inspect.signature(f)\n\n    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        # Bind the arguments to the function's signature\n        bound_args = self.sig.bind(*args, **kwargs)\n        # Convert bound arguments to a dictionary\n        bound_args.apply_defaults()\n        all_kwargs = bound_args.arguments\n\n        # Call the other function using keyword arguments\n        hozer(**all_kwargs)\n\n        # Call the original function with the same arguments\n        return self.f(*args, **kwargs)\n\n@mydec\ndef a(one, two=2):\n    print(\"Function a called with:\", one, two)\n\n# Example usage:\na(1, two=3)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`inspect.signature(f)`**: This gets the signature of the function `f`, which includes information about its parameters.\n- **`sig.bind(*args, **kwargs)`**: This binds the given positional and keyword arguments to the parameters in the function's signature. It creates a `BoundArguments` object.\n- **`bound_args.apply_defaults()`**: This populates any missing arguments with their default values (if they have any).\n- **`bound_args.arguments`**: This is an `OrderedDict` containing all the arguments as keyword arguments, allowing you to easily pass them to other functions that only accept keyword arguments.\n\nBy using this approach, you can ensure that all arguments are correctly mapped to their corresponding parameter names, regardless of whether they were originally passed as positional or keyword arguments."
