I've installed Python 3.2 using the 64bits .dmg installer and managed to configure the Python interpreter successfully. However, I encounter an issue when I try to import Set using `from sets import Set`. The system throws an `ImportError: No module named sets`. This error persists when I try it from the command line too. I've noticed that the sets.py file is missing from the lib folder in my python3 directory (`/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.2/lib/python3.2/`). I've tried copying the 2.7 sets.py to the 3.2 directory but it doesn't seem to work. How can I resolve this?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is because the `sets` module was removed in Python 3. The `Set` class from the `sets` module was deprecated in Python 2.6 and removed in Python 3. Instead, Python 3 includes a built-in set type, which you should use.\n\nHere's how you can work with sets in Python 3:\n\n```python\n# Creating a set\nmy_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n\n# Alternatively, you can use the set() constructor\nmy_set = set([1, 2, 3, 4])\n\n# Adding an element to a set\nmy_set.add(5)\n\n# Removing an element from a set\nmy_set.remove(4)\n\n# Set operations like union, intersection, difference can be performed\nset_a = {1, 2, 3}\nset_b = {3, 4, 5}\n\n# Union\nunion_set = set_a | set_b  # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\n# Intersection\nintersection_set = set_a & set_b  # {3}\n\n# Difference\ndifference_set = set_a - set_b  # {1, 2}\n```\n\nIn Python 3, you should use the built-in `set` type for any set operations you need to perform. It provides all the functionality that was available in the old `Set` class and more. If you're following a tutorial or book that uses `from sets import Set`, be aware that it is likely written for an older version of Python, and you should adapt the examples to use the built-in `set` in Python 3."
