        "content": "Certainly! To find the 3rd highest value in a list of integers, we can use a straightforward approach with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. The algorithm involves iterating through the list and keeping track of the top three highest values encountered so far. Here\u2019s how you can implement this:\n\n1. **Initialize Three Variables:** Start by initializing three variables to hold the first, second, and third highest values. These can be set to negative infinity (or a very small number) to ensure any number in the list will be larger initially.\n\n2. **Iterate Through the List:** Traverse each element in the list and update the three variables accordingly:\n   - If the current element is greater than the first highest, update all three: move the first to second, and the second to third, then assign the current element to the first highest.\n   - Else if the current element is greater than the second highest, update the second and third: move the second to third, and assign the current element to the second highest.\n   - Else if the current element is greater than the third highest, update the third highest.\n\n3. **Return the Third Highest Value:** After iterating through the list, the third highest variable will contain the desired value.\n\nHere's the Python code for this algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef find_third_highest(nums):\n    if len(nums) < 3:\n        raise ValueError(\"List must contain at least three distinct elements.\")\n        \n    first = second = third = float('-inf')\n    \n    for num in nums:\n        if num > first:\n            third = second\n            second = first\n            first = num\n        elif num > second:\n            third = second\n            second = num\n        elif num > third:\n            third = num\n    \n    return third\n\n# Example usage:\nnums = [-3, 0, 5, 9, -5, 10]\nthird_highest = find_third_highest(nums)\nprint(f\"The third highest value is: {third_highest}\")\n```\n\n**Edge Cases:**\n- Ensure that the list has at least three distinct elements, otherwise, the concept of a \"third highest\" doesn't apply. You may want to handle duplicates explicitly or raise an error if there are not enough distinct numbers.\n\nThis code will efficiently find the third highest number in a list, even if the list contains negative numbers or is very large."
