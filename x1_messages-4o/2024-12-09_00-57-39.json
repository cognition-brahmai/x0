        "content": "The warning message \"W602 deprecated form of raising exception\" is indicating that the syntax you're using to raise exceptions is outdated. The deprecated form is:\n\n```python\nraise ExceptionType, argument\n```\n\nInstead, you should use the new syntax which is more consistent with the rest of Python's exception handling. Here's how you can update your code:\n\n```python\nif CONDITION == True:\n    raise ValueError(HELPING_EXPLANATION)\n```\n\nThis change involves using parentheses to pass the arguments to the exception. It also aligns with the way exceptions are defined and instantiated, making your code more readable and compatible with current Python standards. Make sure to update all instances in your code where exceptions are raised in the deprecated manner."
