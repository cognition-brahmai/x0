I have noticed that `cross_validation.KFold()` has a shuffling flag, but it is not stratified. Meanwhile, `cross_validation.StratifiedKFold()` does not have a shuffling option, and `cross_validation.StratifiedShuffleSplit()` does not produce disjoint folds. Is there something I'm overlooking? Is there any plan to include this feature?"

        "content": "As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, scikit-learn does not have a built-in method that directly combines both shuffling and stratified k-fold cross-validation into a single function. However, you can achieve this by using a combination of existing tools in scikit-learn.\n\nYou are correct in your observations:\n- `KFold` has a shuffle option but is not stratified.\n- `StratifiedKFold` is stratified but does not have a shuffle option.\n- `StratifiedShuffleSplit` provides shuffled splits but is not designed to create disjoint k-folds.\n\nTo achieve shuffled stratified k-fold cross-validation, you can use the following workaround:\n\n1. **Manually Shuffle the Data:** First, shuffle your dataset manually before applying `StratifiedKFold`. This can be done using `numpy` or `pandas`.\n\n2. **Use StratifiedKFold:** After shuffling, use `StratifiedKFold` to ensure that the splits are stratified.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Assuming X and y are your features and labels\nX, y = np.array(X), np.array(y)\n\n# Shuffle the data\nindices = np.arange(X.shape[0])\nnp.random.seed(42)  # For reproducibility\nnp.random.shuffle(indices)\nX, y = X[indices], y[indices]\n\n# Apply StratifiedKFold\nn_splits = 5\nskf = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=n_splits)\n\nfor train_index, test_index in skf.split(X, y):\n    X_train, X_test = X[train_index], X[test_index]\n    y_train, y_test = y[train_index], y[test_index]\n    # Your model training and evaluation here\n\n```\n\nRegarding future plans, scikit-learn is an actively developed library, and new features are added regularly based on community feedback and contributions. If this feature is essential for your work, you might consider checking the latest documentation or contributing to the library with a feature request or implementation."
