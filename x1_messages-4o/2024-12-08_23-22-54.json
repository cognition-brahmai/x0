Each field is required, and the Email field includes email validation:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Contact Form</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <form action=\"#\" method=\"post\">\n        <label for=\"name\">Name:</label><br>\n        <input type=\"text\" id=\"name\" name=\"name\" required><br><br>\n        \n        <label for=\"email\">Email:</label><br>\n        <input type=\"email\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\" required><br><br>\n        \n        <label for=\"message\">Message:</label><br>\n        <textarea id=\"message\" name=\"message\" rows=\"4\" cols=\"50\" required></textarea><br><br>\n        \n        <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\">\n    </form>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`<form>`**: This is the main container for the form elements. The `action` attribute specifies where to send the form data when it is submitted. In this example, it's set to `\"#\"`, meaning it does nothing, but you can replace it with a URL where the form data should be sent.\n- **`<label>`**: This element is used to define labels for the input fields, improving accessibility.\n- **`<input type=\"text\">`**: For the Name field. It is marked as `required` to ensure the user fills it out before submission.\n- **`<input type=\"email\">`**: For the Email field. It is marked as `required`, and the type `email` ensures that the input is validated as an email address.\n- **`<textarea>`**: For the Message field. It is also marked as `required`.\n- **`<input type=\"submit\">`**: The submit button for the form.\n\nFeel free to customize the form and styling as needed!"
