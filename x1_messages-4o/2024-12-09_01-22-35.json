For example, given the following list:\n\n```python\narray = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n```\nI want to generate:\n```python\nresult = [12, 15, 18] # [1+4+7, 2+5+8, 3+6+9]\n```\nSo far, I've managed to achieve this with the following function:\n```python\ndef add_list(array):\n    number_items = len(array[0])\n    result = [0] * number_items\n    for index in range(number_items):\n        for line in array:\n            result[index] += line[index]\n    return result\n```\nHowever, I'm not sure if this is the most efficient or \"Pythonic\" way of doing it. I am also not checking if all the \"lines\" in the 2D array are of the same length and can be added to each other. Is there a better way to perform this operation?"

        "content": "Your current solution works well, but there are a few ways to make it more \"Pythonic\" and slightly more efficient. One approach is to use list comprehensions along with the `zip` function, which is a concise and idiomatic way to handle such operations in Python. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef add_list(array):\n    # Ensure all sublists are of the same length\n    if not all(len(sublist) == len(array[0]) for sublist in array):\n        raise ValueError(\"All sublists must be of the same length\")\n\n    # Use zip to pair elements and sum them\n    result = [sum(elements) for elements in zip(*array)]\n    return result\n\n# Example usage\narray = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\nresult = add_list(array)\nprint(result)  # Output: [12, 15, 18]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`zip(*array)`**: The `zip` function with the unpacking operator (`*`) transposes the 2D list, effectively grouping the corresponding elements from each sublist together. For your example, this will create an iterator that yields `(1, 4, 7)`, `(2, 5, 8)`, and `(3, 6, 9)`.\n\n2. **`sum(elements)`**: For each tuple produced by `zip`, the `sum` function calculates the total, resulting in a new list where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements from the original sublists.\n\n3. **Error Checking**: The added check ensures that all sublists have the same length, raising a `ValueError` if they don't, which is a good practice to prevent unexpected behavior.\n\nThis solution is efficient and leverages Python's built-in functions to make the code cleaner and more readable."
