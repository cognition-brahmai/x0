I'm currently searching through a text file in read-only mode using file.readline(), but once I find a specific line, I want to pass the file pointer to a method. This method expects the file pointer to be at the start of that line, not right after it. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To achieve this, you can use the `tell()` and `seek()` methods provided by Python's file objects. The `tell()` method returns the current position of the file pointer, and the `seek()` method allows you to move the file pointer to a specific position. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n1. Use `tell()` to store the position of the file pointer before you call `readline()`.\n2. After reading the line, if you decide that you need to \"undo\" the operation, use `seek()` to move the file pointer back to the stored position.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```python\n# Open the file in read mode\nwith open('yourfile.txt', 'r') as file:\n    while True:\n        # Store the current position\n        position = file.tell()\n        \n        # Read a line from the file\n        line = file.readline()\n        \n        # Break the loop if end of file is reached\n        if not line:\n            break\n        \n        # Check if this is the line you're interested in\n        if \"specific text\" in line:\n            # Move the file pointer back to the beginning of this line\n            file.seek(position)\n            \n            # Now you can pass the file object to your method\n            your_method(file)\n            \n            # Break the loop if you only want to process the first occurrence\n            break\n```\n\nIn this example, `your_method(file)` will receive the file pointer at the start of the line containing \"specific text\". This way, the method can read from the beginning of that line as needed."
