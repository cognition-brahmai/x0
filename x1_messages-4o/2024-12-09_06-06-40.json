I'm currently trying to read a web page into a string and want to split the string into a list at newline characters. However, I'm encountering a syntax error 'EOL while scanning string literal' when I try to use a newline as the argument in `split()`. When I type in the characters `\\` and `n`, I get a Unicode error. How can I resolve this?"

        "content": "To split a string on newline characters in Python 3, you can use the `splitlines()` method, which is specifically designed for this purpose. It handles different types of newline characters automatically, making it especially useful when dealing with strings that may have been created on different operating systems.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use `splitlines()`:\n\n```python\n# Assume 'web_page_content' is the string containing the web page content\nweb_page_content = \"\"\"This is line one.\nThis is line two.\nThis is line three.\"\"\"\n\n# Use splitlines() to split the string at newline characters\nlines = web_page_content.splitlines()\n\n# Print the list of lines\nprint(lines)\n```\n\n`splitlines()` will split the string at every newline character and return a list of lines. It will work correctly on both Windows and other operating systems without requiring you to specify the newline character explicitly.\n\nIf you're encountering a syntax error with the string, make sure your string literals are correctly defined. For example, if you're embedding newline characters directly in a string, you should use triple quotes (`\"\"\"` or `'''`) to define a multi-line string, or ensure that your single-line string syntax is correct.\n\nIf you're still facing issues with Unicode errors, make sure your string data is correctly encoded and decoded. If the data is coming from a web page, ensure that you're handling the encoding properly. Here's an example of reading a web page with proper encoding:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# Fetch the web page content\nresponse = requests.get('http://example.com')\nweb_page_content = response.text  # This will handle the encoding automatically\n\n# Split the content into lines\nlines = web_page_content.splitlines()\n\n# Print the list of lines\nprint(lines)\n```\n\nThis approach should help you avoid syntax and Unicode errors while splitting the string into lines."
