        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"ValueError: Can't handle mix of multiclass and continuous,\" suggests that there's a misunderstanding in how accuracy is being calculated for a regression problem. In regression tasks, you predict continuous values, not discrete classes, so accuracy is not the appropriate metric. Accuracy is typically used for classification problems where you predict discrete labels.\n\nFor regression tasks, you should use different metrics to evaluate the performance of your model. Common metrics for regression include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (coefficient of determination). Here's how you can change your code to evaluate the performance of your `SGDRegressor`:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import SGDRegressor\nfrom sklearn import metrics as ms\n\nmsk = np.random.rand(len(beers)) < 0.8\n\ntrain = beers[msk]\ntest = beers[~msk]\n\nX = train[['Price', 'Net price', 'Purchase price', 'Hour', 'Product_id', 'product_group2']]\ny = train[['Quantity']]\ny = y.values.ravel()\n\nX_test = test[['Price', 'Net price', 'Purchase price', 'Hour', 'Product_id', 'product_group2']]\ny_test = test[['Quantity']]\ny_test = y_test.values.ravel()\n\nclf = SGDRegressor(max_iter=2000)\nclf.fit(X, y)\npredictions = clf.predict(X_test)\n\n# Evaluate the performance using regression metrics\nmae = ms.mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions)\nmse = ms.mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)\nr2 = ms.r2_score(y_test, predictions)\n\nprint(\"Mean Absolute Error:\", mae)\nprint(\"Mean Squared Error:\", mse)\nprint(\"R-squared:\", r2)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Use Regression Metrics**: Switched from `accuracy_score` (which is for classification) to `mean_absolute_error`, `mean_squared_error`, and `r2_score` for regression evaluation.\n\n2. **Matrix Conversion**: Updated `as_matrix()` to `values` to be compatible with newer versions of pandas.\n\nBy using these metrics, you'll get a better understanding of the performance of your regression model."
