Here is the command I am running:\n\n```python\nsubprocess.call(shlex.split(\n            \"\"\"/usr/local/itms/bin/iTMSTransporter -m lookupMetadata \n              -apple_id %s -destination %s\"\"\"%(self.apple_id, self.destination))\n)\n```\n\nI want to suppress all output from this command. I have tried using the redirection operator (`>`) to send the output to `/dev/null` like so: `subprocess.call(shlex.split(<command> > /dev/null 2&1))`, but it didn't suppress the output as expected. How can I modify my command to suppress all output?"

        "content": "To suppress all output from a subprocess command in Python, you can redirect both the standard output (`stdout`) and standard error (`stderr`) to `subprocess.DEVNULL`. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\nimport shlex\n\nsubprocess.call(\n    shlex.split(\n        \"\"\"/usr/local/itms/bin/iTMSTransporter -m lookupMetadata \n        -apple_id %s -destination %s\"\"\" % (self.apple_id, self.destination)\n    ),\n    stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL,\n    stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`subprocess.DEVNULL`**: This special value can be used to discard output by redirecting it to `/dev/null`. This is equivalent to sending output to `> /dev/null 2>&1` in a shell.\n- **`stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL`**: Redirects the standard output of the subprocess to `/dev/null`.\n- **`stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL`**: Redirects the standard error of the subprocess to `/dev/null`.\n\nThis setup ensures that both the standard output and standard error are suppressed, and nothing will be printed to the terminal."
