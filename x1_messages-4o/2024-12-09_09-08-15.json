        "content": "Creating a JavaScript class to represent a point in two-dimensional space with methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division involves defining a class with properties for the coordinates of the point and methods for the desired operations. Below is an example of how you might implement such a class:\n\n```javascript\nclass Point {\n  constructor(x, y) {\n    this.x = x;\n    this.y = y;\n  }\n\n  // Method to add another point to this point\n  add(point) {\n    return new Point(this.x + point.x, this.y + point.y);\n  }\n\n  // Method to subtract another point from this point\n  subtract(point) {\n    return new Point(this.x - point.x, this.y - point.y);\n  }\n\n  // Method to multiply this point by another point (element-wise)\n  multiply(point) {\n    return new Point(this.x * point.x, this.y * point.y);\n  }\n\n  // Method to divide this point by another point (element-wise)\n  divide(point) {\n    if (point.x === 0 || point.y === 0) {\n      throw new Error(\"Division by zero is not allowed.\");\n    }\n    return new Point(this.x / point.x, this.y / point.y);\n  }\n\n  // Method to display the point as a string\n  toString() {\n    return `(${this.x}, ${this.y})`;\n  }\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconst point1 = new Point(3, 4);\nconst point2 = new Point(1, 2);\n\nconst addedPoints = point1.add(point2);\nconsole.log(`Added: ${addedPoints.toString()}`); // Outputs: Added: (4, 6)\n\nconst subtractedPoints = point1.subtract(point2);\nconsole.log(`Subtracted: ${subtractedPoints.toString()}`); // Outputs: Subtracted: (2, 2)\n\nconst multipliedPoints = point1.multiply(point2);\nconsole.log(`Multiplied: ${multipliedPoints.toString()}`); // Outputs: Multiplied: (3, 8)\n\ntry {\n  const dividedPoints = point1.divide(point2);\n  console.log(`Divided: ${dividedPoints.toString()}`); // Outputs: Divided: (3, 2)\n} catch (error) {\n  console.error(error.message);\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Constructor**: Initializes a point with `x` and `y` coordinates.\n- **add() Method**: Adds the coordinates of another point to this point and returns a new `Point` instance.\n- **subtract() Method**: Subtracts the coordinates of another point from this point and returns a new `Point` instance.\n- **multiply() Method**: Multiplies the coordinates of this point by another point's coordinates and returns a new `Point` instance.\n- **divide() Method**: Divides the coordinates of this point by another point's coordinates and returns a new `Point` instance. It also checks for division by zero, throwing an error if it occurs.\n- **toString() Method**: Provides a string representation of the point for easy display.\n\nThis class can be used to perform basic arithmetic operations on points in a two-dimensional space."
