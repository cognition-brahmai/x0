        "content": "The error message you are encountering indicates that the necessary development headers for JPEG are not found, which are required by Pillow during installation. You need to ensure that you have the correct development packages installed. In Alpine Linux, the `libjpeg-turbo-dev` package provides these headers. Additionally, make sure to install other required development packages for Pillow dependencies.\n\nHere's how you can modify your Dockerfile to successfully install Pillow:\n\n```Dockerfile\nFROM python:alpine\n\n# Update and install necessary packages\nRUN apk --no-cache add \\\n    libxml2-dev \\\n    libxslt-dev \\\n    libffi-dev \\\n    gcc \\\n    musl-dev \\\n    libgcc \\\n    openssl-dev \\\n    curl \\\n    jpeg-dev \\\n    zlib-dev \\\n    tiff-dev \\\n    freetype-dev \\\n    lcms2-dev \\\n    libwebp-dev \\\n    tcl-dev \\\n    tk-dev \\\n    openjpeg-dev\n\n# Install Pillow\nRUN pip install Pillow\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Use `--no-cache add`**: This prevents the caching of the package index, which helps keep your Docker image smaller.\n2. **Install `jpeg-dev` and other `*-dev` libraries**: These are necessary for compiling Pillow with support for various image formats. They provide the required headers and static libraries needed for compilation.\n3. **Use `zlib-dev`, `tiff-dev`, `freetype-dev`, `lcms2-dev`, `libwebp-dev`, `tcl-dev`, `tk-dev`, `openjpeg-dev`**: These packages provide support for other image formats that Pillow can handle.\n\nAfter making these changes, rebuild your Docker image with the updated Dockerfile. This should resolve the issue, allowing Pillow to be installed successfully."
