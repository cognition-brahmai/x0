        "content": "To create a JavaScript regular expression that matches a 7-digit phone number where the first digit is any number from 1 to 9, and the next 6 digits do not start with 0 or 1, we can construct a regex pattern as follows:\n\n1. The first digit should be `[1-9]`.\n2. The second digit should be `[2-9]` to ensure it does not start with 0 or 1.\n3. The remaining 5 digits can be any digit `[0-9]`.\n\nThe regex pattern would look like this: `/^[1-9][2-9][0-9]{5}$/`.\n\nTo check if the phone number is valid, including the country code and area code, you need to clarify the format you expect. For instance, if you expect a format like \"+<country_code> <area_code> <7-digit_number>\", you can create a regex pattern that accommodates these parts. Here's an example pattern that matches a phone number with a country code and an area code:\n\n```javascript\nfunction isValidPhoneNumber(phoneNumber) {\n    // Assuming the format is \"+<country_code> <area_code> <7-digit_number>\"\n    // Example: \"+91 123 2345678\" - where +91 is the country code, 123 is the area code\n    const regex = /^\\+\\d{1,3} \\d{2,4} [1-9][2-9][0-9]{5}$/;\n    return regex.test(phoneNumber);\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nconsole.log(isValidPhoneNumber(\"+91 123 2345678\"));  // true\nconsole.log(isValidPhoneNumber(\"+44 20 3456789\"));   // true\nconsole.log(isValidPhoneNumber(\"+1 800 1234567\"));   // false, as it starts with 1\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- `^\\+` ensures the phone number starts with a plus sign and country code.\n- `\\d{1,3}` matches the country code with 1 to 3 digits.\n- `\\d{2,4}` matches the area code with 2 to 4 digits.\n- `[1-9][2-9][0-9]{5}` matches the 7-digit phone number as per your specifications.\n\nYou can adjust the regex based on specific requirements for the country code and area code length."
