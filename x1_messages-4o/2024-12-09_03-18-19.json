        "content": "To draw arrows using Matplotlib, you can use the `arrow` function, as you have done, or the `annotate` function, which provides more flexibility, especially for drawing arrows with two heads.\n\nHere's how you can draw a simple arrow and a two-headed arrow using Matplotlib:\n\n### Simple Arrow\n\nYou can use the `arrow` method, but `annotate` provides more control and options for styling. Here's how you can draw a simple arrow using `annotate`:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(range(10))\n\n# Simple arrow using annotate\nax.annotate('', xy=(1, 1.5), xytext=(1, 1),\n            arrowprops=dict(facecolor='black', shrink=0.05))\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Two-Headed Arrow\n\nFor a two-headed arrow, `annotate` can be used with the `head_length` and `head_width` parameters set on both ends:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(range(10))\n\n# Two-headed arrow using annotate\nax.annotate('', xy=(1, 1.5), xytext=(1, 0.5),\n            arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='<->', lw=1.5, color='red'))\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Simple Arrow**: By using `annotate`, you specify the start (`xytext`) and end (`xy`) points of the arrow. The `arrowprops` dictionary allows you to customize the arrow's appearance, such as color and style.\n  \n- **Two-Headed Arrow**: The `arrowstyle` parameter is set to `'<->'` to create arrows at both ends. You can adjust the line width (`lw`) and color as needed.\n\nThe `arrowprops` dictionary provides various customization options, giving you the flexibility to modify the arrow's appearance according to your needs."
