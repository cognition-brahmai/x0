        "content": "Sure! Here are three examples of renewable energy sources:\n\n1. **Solar Energy**: This energy is harnessed from the sun using solar panels or photovoltaic cells. It's widely used for generating electricity and heating.\n\n2. **Wind Energy**: This energy is captured using wind turbines that convert the kinetic energy from wind into mechanical power, which can then be converted into electricity.\n\n3. **Hydroelectric Energy**: This energy is produced from the movement of water, typically using dams on large rivers to generate electricity through turbines."
