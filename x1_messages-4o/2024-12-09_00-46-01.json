For instance:\n\n```python\nsum(x*x for x in range(10))\n```\n\nCould someone direct me to documentation that provides an explanation for this usage of `for`? I've found examples but no explanatory material. All the `for` loop documentation I've found so far only describes the block-code use case. I'm unsure of what to call this particular usage, hence the potential vagueness of my question."

        "content": "The usage you're referring to is known as a **generator expression** in Python. Generator expressions are a concise way to construct a new generator object. They are similar to list comprehensions but are enclosed in parentheses instead of square brackets. Generator expressions are more memory efficient than list comprehensions because they generate items one at a time and only when you iterate over them, rather than storing the entire list in memory.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of how they work:\n\n- **Syntax**: `(expression for item in iterable [if condition])`\n- **Example**: `sum(x*x for x in range(10))`\n  - This computes the sum of squares of numbers from 0 to 9.\n  \nIn the example you provided, `x*x for x in range(10)` is a generator expression that produces squares of numbers from 0 to 9. The `sum()` function then calculates the sum of these squares.\n\nFor further reading and a more comprehensive understanding, you can refer to the official Python documentation on generator expressions. Although the documentation may not always directly point you to \"generator expressions\" when searching for `for` loops, they are typically covered in sections related to comprehensions and generators.\n\nHere are some useful links to the Python documentation that may help you:\n\n- [Generator Expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#generator-expressions)\n- [Comprehensions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions)\n\nThese sections provide a detailed explanation of generator expressions and comprehensions, respectively, and should help clarify their usage and benefits."
