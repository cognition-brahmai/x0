My question is, how can I modify this code to run on two Nvidia CUDA capable cards if I have them installed on my computer? Can you please provide me with an example?"

        "content": "To modify a CUDA program to run on multiple GPUs, you'll need to manage multiple CUDA contexts, one for each GPU. This involves distributing the workload between the GPUs and ensuring that each GPU operates on its assigned portion of the data. Here\u2019s a basic outline of how you can achieve this, along with an example:\n\n1. **Initialize CUDA Devices:**\n   Detect and initialize the GPUs available in your system.\n\n2. **Partition Data:**\n   Divide the matrix data so that each GPU processes a portion of it. You can split the matrices row-wise or column-wise, depending on your implementation.\n\n3. **Create Streams:**\n   Use CUDA streams to manage concurrent execution on multiple GPUs.\n\n4. **Allocate Memory on Each GPU:**\n   Allocate memory on each GPU for the matrices and the resulting product.\n\n5. **Transfer Data to Each GPU:**\n   Transfer the respective data portion to each GPU.\n\n6. **Launch Kernels:**\n   Launch the matrix multiplication kernel on each GPU.\n\n7. **Transfer the Results Back:**\n   Transfer the results from each GPU back to the host.\n\n8. **Combine Results:**\n   Combine the results obtained from each GPU to get the final output matrix.\n\nHere\u2019s an example to get you started:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n#define N 1024  // Assuming square matrices of size N x N\n\n__global__ void matrixMulKernel(float *A, float *B, float *C, int width) {\n    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;\n    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;\n    if (row < width && col < width) {\n        float value = 0;\n        for (int k = 0; k < width; ++k) {\n            value += A[row * width + k] * B[k * width + col];\n        }\n        C[row * width + col] = value;\n    }\n}\n\nvoid matrixMultiply(float *A, float *B, float *C, int width) {\n    int nDevices;\n    cudaGetDeviceCount(&nDevices);\n\n    if (nDevices < 2) {\n        printf(\"This program requires at least two GPUs.\\n\");\n        return;\n    }\n\n    size_t size = width * width * sizeof(float);\n    float *d_A[2], *d_B[2], *d_C[2];\n\n    // Split the task between two devices\n    for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {\n        cudaSetDevice(i);\n\n        // Allocate device memory for each device\n        cudaMalloc((void**)&d_A[i], size / 2);\n        cudaMalloc((void**)&d_B[i], size);\n        cudaMalloc((void**)&d_C[i], size / 2);\n\n        // Copy data to device\n        cudaMemcpy(d_A[i], A + i * width * (width/2), size / 2, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);\n        cudaMemcpy(d_B[i], B, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);\n    }\n\n    dim3 dimBlock(16, 16);\n    dim3 dimGrid((width + dimBlock.x - 1) / dimBlock.x, (width/2 + dimBlock.y - 1) / dimBlock.y);\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {\n        cudaSetDevice(i);\n        matrixMulKernel<<<dimGrid, dimBlock>>>(d_A[i], d_B[i], d_C[i], width);\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {\n        cudaSetDevice(i);\n        cudaMemcpy(C + i * width * (width/2), d_C[i], size / 2, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);\n    }\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {\n        cudaSetDevice(i);\n        cudaFree(d_A[i]);\n        cudaFree(d_B[i]);\n        cudaFree(d_C[i]);\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    float A[N * N], B[N * N], C[N * N];\n\n    // Initialize matrices A and B with some values\n    for (int i = 0; i < N * N; ++i) {\n        A[i] = 1.0f;\n        B[i] = 1.0f;\n    }\n\n    matrixMultiply(A, B, C, N);\n\n    // Check result\n    bool success = true;\n    for (int i = 0; i < N * N; ++i) {\n        if (C[i] != N) {\n            success = false;\n            break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    if (success) {\n        printf(\"Matrix multiplication successful!\\n\");\n    } else {\n        printf(\"Matrix multiplication failed!\\n\");\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The code initializes two CUDA devices assuming you have at least two GPUs.\n- It splits the matrices `A` and `C` row-wise for processing on two devices.\n- Each GPU performs matrix multiplication on its part of the data.\n- The results are combined in the host memory to form the final matrix.\n\nThis is a basic example and may need adjustments depending on specific requirements and hardware configurations. Make sure to check for any CUDA errors in a real-world application."
