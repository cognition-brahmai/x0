        "content": "Yes, Python provides a way to send and receive UDP multicast packets using the `socket` library, which is part of the standard library. Below is a simple example of how you can implement both sending and receiving of UDP multicast messages in Python. \n\n### Sending UDP Multicast\n\nTo send a UDP multicast message, you need to create a socket and set the necessary socket options for multicast.\n\n```python\nimport socket\nimport struct\n\ndef send_multicast_message(message, multicast_group, port):\n    # Create the datagram socket\n    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM, socket.IPPROTO_UDP)\n\n    # Set a time-to-live on the message. This can be necessary to allow the message to be sent beyond the host.\n    ttl = struct.pack('b', 1)\n    sock.setsockopt(socket.IPPROTO_IP, socket.IP_MULTICAST_TTL, ttl)\n\n    try:\n        # Send the message to the multicast group\n        print(f'Sending \"{message}\" to {multicast_group}:{port}')\n        sent = sock.sendto(message.encode(), (multicast_group, port))\n\n    finally:\n        print('Closing socket')\n        sock.close()\n\n# Usage\nmulticast_group = '224.1.1.1'\nport = 5007\nsend_multicast_message('Hello, Multicast!', multicast_group, port)\n```\n\n### Receiving UDP Multicast\n\nTo receive UDP multicast messages, you need to join a multicast group.\n\n```python\nimport socket\nimport struct\n\ndef receive_multicast_message(multicast_group, port):\n    # Create the socket\n    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM, socket.IPPROTO_UDP)\n\n    # Allow multiple sockets to use the same PORT number\n    sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)\n\n    # Bind the socket to the server address\n    sock.bind(('', port))\n\n    # Tell the operating system to add the socket to the multicast group\n    # on all interfaces.\n    group = socket.inet_aton(multicast_group)\n    mreq = struct.pack('4sL', group, socket.INADDR_ANY)\n    sock.setsockopt(socket.IPPROTO_IP, socket.IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP, mreq)\n\n    try:\n        print(f'Waiting to receive message on {multicast_group}:{port}')\n        while True:\n            data, address = sock.recvfrom(1024)\n            print(f'Received \"{data.decode()}\" from {address}')\n\n    finally:\n        sock.close()\n\n# Usage\nmulticast_group = '224.1.1.1'\nport = 5007\nreceive_multicast_message(multicast_group, port)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Multicast Group**: The IP address `224.1.1.1` is used in this example. Multicast addresses range from `224.0.0.0` to `239.255.255.255`.\n- **Port Number**: Both sending and receiving should use the same port number.\n- **TTL (Time-to-Live)**: This is set to 1 to ensure the packet is limited to the local network segment.\n\nYou can run the sending and receiving scripts separately. Make sure your network supports multicast if you are trying this in a real environment."
