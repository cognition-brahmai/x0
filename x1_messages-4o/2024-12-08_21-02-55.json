        "content": "Certainly! Below is an example of an Excel table with scenarios for \"Disaster\" and \"Bliss\" involving animals, along with the Excel code used to create the table.\n\n### Excel Table\n\n| Scenario ID | Context  | Word     | Description                                                                 | Location         | Time           | People Involved              | Additional Information                                         |\n|-------------|----------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1           | Wildlife | Disaster | A wildfire in a national park endangers the habitat of various species.     | Yellowstone Park | August 2022    | Park Rangers, Firefighters   | Emergency response teams worked tirelessly to control the fire.|\n| 2           | Pet Care | Bliss    | A therapy dog helps children with autism improve their social skills.       | New York City    | Ongoing        | Therapists, Families         | The therapy sessions are held weekly with excellent progress.  |\n\n### Excel Code\n\nIf you want to generate this table in Excel using VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) code, you can use the following code snippet:\n\n```vba\nSub CreateAnimalScenariosTable()\n\n    Dim ws As Worksheet\n    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets.Add\n    ws.Name = \"Animal Scenarios\"\n\n    ' Define the headers\n    ws.Range(\"A1\").Value = \"Scenario ID\"\n    ws.Range(\"B1\").Value = \"Context\"\n    ws.Range(\"C1\").Value = \"Word\"\n    ws.Range(\"D1\").Value = \"Description\"\n    ws.Range(\"E1\").Value = \"Location\"\n    ws.Range(\"F1\").Value = \"Time\"\n    ws.Range(\"G1\").Value = \"People Involved\"\n    ws.Range(\"H1\").Value = \"Additional Information\"\n\n    ' Fill the table with data\n    ws.Range(\"A2\").Value = 1\n    ws.Range(\"B2\").Value = \"Wildlife\"\n    ws.Range(\"C2\").Value = \"Disaster\"\n    ws.Range(\"D2\").Value = \"A wildfire in a national park endangers the habitat of various species.\"\n    ws.Range(\"E2\").Value = \"Yellowstone Park\"\n    ws.Range(\"F2\").Value = \"August 2022\"\n    ws.Range(\"G2\").Value = \"Park Rangers, Firefighters\"\n    ws.Range(\"H2\").Value = \"Emergency response teams worked tirelessly to control the fire.\"\n\n    ws.Range(\"A3\").Value = 2\n    ws.Range(\"B3\").Value = \"Pet Care\"\n    ws.Range(\"C3\").Value = \"Bliss\"\n    ws.Range(\"D3\").Value = \"A therapy dog helps children with autism improve their social skills.\"\n    ws.Range(\"E3\").Value = \"New York City\"\n    ws.Range(\"F3\").Value = \"Ongoing\"\n    ws.Range(\"G3\").Value = \"Therapists, Families\"\n    ws.Range(\"H3\").Value = \"The therapy sessions are held weekly with excellent progress.\"\n\n    ' Format the header\n    With ws.Range(\"A1:H1\")\n        .Font.Bold = True\n        .Interior.Color = RGB(200, 200, 200)\n    End With\n\n    ' Auto-fit columns\n    ws.Columns(\"A:H\").AutoFit\n\nEnd Sub\n```\n\nTo use the VBA code:\n\n1. Open Excel and press `ALT` + `F11` to open the VBA editor.\n2. Click `Insert` > `Module` and paste the code into the module window.\n3. Run the macro by pressing `F5` or navigating to `Run` > `Run Sub/UserForm`.\n\nThis will create a new worksheet named \"Animal Scenarios\" with the desired table."
