Here is the code:\n\n```python\nvec = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]\nprint [num for elem in vec for num in elem]\n```\n\nThe output is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`. \n\nI understand that `elem` represents the lists inside the list from `for elem in vec`. However, I don't quite understand the usage of `num` and `for num in elem` in the beginning and the end. Can someone explain how Python interprets this list comprehension and what's the order it looks at?"

        "content": "Certainly! List comprehensions in Python provide a concise way to create lists. When you see a list comprehension with multiple `for` clauses, it can resemble nested loops. Let's break down the given example:\n\n```python\nvec = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]\nprint([num for elem in vec for num in elem])\n```\n\nThis list comprehension is equivalent to writing the following nested `for` loops:\n\n```python\nresult = []\nfor elem in vec:\n    for num in elem:\n        result.append(num)\n```\n\nHere's how Python interprets it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Outer Loop (`for elem in vec`)**: This iterates over each sub-list in the `vec` list. So, `elem` will take the values `[1, 2, 3]`, then `[4, 5, 6]`, and finally `[7, 8, 9]` in successive iterations.\n\n2. **Inner Loop (`for num in elem`)**: For each iteration of the outer loop, this inner loop iterates over each element in the current `elem`. So, when `elem` is `[1, 2, 3]`, `num` will take the values `1`, `2`, and `3` in successive iterations. This pattern repeats for each `elem`.\n\n3. **Expression (`num`)**: This specifies what is appended to the resulting list. Here, `num` is directly appended, so each number from the inner lists is added to the final list.\n\nThe output `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` is a flattened version of `vec`, meaning all elements of the sub-lists are extracted and combined into a single list. The list comprehension effectively flattens the 2D list (`vec`) into a 1D list by iterating through each element in each sub-list."
