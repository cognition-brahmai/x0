However, if you\u2019re sure you want to remove it, here\u2019s what you can do:\n\n1. **Remove Specific Release**: You can remove a specific version of your package through the PyPI web interface. Log in to your PyPI account, navigate to your project, and remove the specific release from the \"Releases\" section.\n\n2. **Contact PyPI Support**: If you want to completely delete the entire project, you might need to contact the PyPI support team. Use the PyPI contact form to explain your request. They will evaluate your request based on their policies.\n\n3. **Deprecate Instead**: Sometimes, it\u2019s better to deprecate a package instead of removing it. You can upload a new version with a warning that the package is obsolete and guide users to alternatives.\n\n4. **Set \u201cYanked\u201d**: You can yank a release, which makes it so that it won't be installable using `pip` without specifying the version. This can be done by adding a `yanked` metadata tag when you upload a new release.\n\nRemember to always communicate with your users if you\u2019re making significant changes to a package they might depend on."
