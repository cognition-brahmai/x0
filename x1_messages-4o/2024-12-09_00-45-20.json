For the `x`-direction, I use input `stride=1`, `distance=nx` and `batch=ny * nz`, which works fine. However, I am having difficulty figuring out how to compute the FFTs in the `y`-direction. A batch for each `xy` plane seems straightforward with input `stride=nx`, `dist=1`, and `batch=nx`, but when I use `batch=nx * nz`, the distance is larger than `1` as we move from `{3,7,11,15}` to `{16,20,24,28}`. How can I achieve the FFTs in the `y`-direction using cufftPlanMany?"

        "content": "To achieve 1D FFTs in the `y`-direction with `cufftPlanMany`, you need to carefully set your stride, batch, and distance parameters to properly account for the layout of your 3D data in a 1D array.\n\nHere's how you can approach this:\n\n1. **Understand the Layout**: Your data is laid out in a 1D array but conceptually represents a 3D grid. For a grid of size `nx * ny * nz`, your data is organized such that moving from one `x` value to the next is a stride of 1, moving to the next `y` value involves skipping `nx` elements, and moving to the next `z` value involves skipping `nx * ny` elements.\n\n2. **Plan for `y`-direction FFTs**:\n   - **Stride**: This should be `nx`, as moving between elements in the `y` direction means skipping over `nx` elements (the entire `x`-row).\n   - **Batch**: This should be `nx * nz`, as you want to perform the FFT in the `y` direction for each `x` column across all `z` planes.\n   - **Distance**: Set this to `ny`, as this represents the number of elements to skip to get from one `y`-column to the next in the same `z` plane.\n\n3. **Setup `cufftPlanMany`**:\n   - Create a plan with dimensions specified for the FFT in the `y`-direction. \n   - Use the calculated `stride`, `batch`, and `distance` values in setting up your `cufftPlanMany`.\n\nHere's some pseudocode to illustrate:\n\n```c\nint rank = 1;  // 1D FFTs\nint n[] = { ny };  // size of FFT in y-direction\nint istride = nx;  // elements to skip over in input to move in y-direction\nint ostride = nx;  // elements to skip over in output to move in y-direction\nint idist = 1;  // distance between consecutive batches in input\nint odist = 1;  // distance between consecutive batches in output\nint inembed[] = { ny, nx };  // input layout\nint onembed[] = { ny, nx };  // output layout\nint batch = nx * nz;  // number of FFTs to compute\n\ncufftHandle plan;\ncufftPlanMany(&plan, rank, n,\n              inembed, istride, idist,\n              onembed, ostride, odist,\n              CUFFT_R2C, batch);\n\n// Execute the plan\ncufftExecR2C(plan, input_data, output_data);\n```\n\nIn this setup, `inembed` and `onembed` are used to specify the physical layout of the data, and you manage the data strides and distances as needed for your specific transformation.\n\nIf you run into any issues, double-check your data layout assumptions and ensure that the `stride`, `batch`, and `distance` values are consistent with how your data is structured in memory."
