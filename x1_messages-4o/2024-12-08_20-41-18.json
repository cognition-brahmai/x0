        "content": "To represent the path of a single photon of light traveling from the Sun to Earth in LaTeX, we can illustrate it as a straight line since light travels in a straight path in a vacuum. Here's a simple representation:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{standalone}\n\\usepackage{tikz}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\begin{tikzpicture}\n    % Sun\n    \\filldraw[orange] (0,0) circle (1cm) node[anchor=east] {Sun};\n\n    % Earth\n    \\filldraw[blue] (10,0) circle (0.5cm) node[anchor=west] {Earth};\n\n    % Path of the photon\n    \\draw[->, thick] (1,0) -- (9.5,0) node[midway, above] {Photon path};\n\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nTo calculate the time it takes for a photon to travel from the Sun to Earth, we can use the following formula:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{d}{c}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( t \\) is the time taken,\n- \\( d \\) is the distance from the Sun to Earth,\n- \\( c \\) is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\nThe average distance from the Sun to Earth is approximately \\( 149.6 \\times 10^6 \\) kilometers, and the speed of light \\( c \\) is \\( 299,792 \\) kilometers per second. Plugging these values into the formula gives:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{149.6 \\times 10^6 \\text{ km}}{299,792 \\text{ km/s}}\n\\]\n\nCalculating this gives:\n\n\\[\nt \\approx 499 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nThus, it takes approximately 499 seconds or about 8 minutes and 19 seconds for a photon to travel from the Sun to Earth."
