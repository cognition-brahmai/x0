Using a for-loop on each value of the dataframe was taking too much time. I tried using data_new=data.subtract(data) to subtract all the values of the dataframe from itself so that I can make all the non-null values 0, but it returned an error because the dataframe contains multiple string entries."

        "content": "To efficiently replace all non-NaN entries with 1 and all NaN values with 0 in a large DataFrame, you can leverage the power of Pandas' vectorized operations. Instead of using a for-loop, which is indeed slow for large DataFrames, you can use the `applymap` function or a combination of `fillna` and boolean indexing in Pandas. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Assuming 'data' is your DataFrame\ndata_new = data.notna().astype(int)\n```\n\nHere's a brief explanation of the steps:\n\n1. `data.notna()`: This creates a boolean DataFrame where all non-NaN entries are `True` and all NaN values are `False`.\n\n2. `.astype(int)`: This converts the boolean DataFrame into an integer DataFrame, where `True` becomes `1` and `False` becomes `0`.\n\nThis approach is efficient and takes full advantage of Pandas' vectorized operations, making it suitable for large DataFrames like yours with 71 columns and 30,597 rows."
