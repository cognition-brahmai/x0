After making some modifications to the dataset, I performed logistic regression and LDA, both of which worked fine. However, when I try to apply QDA using the code `qda.model <- qda(Survived~. , data = df.train)`, I encounter an error that says `Error in qda.default(x, grouping, ...) : groupe 0 n'est pas de rang plein`. From my understanding, this suggests that I have a rank deficiency. I have checked the data which includes 8 predictors and 891 observations, and it appears that no predictor is a linear combination of others. Can someone help me understand what's causing the issue with the QDA?"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering is indeed related to a rank deficiency, which can occur in Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) when the covariance matrix of one or more groups is not full rank. This issue typically arises when there is multicollinearity among the predictors or when there are not enough observations per group relative to the number of predictors.\n\nHere are some steps to diagnose and potentially resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check for Near Multicollinearity:**\n   - Even if no predictor is a perfect linear combination of others, near multicollinearity can still cause issues. You can use the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to detect multicollinearity. A VIF value greater than 5-10 suggests multicollinearity.\n\n2. **Inspect Group Sizes:**\n   - Ensure that each class of the target variable (`Survived` in this case) has enough observations. If one class has significantly fewer observations than the number of predictors, QDA might fail.\n\n3. **Reduce Dimensionality:**\n   - Consider using dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) before applying QDA. This can help reduce multicollinearity and improve the stability of the covariance matrices.\n\n4. **Regularization:**\n   - While QDA doesn't inherently support regularization, you might explore using Regularized Discriminant Analysis (RDA) or similar methods that can accommodate rank-deficient covariance matrices.\n\n5. **Data Preprocessing:**\n   - Ensure that all predictors are on a similar scale. Although QDA is not as sensitive to scaling as some other methods, standardizing or normalizing the predictors can sometimes help.\n\n6. **Check for Perfect Separation:**\n   - If any predictor perfectly separates the classes, this can lead to issues. Ensure that there is no perfect separation in your data.\n\n7. **Inspect for Missing Values:**\n   - Double-check that there are no missing values in the predictors, as these can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior in statistical models.\n\n8. **Simplify the Model:**\n   - As a last resort, try removing some predictors to see if the model can be simplified enough to avoid rank deficiency.\n\nBy addressing these areas, you should be able to identify the source of the rank deficiency and apply QDA more effectively to your dataset."
