The error message I receive is \"BC30560: 'ExtensionAttribute' is ambiguous in the namespace 'System.Runtime.CompilerServices'.\" According to the issue tracker, this problem is known but it was hoped that the workaround provided would not be necessary in the subsequent release. However, I am using the latest release, which is newer than the one mentioned in the report. I even tried replacing the file from the current release with the one provided in the issue tracker, but this did not solve the problem. Is there another solution to this issue apart from downloading the source and building it manually?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"BC30560: 'ExtensionAttribute' is ambiguous in the namespace 'System.Runtime.CompilerServices',\" typically arises due to multiple definitions of the `ExtensionAttribute` class being present in your project. This can happen if different assemblies have their own versions of this attribute.\n\nHere are a few steps you can try to resolve this issue without having to manually build the source:\n\n1. **Check References:** Ensure you're not referencing multiple assemblies that define `ExtensionAttribute`. This attribute is commonly found in different versions of the .NET framework assemblies, so make sure you have consistent versions of all your assemblies.\n\n2. **Remove Duplicate Assemblies:** Look through your project's references and remove any duplicates or conflicting assemblies that might define `ExtensionAttribute`. Check both your web.config and any other configuration files that might be referencing assemblies.\n\n3. **Use Compiler Aliases:** If you cannot remove a reference due to dependencies, you can use compiler aliases to disambiguate them. You can alias one of the assemblies in your project file and reference it by alias.\n\n4. **Check for Conflicting NuGet Packages:** Sometimes, NuGet packages might bring in conflicting assemblies. Check your `packages.config` or `ProjectName.csproj` file for any packages that might be causing the issue and consider updating or removing them.\n\n5. **Web.Config Modifications:** In some cases, modifications to the `web.config` file can resolve assembly binding issues. Ensure that your `web.config` has the correct assembly binding redirects.\n\n6. **Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes, a clean and rebuild of the solution can resolve issues caused by old binaries being cached.\n\n7. **Upgrade Framework:** If possible, try upgrading your project to a newer version of the .NET Framework that might handle these ambiguities better.\n\nIf none of these steps work, you may indeed need to consider building from the source, but this should typically be a last resort. Also, keep an eye on any updates or patches from the maintainers of the libraries in question, as they might address this issue in future releases."
