However, when I try to name the columns using `columns = ['one', 'two', 'three']`, I get an error. How can I successfully name the columns in my dataframe?"

        "content": "To successfully name the columns in your DataFrame after converting the dictionary with row orientation, you'll need to assign the column names directly to the DataFrame after it has been created. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Your dictionary\nmy_dict = {'key1': [1, 2, 3], 'key2': [4, 5, 6], 'key3': [7, 8, 9]}\n\n# Convert dictionary to DataFrame with row orientation\ndf = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(my_dict, orient='index')\n\n# Assign column names\ndf.columns = ['one', 'two', 'three']\n\n# Display the DataFrame\nprint(df)\n```\n\nThis should give you a DataFrame where the columns are correctly named 'one', 'two', and 'three'. The `orient='index'` parameter ensures that the keys of the dictionary become the indices of the DataFrame, and by setting `df.columns`, you are directly assigning the desired column names to the DataFrame."
