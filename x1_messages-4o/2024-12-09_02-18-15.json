How can I use the query syntax to filter the DataFrame to only include rows where the 'value' column is 'NaN'? When I try to use the syntax 'df.query( '(value < 10) or (value == NaN)' )', I receive an error stating 'name NaN is not defined'. This also occurs when I use 'df.query('value ==NaN')'. Is there a way to use numpy names such as 'inf', 'nan', 'pi', 'e', etc. in queries?"

        "content": "When using the `query` method in Pandas, you need to be aware that it operates in a string context, which means that certain Python objects or functions (like `np.nan`) aren't directly recognized. Since `NaN` is a special floating-point value, you can't compare it directly using the `==` operator within a `query` string. Instead, you should use the `isnull()` method for this kind of filtering.\n\nHere is how you can filter your DataFrame to include only rows where the 'value' column is `NaN`:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {'value': [1.5, 2.3, np.nan, 4.1, np.nan]}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Filtering rows where 'value' is NaN\nfiltered_df = df[df['value'].isnull()]\n\nprint(filtered_df)\n```\n\nIn this example, `df['value'].isnull()` returns a boolean Series that is `True` wherever the value is `NaN`, and `False` otherwise. The DataFrame is then indexed with this boolean Series to filter out only the rows where `value` is `NaN`.\n\nIf you specifically want to use the `query` method, you could use it in combination with the `isnull()` function by defining it outside the query string:\n\n```python\nfiltered_df = df.query('value != value')\n```\n\nAlthough Pandas `query` is not directly designed to handle `isnull()` inside the query string, a workaround like `value != value` is a valid trick because `NaN` is not equal to itself in floating-point arithmetic. However, it's more idiomatic to use `isnull()` or `isna()` directly for such operations."
