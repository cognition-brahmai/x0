        "content": "To write a function that takes a list of dictionaries as input and returns a tuple containing the name and age of each member, you can follow these steps in Python:\n\n1. Define the function with an appropriate name.\n2. Iterate over the list of dictionaries.\n3. For each dictionary, extract the values for the keys `\"name\"` and `\"age\"`.\n4. Collect these values into a tuple and append them to a result list.\n5. Return the list of tuples.\n\nHere is a sample implementation:\n\n```python\ndef extract_name_and_age(members):\n    result = []\n    for member in members:\n        # Assuming each dictionary has a 'name' and 'age' key\n        name = member.get('name')\n        age = member.get('age')\n        result.append((name, age))\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nmembers_list = [\n    {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'},\n    {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25, 'city': 'Los Angeles'},\n    {'name': 'Charlie', 'age': 35, 'city': 'Chicago'}\n]\n\nname_age_tuples = extract_name_and_age(members_list)\nprint(name_age_tuples)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n[('Alice', 30), ('Bob', 25), ('Charlie', 35)]\n```\n\nThis function assumes that each dictionary in the list contains the keys `\"name\"` and `\"age\"`. If there's a possibility that these keys might not be present in some dictionaries, you might want to add error handling or default values."
