I want to add version information to my executables but I'm having trouble understanding what a version file should look like. The PyInstaller manual suggests using the --version-file=FILE command to add a version resource from the file to the executable, but I don't know what this file should contain. I've also tried using the GrabVersion.py utility to steal a version resource from an existing executable, but I keep encountering errors. Can anyone provide an example of a version file or help me understand why I'm encountering these errors?\n\nErrors I've encountered:\n\nFor executables with no version information:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"C:\\pyinstaller-2.0\\utils\\GrabVersion.py\", line 42, in \n    vs  = versioninfo.decode(sys.argv[1])\n  File \"C:\\pyinstaller-2.0\\PyInstaller\\utils\\versioninfo.py\", line 33, in decode\n    nm = win32api.EnumResourceNames(h, RT_VERSION)[0]\nIndexError: list index out of range\n```\n\nFor the rest of the executables:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"C:\\pyinstaller-2.0\\utils\\GrabVersion.py\", line 43, in \n    print vs\n  File \"C:\\pyinstaller-2.0\\PyInstaller\\utils\\versioninfo.py\", line 147, in __repr__\n    % (indent, self.ffi.__repr__(indent), indent,\n  File \"C:\\pyinstaller-2.0\\PyInstaller\\utils\\versioninfo.py\", line 251, in __repr__\n    \"filevers=%s,\" % fv,\nTypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting\n```"

        "content": "To add version information to your executables in PyInstaller, you need to create a version file in a specific format that PyInstaller can understand. This file is often referred to as a \"version info file\" or \"version resource file.\" It contains metadata about the executable, such as the product name, version number, company name, etc. Here's a basic example of what the content of a version file might look like:\n\n```text\nVSVersionInfo(\n  ffi=FixedFileInfo(\n    filevers=(1, 0, 0, 0),\n    prodvers=(1, 0, 0, 0),\n    mask=0x3f,\n    flags=0x0,\n    OS=0x40004,\n    fileType=0x1,\n    subtype=0x0,\n    date=(0, 0)\n    ),\n  kids=[\n    StringFileInfo(\n      [\n      StringTable(\n        u'040904B0',\n        [StringStruct(u'CompanyName', u'Your Company Name'),\n        StringStruct(u'FileDescription', u'Your File Description'),\n        StringStruct(u'FileVersion', u'1.0.0.0'),\n        StringStruct(u'InternalName', u'YourInternalName'),\n        StringStruct(u'LegalCopyright', u'(C) 2023 Your Company Name. All rights reserved.'),\n        StringStruct(u'OriginalFilename', u'YourOriginalFilename.exe'),\n        StringStruct(u'ProductName', u'Your Product Name'),\n        StringStruct(u'ProductVersion', u'1.0.0.0')])\n      ]),\n    VarFileInfo([VarStruct(u'Translation', [1033, 1200])])\n  ]\n)\n```\n\n### Steps to Create and Use the Version File:\n\n1. **Create a Version File:**\n   - Save the above content in a text file, e.g., `version_info.txt`.\n\n2. **Use the Version File with PyInstaller:**\n   - When building your executable with PyInstaller, use the `--version-file` option to specify this file. For example:\n     ```bash\n     pyinstaller --onefile --version-file=version_info.txt your_script.py\n     ```\n\n### Troubleshooting the Errors:\n\n1. **Executables with No Version Information:**\n   - The error `IndexError: list index out of range` occurs because the `GrabVersion.py` script is trying to access version information that doesn't exist in the executable. Ensure the executable you are examining has version information embedded.\n\n2. **String Formatting Error:**\n   - The `TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting` suggests there might be an issue with the string formatting in the script. This could be due to improper handling of the resource data or an error in the script itself. Double-check the compatibility of the `GrabVersion.py` utility with your version of PyInstaller, as it may require some adjustments or updates.\n\nIf you're still encountering issues, consider manually crafting the version info file as shown and using it directly with PyInstaller. This avoids the dependency on `GrabVersion.py` and potential errors arising from it."
