Here's how you can structure the SQL query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    f.title, \n    SUM(fa.number_of_awards) AS total_awards\nFROM \n    films f\nJOIN \n    festival_awards fa ON f.film_id = fa.film_id\nGROUP BY \n    f.title\nORDER BY \n    total_awards DESC;\n```\n\nIn this query:\n\n- We are selecting the film title and the sum of the number of awards from the `festival_awards` table.\n- We join the `films` table with the `festival_awards` table on the `film_id`.\n- We group the results by film title to aggregate the total number of awards for each film.\n- Finally, we sort the results in descending order based on the total number of awards. \n\nThis will give you a list of films along with the total number of awards they have won, sorted from most to least awards."
