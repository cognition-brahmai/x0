The routine is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef iterative_dfs(graph, start, path=[]):\n    q = [start]\n    while q:\n        v = q.pop(0)\n        if v not in path:\n            path = path + [v]\n            q = graph[v] + q\n    return path\n\ngraph = {\n    'a': ['b', 'c'],\n    'b': ['d'],\n    'c': ['d'],\n    'd': ['e'],\n    'e': []\n}\nprint(iterative_dfs(graph, 'a'))\n```\n\nI would like to modify this routine into a minimal version of a topological sort method. I have seen a clever idea in this video and I'm wondering if the same trick can be applied to my code. The goal is not to optimize the `iterative_dfs`, but to learn more about graph theory algorithms by creating a minimal `topological_sort` derived from it. I am not looking for a completely different version of topological sort, but the smallest possible set of tweaks to my existing code."

        "content": "To modify your existing `iterative_dfs` routine into a minimal version of a topological sort, you'll need to make a few small adjustments. The goal of topological sorting is to order the vertices of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge \\( uv \\), vertex \\( u \\) comes before \\( v \\).\n\nHere's a minimal set of tweaks to your code to achieve a topological sort:\n\n1. Use a stack to keep track of the current path and store the vertices in the topological order.\n2. Instead of adding nodes to the path immediately, defer it until all descendants are processed.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\ndef topological_sort(graph):\n    visited = set()\n    stack = []\n    \n    def dfs(v):\n        if v in visited:\n            return\n        visited.add(v)\n        for neighbor in graph[v]:\n            dfs(neighbor)\n        stack.append(v)\n\n    for node in graph:\n        if node not in visited:\n            dfs(node)\n    \n    return stack[::-1]  # Reverse the stack to get the topological order\n\ngraph = {\n    'a': ['b', 'c'],\n    'b': ['d'],\n    'c': ['d'],\n    'd': ['e'],\n    'e': []\n}\nprint(topological_sort(graph))\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **Visited Set:** Use a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing them more than once.\n- **DFS Function:** A helper function `dfs` is used to perform the depth-first search recursively, marking nodes as visited and adding them to the stack after processing all their descendants.\n- **Stack:** Once a node has processed all its descendants, it's added to the stack. This ensures that nodes are added in the reverse order of their dependency resolution.\n- **Reverse the Stack:** Finally, reverse the stack to get the correct topological order.\n\nThis approach retains the core idea of your `iterative_dfs` method while adapting it for topological sorting."
