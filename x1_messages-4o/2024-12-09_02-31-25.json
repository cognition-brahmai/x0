        "content": "The error message \"Attempting to use uninitialized value Variable\" typically occurs in TensorFlow when you try to use a variable before it has been initialized. In TensorFlow, variables need to be explicitly initialized before they can be used in computations. This is usually done with a specific operation that initializes all variables in the graph.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to fix this error in your code:\n\n1. **Add Variable Initialization**: Before running your TensorFlow session, you must ensure that all variables are initialized. This is usually done with `tf.global_variables_initializer()`.\n\n2. **Simplified Example**: Here is a simplified version of how you can implement multivariate linear regression using TensorFlow:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ndef hypothesis_function(input_2d_matrix_trainingexamples,\n                        output_matrix_of_trainingexamples,\n                        initial_parameters_of_hypothesis_function,\n                        learning_rate, num_steps):\n    # Convert input data to numpy arrays\n    X = np.array(input_2d_matrix_trainingexamples, dtype=np.float32)\n    y = np.array(output_matrix_of_trainingexamples, dtype=np.float32).reshape(-1, 1)\n    \n    # Number of features\n    num_features = X.shape[1]\n    \n    # Define placeholders for inputs and outputs\n    X_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, num_features], name=\"X\")\n    y_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 1], name=\"y\")\n    \n    # Define variables for weights\n    W = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([num_features, 1]), name=\"weights\")\n    \n    # Define the linear model\n    predictions = tf.matmul(X_placeholder, W)\n    \n    # Define the loss function (mean squared error)\n    loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(predictions - y_placeholder))\n    \n    # Define the optimizer (Gradient Descent)\n    optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(learning_rate=learning_rate)\n    train_op = optimizer.minimize(loss)\n    \n    # Initialize all variables\n    init = tf.global_variables_initializer()\n    \n    # Start a session\n    with tf.Session() as sess:\n        # Run the variable initializer\n        sess.run(init)\n        \n        # Train the model\n        for step in range(num_steps):\n            _, current_loss, current_weights = sess.run(\n                [train_op, loss, W],\n                feed_dict={X_placeholder: X, y_placeholder: y}\n            )\n            if step % 20 == 0:\n                print(f\"Step {step}, Loss: {current_loss}, Weights: {current_weights.ravel()}\")\n        \n        # Output the final weights\n        final_weights = sess.run(W)\n        print(f\"Final Weights: {final_weights.ravel()}\")\n\narray = [[0.0, 1.0, 2.0], [0.0, 2.0, 3.0], [0.0, 4.0, 5.0]]\nhypothesis_function(array, [8.0, 13.0, 23.0], [1.0, 1.0, 1.0], 0.01, 200)\n```\n\n3. **Explanation**:\n   - **Placeholders**: Used to feed input data into the TensorFlow graph.\n   - **Variables**: Represent the weights of the model that are updated during training.\n   - **Initialization**: `tf.global_variables_initializer()` is called to initialize all variables.\n   - **Session**: A TensorFlow session is used to run the operations defined in the graph.\n\nMake sure you have TensorFlow installed and use a version compatible with your code. TensorFlow 1.x code may need updating if you are using TensorFlow 2.x, which uses eager execution by default."
