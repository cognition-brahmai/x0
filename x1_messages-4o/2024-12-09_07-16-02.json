        "content": "I am trying to create a function named `anti_vowel` that will remove all vowels (aeiouAEIOU) from a string. The function is supposed to convert the input string into a list, loop through it, and remove all vowel characters. However, when I run the function with the sample text \"Hey look Words!\", it returns \"Hy lk Words!\". It seems to \"forget\" to remove the last 'o' in the string. Here is the code I am currently using: \n\n```python\ntext = \"Hey look Words!\"\n\ndef anti_vowel(text):\n\n    textlist = list(text)\n\n    for char in textlist:\n        if char.lower() in 'aeiou':\n            textlist.remove(char)\n\n    return \"\".join(textlist)\n\nprint anti_vowel(text)\n```\n\nCan you help me understand why this is happening and how I can resolve this?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to modifying a list while iterating over it. When you remove an element from the list, the indices of subsequent elements are shifted, which can cause you to skip elements.\n\nHere's a corrected version of your function:\n\n```python\ndef anti_vowel(text):\n    textlist = list(text)\n    result = []\n\n    for char in textlist:\n        if char.lower() not in 'aeiou':\n            result.append(char)\n\n    return \"\".join(result)\n\ntext = \"Hey look Words!\"\nprint(anti_vowel(text))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Separate Result Storage**: Instead of modifying the list you're iterating over, use a separate list `result` to store non-vowel characters.\n\n2. **Appending Non-Vowels**: During the iteration, check if the character is not a vowel. If it's not, append it to the `result` list.\n\n3. **Joining Result**: Finally, join the `result` list into a string and return it.\n\nThis approach avoids modifying the list while iterating, ensuring that no characters are skipped, and your function will work correctly for the input \"Hey look Words!\" as well as other strings."
