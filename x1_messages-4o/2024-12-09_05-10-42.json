If it does exist, it will update the existing one, and if it doesn't, it will create a new answer. Currently, on the frontend, I use the POST method to create an answer sent to `api/answers`, and PUT method to update sent to e.g. `api/answers/24`. I am unsure where to implement this functionality. Should I override `create()` in the serializer or in the ViewSet or somewhere else?\n\nHere are my model, serializer, and view:\n\n```python\nclass Answer(models.Model):\n    question = models.OneToOneField(\n        Question, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name=\"answer\"\n    )\n    answer = models.CharField(\n        max_length=1, choices=ANSWER_CHOICES, null=True, blank=True\n    )\n\nclass AnswerSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):\n    question = serializers.PrimaryKeyRelatedField(\n        many=False, queryset=Question.objects.all()\n    )\n\n    class Meta:\n        model = Answer\n        fields = (\"id\", \"answer\", \"question\")\n\nclass AnswerViewSet(ModelViewSet):\n    queryset = Answer.objects.all()\n    serializer_class = AnswerSerializer\n    filter_fields = (\"question\", \"answer\")\n```"

        "content": "To implement the functionality where a POST request to `api/answers` either creates or updates an answer based on whether it exists, you can override the `create` method in the `AnswerViewSet`. This approach allows you to handle the logic at the view level, which is appropriate for handling such request-specific logic.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. Override the `create` method in your `AnswerViewSet`.\n2. In the overridden method, check if an `Answer` object already exists for the given `question_id`.\n3. If it exists, update the existing object.\n4. If it doesn't exist, create a new `Answer` object.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom rest_framework.response import Response\nfrom rest_framework import status\nfrom rest_framework.decorators import action\n\nclass AnswerViewSet(ModelViewSet):\n    queryset = Answer.objects.all()\n    serializer_class = AnswerSerializer\n    filter_fields = (\"question\", \"answer\")\n\n    def create(self, request, *args, **kwargs):\n        # Extract question from request data\n        question_id = request.data.get('question')\n        \n        if not question_id:\n            return Response({\"error\": \"Question ID must be provided.\"}, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)\n\n        # Try to find an existing answer for the given question\n        try:\n            answer = Answer.objects.get(question_id=question_id)\n            serializer = self.get_serializer(answer, data=request.data)\n            if serializer.is_valid():\n                serializer.save()\n                return Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)\n            else:\n                return Response(serializer.errors, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)\n        except Answer.DoesNotExist:\n            # If no existing answer, create a new one\n            return super().create(request, *args, **kwargs)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Check if `question_id` is provided:** This is crucial for identifying the correct `Answer` object, as it is a one-to-one relationship with `Question`.\n- **Try to get existing `Answer`:** Use `Answer.objects.get(question_id=question_id)` to attempt to retrieve an existing answer.\n- **Update if exists:** If an `Answer` is found, use the serializer to update it. If the serializer is valid, save the changes.\n- **Handle `Answer.DoesNotExist`:** If no existing `Answer` is found, call the superclass's `create` method to handle the creation of a new answer.\n\nThis approach ensures that your POST request to `api/answers` will either update an existing answer or create a new one, depending on whether an existing answer for the given `question_id` is found."
