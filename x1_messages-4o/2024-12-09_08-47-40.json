        "content": "Certainly! Below is a simple example of a web page that takes two numbers as input and displays their sum using HTML and PHP.\n\n### HTML and PHP Code:\n\nCreate a file named `sum.html` and add the following HTML code:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Sum Calculator</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Sum Calculator</h1>\n    <form action=\"sum.php\" method=\"post\">\n        <label for=\"num1\">Enter first number:</label>\n        <input type=\"number\" id=\"num1\" name=\"num1\" required><br><br>\n        \n        <label for=\"num2\">Enter second number:</label>\n        <input type=\"number\" id=\"num2\" name=\"num2\" required><br><br>\n        \n        <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Calculate Sum\">\n    </form>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nCreate another file named `sum.php` and add the following PHP code:\n\n```php\n<?php\nif ($_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"] == \"POST\") {\n    // Retrieve the numbers from the form\n    $num1 = $_POST['num1'];\n    $num2 = $_POST['num2'];\n\n    // Calculate the sum\n    $sum = $num1 + $num2;\n\n    // Display the result\n    echo \"<h1>Result</h1>\";\n    echo \"<p>The sum of $num1 and $num2 is: $sum</p>\";\n    echo \"<a href='sum.html'>Calculate Again</a>\";\n}\n?>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **sum.html**: This file contains a simple HTML form that allows users to input two numbers. When the form is submitted, it sends a POST request to `sum.php`.\n\n2. **sum.php**: This PHP script processes the form data. It retrieves the numbers from the POST request, calculates their sum, and then displays the result.\n\n3. **Form Handling**: The PHP script checks if the request method is POST to ensure it only processes the form submission.\n\n4. **User Feedback**: After calculating the sum, the PHP script displays the result and provides a link to return to the form for another calculation.\n\nTo run this example, you need a server with PHP support, such as a local server environment like XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP, or you can upload the files to a web server that supports PHP."
