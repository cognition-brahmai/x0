For example, if my input is 'Regex should return \"String 1\" or \"String 2\" or \"String3\"', I want the output to be 'String 1,String2,String3'. I have tried using the expression r'\"*\"' but it didn't work."

        "content": "To extract strings enclosed in double quotes using Python regular expressions, you can use the `re` module with the appropriate regex pattern. The pattern you're looking for is one that matches any sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Your input string\ninput_string = 'Regex should return \"String 1\" or \"String 2\" or \"String3\"'\n\n# Regular expression pattern to find text within double quotes\npattern = r'\"(.*?)\"'\n\n# Find all occurrences of the pattern\nmatches = re.findall(pattern, input_string)\n\n# Join the matches with a comma\nresult = ','.join(matches)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The `r'\"(.*?)\"'` pattern is used to match text inside double quotes.\n  - `\"` matches the literal double quote character.\n  - `(.*?)` is a non-greedy match (indicated by `?`) that captures any character (`.`) zero or more times (`*`).\n  - The parentheses `()` are used to capture the text inside the quotes.\n  \n- `re.findall(pattern, input_string)` returns a list of all matches found in the input string.\n- `','.join(matches)` combines the list of matches into a single string, with each match separated by a comma.\n\nWith this approach, you'll get the desired output: `String 1,String 2,String3`."
