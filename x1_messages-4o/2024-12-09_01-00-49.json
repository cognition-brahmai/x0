        "content": "The error you're encountering, `ValueError: Failed to find data adapter that can handle input`, suggests that there is an issue with the types or formats of the data that you are trying to pass to the model's `fit` function. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Data Types**: Ensure that both `X` and `y` are of compatible data types. Typically, `X` should be a NumPy array or a Pandas DataFrame, and `y` should be a NumPy array, Pandas Series, or a list. The error message indicates that `y` is a list containing integers. You might want to convert `y` into a NumPy array:\n\n   ```python\n   import numpy as np\n\n   y = np.array(y)\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify Data Shapes**: Make sure that the shapes of `X` and `y` are compatible. If `X` is a 2D array with shape `(n_samples, n_features)`, then `y` should have shape `(n_samples,)` for a single-output model.\n\n3. **Check for Consistency**: Ensure that the number of samples in `X` matches the number of samples in `y`.\n\n4. **Data Normalization**: Ensure that your data is properly normalized or standardized, if necessary, depending on your model requirements.\n\n5. **Validation Data**: If you are using a validation split, ensure that the split fraction is appropriate and doesn\u2019t result in a very small validation dataset.\n\n6. **Model Compatibility**: Check if the model architecture is compatible with the input data shape. The input layer of your model should expect input with the shape that your data provides.\n\nOnce you have verified and corrected these aspects, try running the `fit` method again. If you continue to encounter issues, please provide additional details about your model architecture and data so that further assistance can be provided."
