I attempted to add a new field, called 'airport_code', and then migrate the data. However, when I ran 'makemigrations', I received the following error: 'django.db.utils.ProgrammingError: column sites_site.airport_code does not exist'. This seems strange to me as I'm trying to create this column with the migration. I've come across various solutions such as manually creating the migration file or rebuilding the database, however, these solutions are not suitable for me. How can I solve this issue?"

        "content": "This issue often arises when there's a mismatch between the database schema and the Django models, possibly due to incomplete migrations or misalignment between your models and the database. Here\u2019s a step-by-step approach to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check for Pending Migrations**:\n   Ensure that all previous migrations have been applied. You can do this by running:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py showmigrations\n   ```\n   If there are unapplied migrations, apply them using:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py migrate\n   ```\n\n2. **Clear Migrations Cache**:\n   Sometimes Django's migration framework might get confused. Clear any existing migration files and create a fresh one:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py makemigrations --empty <app_name>\n   ```\n\n3. **Remove the New Field Temporarily**:\n   Remove the `airport_code` field from your model and save it. Then, run:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py makemigrations\n   python manage.py migrate\n   ```\n   This ensures your database and models are in sync without the new field.\n\n4. **Reintroduce the Field**:\n   Add the `airport_code` field back to your `Sites` model. Ensure that you provide a default value or allow nulls if your database already has entries for `Sites`. For example:\n   ```python\n   airport_code = models.CharField(max_length=3, null=True, blank=True)\n   ```\n\n5. **Create and Apply Migrations**:\n   Now, create the migration for the new field:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py makemigrations\n   python manage.py migrate\n   ```\n\n6. **Reset Database Schema Cache**:\n   If the error persists, reset the database schema cache. In PostgreSQL, you can do this by:\n   ```sql\n   REINDEX DATABASE your_database_name;\n   ```\n\n7. **Inspect Migration Files**:\n   Open the generated migration file to ensure it includes the addition of the `airport_code` field. It should look something like:\n   ```python\n   migrations.AddField(\n       model_name='site',\n       name='airport_code',\n       field=models.CharField(max_length=3, null=True, blank=True),\n   )\n   ```\n\n8. **Database Introspection**:\n   Double-check the database schema directly using a tool like `pgAdmin` or `DBeaver` to ensure the column does not exist unexpectedly.\n\n9. **Consult Logs for Errors**:\n   Check your Django and database logs for any errors or warnings that might provide more context.\n\nFollowing these steps should help you resolve the issue without needing to manually create migration files or rebuild the database."
