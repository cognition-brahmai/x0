I have implemented two different methods to find parameters, theta, of the linear regression model: Gradient (steepest) descent and Normal equation. They should both give approximately equal theta vectors on the same data but they do not. I have implemented my code in Matlab, however, there seems to be a difference in theta(1, 1) returned by gradient descent compared to theta(1, 1) returned by the normal equation. Could there be a bug in my code causing this discrepancy?"

        "content": "There are several potential reasons for a discrepancy between the theta values obtained from gradient descent and the normal equation in linear regression. Here are some common issues to investigate:\n\n1. **Feature Scaling:** If your features are not normalized, gradient descent might converge to a different solution or take a long time to converge. Ensure that you have performed feature scaling (e.g., standardization or normalization) on your input features.\n\n2. **Learning Rate:** An inappropriate learning rate can cause gradient descent to not converge properly. If the learning rate is too high, the algorithm might overshoot the minimum; if it's too low, convergence can be very slow. Experiment with different learning rates to see if the results improve.\n\n3. **Convergence Criteria:** Ensure that your stopping criteria for gradient descent are appropriate. If you stop too early, you may not reach the optimal solution. Compare the cost function values to ensure convergence.\n\n4. **Regularization:** Check if you're using regularization in one method and not the other. Regularization can change the resulting theta values, especially the intercept term. Ensure that both methods are consistent in terms of regularization.\n\n5. **Matrix Calculations:** Double-check your matrix calculations, especially if you're using the normal equation. Ensure that you're correctly computing the pseudo-inverse of the matrix \\(X^TX\\) (or using pinv in Matlab) and that your matrix dimensions are correct.\n\n6. **Bias Term:** Ensure that you're handling the bias (intercept) term consistently. In gradient descent, you typically add a column of ones to your input matrix for the bias term. Ensure that this is also considered in the normal equation.\n\n7. **Gradient Descent Iterations:** Verify that you're running a sufficient number of iterations for gradient descent to converge.\n\n8. **Numerical Precision:** Differences in numerical precision can sometimes cause discrepancies, especially if your data have very large or very small values.\n\nBy systematically checking each of these areas, you should be able to identify and correct the source of the discrepancy between the two methods. If you provide more details about your implementations, I might be able to offer more specific advice."
