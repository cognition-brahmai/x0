        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that the `virtualenvwrapper` module is not installed in your Python environment. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Python and pip are installed**: First, make sure that both Python and pip (Python's package manager) are installed on your system.\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 --version\n   pip3 --version\n   ```\n\n   If they are not installed, you can install them using:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip\n   ```\n\n2. **Install virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper**: Use pip to install `virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper`.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip3 install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify the installation**: Check if the installation was successful by listing installed packages.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip3 list | grep virtualenv\n   ```\n\n   You should see `virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper` in the list.\n\n4. **Update your .bashrc file**: If you have already added the line `source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh` to your `.bashrc`, ensure that the path is correct. The correct path is often `/usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh`, but verify it by locating `virtualenvwrapper.sh`.\n\n   ```bash\n   which virtualenvwrapper.sh\n   ```\n\n   Use the path returned by this command in your `.bashrc` file.\n\n5. **Reload the .bashrc file**: After making changes to your `.bashrc`, reload it.\n\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bashrc\n   ```\n\n6. **Check your environment variables**: Make sure that the `VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON` environment variable is set to the correct Python executable.\n\n   ```bash\n   export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3\n   ```\n\n   Add this export statement to your `.bashrc` if it's not already there.\n\nAfter following these steps, try running the `source ~/.bashrc` command again and see if the error persists. If you continue to encounter issues, it may be worth checking for specific version compatibility or conflicts with other installed packages."
