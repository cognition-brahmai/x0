Both seem to be archives with the same Python source files, but pip, a popular package manager, is unable to install egg distributions. I am looking to distribute my packages without using PyPI, but want to use a package manager that can fetch dependencies from PyPI. What is the recommended way to distribute my packages?"

        "content": "The key differences between a source distribution (sdist) and an egg distribution (bdist_egg) in Python lie in their purposes and formats:\n\n1. **Source Distribution (sdist):**\n   - **Format:** Typically a `.tar.gz` or `.zip` archive.\n   - **Contents:** Contains the source code of the package, along with metadata such as `setup.py` and other files required to build and install the package.\n   - **Purpose:** Primarily used to distribute the source code. When installed, the package is built from source on the target system.\n   - **Compatibility:** More flexible as it can be installed on any system with the necessary build tools and dependencies, as it compiles the package from source.\n\n2. **Egg Distribution (bdist_egg):**\n   - **Format:** A `.egg` file, which is a binary distribution format.\n   - **Contents:** Pre-built package that includes the compiled Python code (`.pyc` files), metadata, and dependencies.\n   - **Purpose:** Designed to be easily installed without needing to compile the package from source, which can be faster.\n   - **Compatibility:** Can be less portable across different systems and Python versions compared to source distributions.\n\nAs for the recommended way to distribute your packages without using PyPI but still fetching dependencies from PyPI, you should consider the following approach:\n\n- **Use Wheels (bdist_wheel):**\n  - **Advantages:** Wheels (`.whl`) are the standard for Python distribution as they are a binary format that's faster to install than source distributions and more portable than eggs. They support better cross-platform compatibility and dependency management.\n  - **Tooling:** Tools like `pip` are optimized to handle wheels, making installation easier and often faster since there is no need to compile the package during installation.\n\nTo distribute your packages:\n\n1. **Build a Wheel:** Use the command `python setup.py bdist_wheel` to create a wheel file from your package.\n2. **Host Your Package:** You can host your wheel files on a private repository, a simple HTTP server, or a private package index.\n3. **Install with pip:** Use `pip` to install your package directly from your hosted location, specifying dependencies that can be fetched from PyPI.\n\nBy distributing your package as a wheel, you leverage the full capabilities of `pip` to manage dependencies effectively while maintaining a streamlined installation process."
