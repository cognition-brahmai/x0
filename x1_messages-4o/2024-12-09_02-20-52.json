I've attempted this with the following code: \n```python\nclass Animal:\n    SIZES=[\"Huge\",\"Big\",\"Medium\",\"Small\"]\n\nclass Horse(Animal):\n    def printSize(self):\n        print(Animal.SIZES[1])\n```\nIn this case, the class `Horse` inherits from `Animal`. However, I'm finding the need to write \"Animal.\" before the constant variable cumbersome. Is there a more efficient way to achieve this, preferably without having to reference the parent class each time?"

        "content": "Certainly! If you want to use the class constants more conveniently in subclasses without having to reference the parent class explicitly, you can use the class itself or the `self` keyword within the subclass. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using the class name**: Reference the constant directly using the subclass name. This works because the subclass inherits the class variable from the parent class.\n\n```python\nclass Animal:\n    SIZES = [\"Huge\", \"Big\", \"Medium\", \"Small\"]\n\nclass Horse(Animal):\n    def printSize(self):\n        print(Horse.SIZES[1])\n\n# Usage\nh = Horse()\nh.printSize()  # Output: Big\n```\n\n2. **Using the `self` keyword**: This allows you to access the class variable through an instance of the subclass. This way, you don't need to hard-code the class name, making it more flexible.\n\n```python\nclass Animal:\n    SIZES = [\"Huge\", \"Big\", \"Medium\", \"Small\"]\n\nclass Horse(Animal):\n    def printSize(self):\n        print(self.SIZES[1])\n\n# Usage\nh = Horse()\nh.printSize()  # Output: Big\n```\n\nBoth options allow you to avoid explicitly writing the parent class name while still accessing the inherited class variable. Using `self` is more flexible, especially if you anticipate further subclassing or want to make the code more reusable."
