My problem arises when I try to evaluate the predicted results. Here's what my true data looks like: `array([1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])`. And my predicted data is: `array([ 0.07094605,  0.1994941 , 0.19270157, 0.13379635, 0.04654469, 0.09212494, 0.19952108, 0.12884365, 0.15685076, -0.01274453, 0.32167554, 0.32167554, -0.10023553, 0.09819648, -0.06755516, 0.25390082, 0.17248324])`. The code I'm using is `accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred, normalize=False)`. However, I'm receiving a `ValueError: Can't handle mix of binary and continuous target`. How can I solve this error?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering stems from attempting to use the `accuracy_score` metric on continuous predictions produced by a linear regression model. The `accuracy_score` metric is designed for classification problems, where predictions are discrete class labels. However, linear regression produces continuous outputs, which is why you're getting a mix of binary and continuous targets error.\n\nHere's how you can address this issue:\n\n1. **Convert Continuous Predictions to Class Labels**: Since your true labels are binary (0s and 1s), you should convert your continuous predictions to binary class labels. You can do this by applying a threshold, commonly 0.5, to your predicted values.\n\n   ```python\n   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n   import numpy as np\n\n   # Your true labels\n   y_true = np.array([1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n\n   # Your predicted continuous values\n   y_pred_continuous = np.array([0.07094605, 0.1994941, 0.19270157, 0.13379635, 0.04654469, 0.09212494,\n                                 0.19952108, 0.12884365, 0.15685076, -0.01274453, 0.32167554, 0.32167554,\n                                 -0.10023553, 0.09819648, -0.06755516, 0.25390082, 0.17248324])\n\n   # Convert continuous predictions to binary using a threshold of 0.5\n   y_pred_binary = (y_pred_continuous >= 0.5).astype(int)\n\n   # Calculate accuracy\n   accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred_binary)\n   print(\"Accuracy:\", accuracy)\n   ```\n\n2. **Consider Using Appropriate Metrics**: Since you are using a regression model, you might also want to evaluate your model using regression metrics like `mean_squared_error`, `mean_absolute_error`, or `r2_score`. However, if your primary goal is classification accuracy, ensure that your model selection aligns with the problem type.\n\nBy converting your continuous predictions to binary class labels, you align the predictions with the true labels, allowing you to compute accuracy accurately."
