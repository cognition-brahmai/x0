        "content": "Certainly! A common example to demonstrate the performance difference between CPU and GPU is matrix multiplication. This operation is computationally intensive and can leverage the parallel processing capabilities of a GPU for significant performance gains. Below are short code samples for matrix multiplication on both the CPU and GPU.\n\n### CPU Version (using g++)\n\nThis example uses a straightforward triple-nested loop for matrix multiplication. It\u2019s simple but not optimized for performance, illustrating how a GPU can outperform it with massive parallelism.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <chrono>\n\nvoid matrixMultiplyCPU(const std::vector<std::vector<float>>& A, \n                       const std::vector<std::vector<float>>& B, \n                       std::vector<std::vector<float>>& C, \n                       int N) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < N; ++j) {\n            C[i][j] = 0;\n            for (int k = 0; k < N; ++k) {\n                C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    const int N = 1024; // Size of the matrix\n    std::vector<std::vector<float>> A(N, std::vector<float>(N, 1.0f));\n    std::vector<std::vector<float>> B(N, std::vector<float>(N, 1.0f));\n    std::vector<std::vector<float>> C(N, std::vector<float>(N, 0.0f));\n\n    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n    matrixMultiplyCPU(A, B, C, N);\n    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n    \n    std::chrono::duration<double> duration = end - start;\n    std::cout << \"CPU Time: \" << duration.count() << \" seconds\" << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### GPU Version (using CUDA with nvcc)\n\nThe GPU version uses CUDA to perform matrix multiplication in parallel. It divides the work among many threads, showcasing the GPU's ability to handle large-scale computations effectively.\n\n```cuda\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <chrono>\n\n__global__ void matrixMultiplyGPU(float* A, float* B, float* C, int N) {\n    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;\n    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;\n    \n    if (row < N && col < N) {\n        float value = 0;\n        for (int k = 0; k < N; ++k) {\n            value += A[row * N + k] * B[k * N + col];\n        }\n        C[row * N + col] = value;\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    const int N = 1024; // Size of the matrix\n    size_t bytes = N * N * sizeof(float);\n\n    std::vector<float> h_A(N * N, 1.0f);\n    std::vector<float> h_B(N * N, 1.0f);\n    std::vector<float> h_C(N * N, 0.0f);\n\n    float *d_A, *d_B, *d_C;\n    cudaMalloc(&d_A, bytes);\n    cudaMalloc(&d_B, bytes);\n    cudaMalloc(&d_C, bytes);\n\n    cudaMemcpy(d_A, h_A.data(), bytes, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);\n    cudaMemcpy(d_B, h_B.data(), bytes, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);\n\n    dim3 threadsPerBlock(16, 16);\n    dim3 blocksPerGrid((N + threadsPerBlock.x - 1) / threadsPerBlock.x, \n                       (N + threadsPerBlock.y - 1) / threadsPerBlock.y);\n\n    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n    matrixMultiplyGPU<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_A, d_B, d_C, N);\n    cudaDeviceSynchronize();\n    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();\n\n    cudaMemcpy(h_C.data(), d_C, bytes, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);\n\n    std::chrono::duration<double> duration = end - start;\n    std::cout << \"GPU Time: \" << duration.count() << \" seconds\" << std::endl;\n\n    cudaFree(d_A);\n    cudaFree(d_B);\n    cudaFree(d_C);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Notes:\n- Ensure your system is equipped with a CUDA-capable GPU and the appropriate CUDA toolkit installed.\n- The GPU code divides the matrix into blocks and threads. Each thread computes one element of the output matrix `C`, allowing the GPU to perform many operations simultaneously.\n- Adjust the matrix size (`N`) to fit your GPU's memory and capabilities.\n- The CPU code is intentionally unoptimized to highlight the performance difference. Optimized CPU implementations (e.g., using SIMD instructions or multi-threading) can also be significantly faster.\n\nThis example should clearly show the performance advantage of the GPU for matrix multiplication, especially with larger matrices."
