        "content": "I am trying to implement the Softmax function with a numpy vector of floats. However, when I try to run my code I get an overflow error due to the `np.exp(out_vec)` line. I found that `np.exp(709)` is a number, but `np.exp(710)` is considered to be `np.inf`. To avoid the overflow error, I modified my code, but now I am receiving a RuntimeWarning: `invalid value encountered in greater out_vec[out_vec > 709] = 709`. What is wrong with the line I added? Here's my code:\n\n```python\nout_vec[out_vec > 709] = 709 #prevent np.exp overflow\nnumerator = np.exp(out_vec)\ndenominator = np.sum(np.exp(out_vec))\nout_vec = numerator/denominator\n```\n\nThe error message is `RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in greater out_vec[out_vec > 709] = 709`"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is likely due to the fact that you're modifying `out_vec` in place. When you attempt to modify elements of an array in place based on a condition, sometimes the operation can produce unexpected results, especially if `out_vec` contains `NaN` or `Inf` values before the operation. \n\nTo address the overflow issue in the softmax calculation, you can apply a more numerically stable approach by subtracting the maximum value from the vector before applying the exponential function. This won't affect the result of the softmax but will prevent overflow. Here's an improved version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef softmax(out_vec):\n    # Subtract the maximum value from out_vec for numerical stability\n    max_val = np.max(out_vec)\n    stable_out_vec = out_vec - max_val\n    \n    # Calculate exponentials\n    exp_values = np.exp(stable_out_vec)\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of exponentials\n    sum_exp_values = np.sum(exp_values)\n    \n    # Compute the softmax probability\n    softmax_result = exp_values / sum_exp_values\n    \n    return softmax_result\n\n# Example usage\nout_vec = np.array([710, 700, 800])\nsoftmax_result = softmax(out_vec)\nprint(softmax_result)\n```\n\nIn this version, by subtracting the maximum value from `out_vec`, you prevent the `np.exp` function from encountering values that are too large, which avoids overflow issues. This technique is commonly used to maintain numerical stability in softmax computations."
