        "content": "To modify your generator function to traverse a file system and yield the contents of each directory, including subdirectories and sub-subdirectories, you'll need to use a recursive approach that iterates through each subdirectory's contents before continuing. You can use the `os.path.isdir` and `os.path.isfile` functions to differentiate between directories and files. Here's a modified version of your function:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef grab_files(directory):\n    for name in os.listdir(directory):\n        full_path = os.path.join(directory, name)\n        if os.path.isdir(full_path):\n            # Recursively yield from the subdirectory\n            yield from grab_files(full_path)\n        elif os.path.isfile(full_path):\n            # Yield the file path\n            yield full_path\n        else:\n            print('Unidentified name %s. It could be a symbolic link' % full_path)\n\n# Example usage:\n# for file_path in grab_files('/your/directory/path'):\n#     print(file_path)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`yield from`**: This statement is used to yield all values from an iterable (in this case, the generator returned by `grab_files(full_path)`) without having to explicitly iterate through it.\n- **Recursion**: By calling `grab_files(full_path)` for directories, the function effectively traverses each directory and subdirectory, yielding files it finds.\n\n### Alternative Library Function:\nIf you prefer using a library function to achieve similar functionality, you can use `os.walk` or `pathlib.Path.rglob` (for Python 3.5+) to recursively list all files in a directory structure.\n\n#### Using `os.walk`:\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef grab_files_with_os_walk(directory):\n    for root, _, files in os.walk(directory):\n        for file in files:\n            yield os.path.join(root, file)\n\n# Example usage:\n# for file_path in grab_files_with_os_walk('/your/directory/path'):\n#     print(file_path)\n```\n\n#### Using `pathlib.Path.rglob`:\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\ndef grab_files_with_rglob(directory):\n    path = Path(directory)\n    for file_path in path.rglob('*'):  # This will include all files\n        if file_path.is_file():\n            yield str(file_path)\n\n# Example usage:\n# for file_path in grab_files_with_rglob('/your/directory/path'):\n#     print(file_path)\n```\n\nBoth `os.walk` and `pathlib.Path.rglob` provide a convenient way to traverse a directory tree and list all files recursively. The choice depends on your preference and the specific requirements of your use case."
