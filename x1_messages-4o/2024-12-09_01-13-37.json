The code is as follows:\n\n```python\nalist.sort(cmp_items)\n\ndef cmp_items(a, b):\n    if a.foo > b.foo:\n        return 1\n    elif a.foo == b.foo:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return -1\n```\nThis code works, but I have not been able to find this documented anywhere in the Python documentation. Most people seem to use `sorted()` for custom sorting. Could someone explain how this code works?"

        "content": "The code you provided uses an older way of sorting lists in Python that was common in Python 2 but is no longer supported in Python 3. In Python 2, the `list.sort()` method and the `sorted()` function could accept a `cmp` parameter, which allowed you to provide a custom comparison function like `cmp_items` in your example.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how it works:\n\n- `cmp_items(a, b)` is a comparison function that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`. It returns a positive number if `a` should come after `b`, zero if they are considered equal in terms of sorting, and a negative number if `a` should come before `b`.\n\n- In your function, it compares the attribute `foo` of the objects `a` and `b`. If `a.foo` is greater than `b.foo`, it returns 1, indicating that `a` should come after `b`. If they are equal, it returns 0, and if `a.foo` is less than `b.foo`, it returns -1.\n\nIn Python 3, the `cmp` parameter was removed, and instead, you should use the `key` parameter to specify a function that returns the value to be used for sorting. You can refactor the code using the `key` parameter as follows:\n\n```python\nalist.sort(key=lambda x: x.foo)\n```\n\nThis version of the code uses a lambda function to extract the `foo` attribute from each element in the list and uses it as the key for sorting. This is the recommended way to perform custom sorting in Python 3."
