I am considering whether these tests should be in different packages, have different filenames, and/or include certain docstring comments."

        "content": "In Python, while there isn't a strict standard convention to distinguish between unit tests and integration tests, there are commonly adopted practices that can help you organize and differentiate them effectively within your project structure. Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. **Separate Directories**: One of the most common practices is to separate unit tests and integration tests into different directories within your `test` directory. For example:\n   ```\n   package/\n       __init__.py\n       module_1.py\n       module_2.py\n       module_n.py\n       test/\n           __init__.py\n           unit/\n               __init__.py\n               test_module_1.py\n               test_module_2.py\n               test_module_n.py\n           integration/\n               __init__.py\n               test_integration_1.py\n               test_integration_2.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Naming Conventions**: Use naming conventions to clearly distinguish between unit and integration tests. For instance, prefix integration test files with `test_integration_` or suffix them with `_integration`.\n\n3. **Docstrings and Comments**: Add docstrings or comments at the beginning of your test files or test cases to indicate the type of test. This helps developers quickly understand the purpose of the tests.\n\n4. **Test Framework Annotations**: If you're using a testing framework like `pytest`, you can use markers to differentiate tests. For example, you can create custom markers:\n   ```python\n   # In your pytest configuration (pytest.ini or conftest.py)\n   [pytest]\n   markers =\n       unit: marks unit tests\n       integration: marks integration tests\n   ```\n\n   Then, in your test files, you can use these markers:\n   ```python\n   import pytest\n\n   @pytest.mark.unit\n   def test_some_unit_function():\n       # Unit test code\n\n   @pytest.mark.integration\n   def test_some_integration_scenario():\n       # Integration test code\n   ```\n\n5. **Configuration Files**: Use configuration files (like `tox.ini`, `pytest.ini`) to define and manage how different types of tests are run.\n\n6. **Test Runner Options**: Configure your test runner to execute different types of tests separately. For example, you can run only unit tests or only integration tests using command-line options with `pytest`:\n   ```bash\n   pytest -m unit  # Run only unit tests\n   pytest -m integration  # Run only integration tests\n   ```\n\nBy organizing your tests in this way, you can maintain a clear separation between unit and integration tests, making it easier for others to understand and contribute to your codebase."
