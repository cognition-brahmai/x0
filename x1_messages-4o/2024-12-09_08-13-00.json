By setting `default=True`, the checkbox will be checked by default in forms generated from your model. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass YourModel(models.Model):\n    your_boolean_field = models.BooleanField(default=True)\n```\n\nWith this configuration, when you create a new instance of `YourModel` using a form, the checkbox corresponding to `your_boolean_field` will be checked by default.\n\nIf you are using a Django form and want to ensure the checkbox is checked by default when rendering the form, you can also set the initial value for the form field:\n\n```python\nfrom django import forms\nfrom .models import YourModel\n\nclass YourModelForm(forms.ModelForm):\n    class Meta:\n        model = YourModel\n        fields = ['your_boolean_field']\n\n    your_boolean_field = forms.BooleanField(initial=True)\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that the checkbox is checked by default when the form is rendered, regardless of the default value set at the model level."
