Candle holder - It could be either store-bought or handmade. Candle holders are commonly available in stores, but they are also popular DIY or handcrafted items.\n2. iPhone case - Typically, this is a store-bought item. Most iPhone cases are mass-produced and sold in stores, although handmade cases can also be crafted by artisans.\n3. Drawer organizer - Like candle holders, drawer organizers can be both store-bought or handmade. They are widely available in stores, but custom or DIY versions are also common.\n\nUltimately, the categorization depends on the specific source of each item."
