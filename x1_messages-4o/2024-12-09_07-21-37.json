The code was functioning fine previously, but now I'm receiving an error that says the module has no attribute 'parse'. The code and error I'm seeing are as follows:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/python3.2\n\nimport urllib\n\ndata = urllib.parse.urlencode({'type': 'device_code','client_id': 150792241632891})\n\n# Error\n# Traceback (most recent call last):\n#   File \"/home/rakesh/programming/test.py\", line 8, in <module>\n#     data = urllib.parse.urlencode({'type': 'device_code','client_id': 150792241632891})\n# AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'parse'\n```\n\nI have confirmed that my Python shell is using version 3.2, so I'm perplexed as to why this error is occurring. Is there something I'm missing?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that in Python 3.2, the `urllib` module does not have the `parse` submodule. The `urllib.parse` module was introduced in Python 3.3. In Python 3.2 and earlier versions, you should use the `urllib` module directly for URL encoding.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to work in Python 3.2:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/python3.2\n\nimport urllib\n\ndata = urllib.urlencode({'type': 'device_code', 'client_id': 150792241632891})\n```\n\nIn this version of Python, `urlencode` is a function directly available in the `urllib` module, not a submodule of `parse`.\n\nMake sure that you have the correct version of Python running and that the script is being executed in the environment where Python 3.2 is installed. If you plan to use newer features from later Python versions, consider upgrading your Python environment to a more recent version."
