I want to pass a sentence and get the sense of each word by referencing the wordnet library. I found a similar module in PERL, is there such a module available in NLTK Python?"

        "content": "Yes, NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) in Python provides tools for word sense disambiguation using WordNet. WordNet is a lexical database for the English language that helps in identifying the meaning of words based on their context.\n\nFor word sense disambiguation, you can use the `lesk` algorithm provided by NLTK. Here's a simple sample application that demonstrates how to use the Lesk algorithm for word sense disambiguation in Python using NLTK:\n\nFirst, you need to make sure you have NLTK installed and also download the WordNet data:\n\n```bash\npip install nltk\n```\n\nThen, download the WordNet data:\n\n```python\nimport nltk\nnltk.download('wordnet')\nnltk.download('omw-1.4')\n```\n\nHere's a sample script that uses the `lesk` function:\n\n```python\nfrom nltk.corpus import wordnet as wn\nfrom nltk.wsd import lesk\n\ndef disambiguate_word_sense(sentence):\n    words = sentence.split()\n    senses = {}\n    for word in words:\n        sense = lesk(sentence, word)\n        if sense:\n            senses[word] = sense.definition()\n        else:\n            senses[word] = None\n    return senses\n\nsentence = \"I went to the bank to deposit money\"\ndisambiguated_senses = disambiguate_word_sense(sentence)\n\nfor word, sense in disambiguated_senses.items():\n    print(f\"Word: {word}, Sense: {sense}\")\n```\n\nThis script takes a sentence, splits it into words, and attempts to determine the most appropriate sense for each word using the `lesk` function. Note that `lesk` works better with sentences that provide enough context, and it may not always provide the perfect sense due to the complexity of natural language.\n\nRemember that word sense disambiguation is a challenging task, and the Lesk algorithm, while useful, is quite basic and may not always yield the most accurate results. More sophisticated methods, such as machine learning models or deep learning approaches, might be needed for more accurate disambiguation in complex contexts."
