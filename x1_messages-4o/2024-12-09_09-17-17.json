        "content": "To design a segment of code that loops from 0 to 10 and displays the square values of each iteration, you can use a simple loop construct in your preferred programming language. Below are examples in a few popular languages:\n\n### Python\n```python\nfor i in range(11):\n    print(f\"The square of {i} is {i**2}\")\n```\n\n### JavaScript\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {\n    console.log(`The square of ${i} is ${i * i}`);\n}\n```\n\n### Java\n```java\npublic class SquareValues {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {\n            System.out.println(\"The square of \" + i + \" is \" + (i * i));\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### C++\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {\n        std::cout << \"The square of \" << i << \" is \" << (i * i) << std::endl;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### C#\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass Program {\n    static void Main() {\n        for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {\n            Console.WriteLine($\"The square of {i} is {i * i}\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can choose any of these code snippets based on your preferred programming language. Each one will loop from 0 to 10 and print the square of each number in that range."
