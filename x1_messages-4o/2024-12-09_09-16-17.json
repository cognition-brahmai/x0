        "content": "To find the maximum value of the quadratic equation \\( f(x) = 5x^2 - 3x + 4 \\) using MATLAB, you'll first need to understand that this is a parabolic function. Since the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is positive (5), the parabola opens upwards, indicating that the function does not have a maximum but a minimum. However, if you're looking to find the vertex, which in this case will give you the minimum value, you can do so using calculus or by completing the square.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can approach this problem in MATLAB:\n\n1. **Symbolic Calculation**: You can use MATLAB's symbolic math capabilities to find the vertex of the parabola which will give you the minimum value.\n\n```matlab\nsyms x\nf = 5*x^2 - 3*x + 4;\ndf = diff(f, x);\ncritical_points = solve(df == 0, x);\nf_min = double(subs(f, x, critical_points));\ndisp(['The minimum value of f(x) is: ', num2str(f_min)]);\n```\n\n2. **Using Built-in Functions**: Alternatively, you can use MATLAB's built-in functions to evaluate the function at different points to find the minimum:\n\n```matlab\n% Define the function\nf = @(x) 5*x.^2 - 3*x + 4;\n\n% Use fminbnd to find the minimum value of the function over a given interval\nx_min = fminbnd(f, -10, 10);\nf_min = f(x_min);\n\ndisp(['The minimum value of f(x) is: ', num2str(f_min), ' at x = ', num2str(x_min)]);\n```\n\nIn this script, `fminbnd` is used to find the minimum of the function within a specified interval. Since the function is a parabola opening upwards, `fminbnd` will provide the x-coordinate of the vertex, which corresponds to the minimum value of the function.\n\nRemember to adjust the interval in `fminbnd` if you have a specific range of interest for \\( x \\)."
