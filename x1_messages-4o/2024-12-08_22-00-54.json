        "content": "Certainly! While I can't create an actual Excel file, I can describe how you might structure the data for Nasdaq's performance analysis and provide a conceptual overview.\n\n### Excel Table Structure for Nasdaq's Performance\n\n1. **Columns**:\n   - Date\n   - Closing Price\n   - Daily Return (%)\n   - Market Capitalization (in billions)\n   - Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E)\n   - Dividend Yield (%)\n   - Volume\n   - 52-Week High\n   - 52-Week Low\n\n2. **Sample Data**:\n   - | Date       | Closing Price | Daily Return (%) | Market Cap (B) | P/E Ratio | Dividend Yield (%) | Volume   | 52-Week High | 52-Week Low |\n     |------------|---------------|------------------|----------------|-----------|-------------------|----------|--------------|-------------|\n     | 2023-10-01 | 15,000        | 0.5              | 19,000         | 28        | 1.2               | 200M     | 16,000       | 12,000      |\n\n### JSON Format for Investor Sentiment Study\n\n```json\n{\n  \"study\": {\n    \"title\": \"Investor Sentiment Towards Nasdaq\",\n    \"date\": \"2023-09-30\",\n    \"sample_size\": 1000,\n    \"key_insights\": [\n      {\n        \"sentiment\": \"Positive\",\n        \"percentage\": 55\n      },\n      {\n        \"sentiment\": \"Neutral\",\n        \"percentage\": 30\n      },\n      {\n        \"sentiment\": \"Negative\",\n        \"percentage\": 15\n      }\n    ],\n    \"remarks\": \"Overall investor sentiment remains cautiously optimistic with a majority feeling positive about future growth prospects.\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### SQL Database Comparison of Stock Exchanges\n\nTo compare Nasdaq's performance with other exchanges, you might create a SQL table like this:\n\n**SQL Table: Global_Stock_Exchange_Performance**\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE Global_Stock_Exchange_Performance (\n    Exchange_Name VARCHAR(50),\n    Average_Return_Percentage FLOAT,\n    Market_Cap_Billions FLOAT,\n    P_E_Ratio FLOAT,\n    Dividend_Yield_Percentage FLOAT,\n    Trading_Volume_Millions INT\n);\n```\n\n**Sample Data Insert**\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO Global_Stock_Exchange_Performance\n(Exchange_Name, Average_Return_Percentage, Market_Cap_Billions, P_E_Ratio, Dividend_Yield_Percentage, Trading_Volume_Millions)\nVALUES\n('Nasdaq', 12.5, 19_000, 28, 1.2, 200),\n('NYSE', 10.3, 25_000, 22, 1.5, 250),\n('LSE', 8.7, 3_500, 18, 2.0, 150),\n('HKEX', 9.5, 4_200, 20, 1.8, 180);\n```\n\n### Insights and Comparison\n\n- **Nasdaq vs. NYSE**: Nasdaq has a higher average return percentage compared to NYSE but a slightly lower dividend yield.\n- **Nasdaq vs. LSE**: Nasdaq outperforms LSE significantly in terms of market cap and average return.\n- **Overall**: Nasdaq is a leading exchange with strong returns and market capitalization, attracting technology-focused investors.\n\nThis structured format provides a comprehensive view of Nasdaq's performance and comparison with other global exchanges while offering insights into investor sentiment."
