What is the suitable way to merge these data frames by index without duplicating the common columns? I want to avoid doing this manually as each data frame has around 90 columns. When I tried using the merge function like this: `dfNew = merge(df, df2, left_index=True, right_index=True, how='outer')`, it resulted in duplicate columns 'currency_x', 'adj_date_x', 'currency_y', 'adj_date_y'. How can I avoid this?"

        "content": "To merge two data frames by index in Pandas without duplicating the common columns, you can use the `join` method which is specifically designed for joining on indexes. Additionally, you can use the `combine_first` function to manage overlapping columns effectively if you want to prioritize values from one data frame over the other. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using `join`**: This method allows you to join two data frames on their indexes without duplicating columns. You can specify suffixes for overlapping columns, but since you want to avoid duplicates, you can drop the unwanted columns after the join.\n\n```python\n# Assuming df and df2 are your data frames\ndfNew = df.join(df2, lsuffix='_left', rsuffix='_right')\n\n# Drop duplicated columns if necessary\ncolumns_to_drop = [col for col in dfNew.columns if col.endswith('_right')]\ndfNew = dfNew.drop(columns=columns_to_drop)\n```\n\n2. **Using `combine_first`**: This function is useful when you want to merge two data frames and keep the non-null values from the first one whenever there's an overlap.\n\n```python\n# Ensure df and df2 have the same index for combine_first to work properly\ndfNew = df.combine_first(df2)\n```\n\n3. **Selective Merging**: If you want more control over which columns to keep, you can merge specific columns manually after joining the data frames.\n\n```python\n# Join the data frames\ndfNew = df.join(df2, lsuffix='_df1', rsuffix='_df2')\n\n# Select columns from df1, and fill missing values with columns from df2 if needed\ndfNew['currency'] = dfNew['currency_df1'].combine_first(dfNew['currency_df2'])\ndfNew['adj_date'] = dfNew['adj_date_df1'].combine_first(dfNew['adj_date_df2'])\n\n# Drop unnecessary columns\ndfNew = dfNew.drop(['currency_df1', 'currency_df2', 'adj_date_df1', 'adj_date_df2'], axis=1)\n```\n\nChoose the method that best fits your needs depending on whether you want to prioritize one data frame's values over the other or if you simply want to join and manage columns manually."
