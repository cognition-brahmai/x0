Here's the Python code I have used:\n\n```python\ndef isGrafting(a):\n  for i in xrange(1, int(ceil(log10(a))) + 2):\n    if a == floor((sqrt(a) * 10**(i-1)) % 10**int(ceil(log10(a)))):\n      return 1\n\na = 0\nwhile(1):\n  if (isGrafting(a)):\n    print \"%d %.15f\" % (a, sqrt(a))\n  a += 1\n```\n\nThis code fails to find at least one known Grafting number, `9999999998 => 99999.99998999999999949999999994999999999374999999912...`. It seems to lose precision after multiplying by `10**5`. I've also written a short C++ program to confirm if the issue is due to my CPU truncating the floating point number or if it's an issue with Python. Is there a way to work around this under Python, or do I need to switch to C and use GMP or a similar library?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing with floating point precision in Python is quite common, especially when dealing with large numbers and precision-sensitive operations. Python's built-in floating-point arithmetic is based on the IEEE 754 standard, which can lead to precision issues for numbers with a lot of digits. To address this, you can use Python's `decimal` module, which provides arbitrary precision arithmetic. This should help you avoid precision loss in your calculations.\n\nHere's how you could modify your code to use the `decimal` module:\n\n```python\nfrom decimal import Decimal, getcontext\n\n# Set the precision to a high number of significant digits\ngetcontext().prec = 50\n\ndef isGrafting(a):\n    a_decimal = Decimal(a)\n    sqrt_a = a_decimal.sqrt()\n    num_digits = len(str(a))\n    \n    for i in range(1, num_digits + 2):\n        multiplier = Decimal(10) ** (i - 1)\n        mod_value = Decimal(10) ** num_digits\n        if a == int((sqrt_a * multiplier) % mod_value):\n            return True\n    return False\n\na = 0\nwhile True:\n    if isGrafting(a):\n        sqrt_a = Decimal(a).sqrt()\n        print(f\"{a} {sqrt_a:.15f}\")\n    a += 1\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Decimal Module**: This code uses the `decimal` module for high-precision arithmetic. The precision is set to 50 significant digits which should be sufficient for your needs.\n2. **Type Conversion**: Convert integers to `Decimal` for calculations involving square roots and modulo operations.\n3. **Range Function**: Updated the `xrange` to `range` since Python 3 uses `range`.\n\nThis should help you find Grafting numbers more reliably by avoiding floating-point precision issues. If performance becomes a concern with the `decimal` module, you might still consider using a C or C++ library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, such as GMP, but the `decimal` module should be sufficient for many cases."
