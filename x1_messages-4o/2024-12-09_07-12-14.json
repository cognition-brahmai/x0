Here is the code I used earlier which worked perfectly using urllib2:\n```\nimg = urllib2.urlopen(settings.STATICMAP_URL.format(**data))\nwith open(path, 'w') as f:\n    f.write(img.read())\n```\nNow, I am trying to achieve the same using the requests module, but the following code is not working:\n```\nr = requests.get(settings.STATICMAP_URL.format(**data))\nif r.status_code == 200:\n    img = r.raw.read()\n    with open(path, 'w') as f:\n        f.write(img)\n```\nCan you help me understand what attribute from the response to use from requests?"

        "content": "Certainly! The issue you're facing is likely due to the way you're handling the response content and writing it to a file. When using the `requests` module, the raw response data is accessed using `r.content` rather than `r.raw.read()`. Additionally, when writing binary data to a file, you should open the file in binary mode by using `'wb'` instead of `'w'`.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to correctly download and save the image using the `requests` module:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# Make the GET request to the URL\nr = requests.get(settings.STATICMAP_URL.format(**data), stream=True)\n\n# Check if the request was successful\nif r.status_code == 200:\n    # Open the file in binary write mode\n    with open(path, 'wb') as f:\n        # Write the content of the response to the file\n        f.write(r.content)\n```\n\nKey points:\n- Use `r.content` to get the content of the response as bytes.\n- Open the file with `'wb'` mode to write binary data.\n- The `stream=True` parameter in `requests.get()` is optional but recommended for large files, as it allows you to download the file in chunks. If the file is large, you might want to iterate over the content in chunks to avoid using too much memory:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# Make the GET request to the URL with streaming\nr = requests.get(settings.STATICMAP_URL.format(**data), stream=True)\n\n# Check if the request was successful\nif r.status_code == 200:\n    # Open the file in binary write mode\n    with open(path, 'wb') as f:\n        # Iterate over the response in chunks\n        for chunk in r.iter_content(chunk_size=8192):\n            # Filter out keep-alive chunks\n            if chunk:\n                # Write the chunk to the file\n                f.write(chunk)\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that you handle both large and small files efficiently."
