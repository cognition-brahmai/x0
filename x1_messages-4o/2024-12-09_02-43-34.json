For example, I have data in this format:\n\n```python\ndata = [\n('r1', 'c1', avg11, stdev11),\n('r1', 'c2', avg12, stdev12),\n('r2', 'c1', avg21, stdev21),\n('r2', 'c2', avg22, stdev22)\n]\n```\nI would like to put this data into a pandas DataFrame with rows named by the first column and columns named by the second column. I have tried using the following code to create the DataFrame and set the row names:\n\n```python\npandas.DataFrame([x[1:] for x in data], index = [x[0] for x in data])\n```\nHowever, this results in a 3x4 matrix, which is not what I want. How can I modify my approach to get a 2x2 matrix instead? Additionally, is there a more efficient way to set the row labels without explicitly omitting them?\n\nI also noticed that I might need to create two separate DataFrames, one for averages and one for standard deviations. Is that correct? Or is there a way to store a list of values in each cell?"

        "content": "To construct a `pandas` DataFrame from your list of tuples where each tuple represents a row, a column, and values, you should consider creating two separate DataFrames: one for the averages and one for the standard deviations. Alternatively, you can create a MultiIndex DataFrame if you want to store both values in a single DataFrame, but it might be more complex to work with.\n\nHere's how you can create two separate DataFrames for averages and standard deviations:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample data\ndata = [\n    ('r1', 'c1', 'avg11', 'stdev11'),\n    ('r1', 'c2', 'avg12', 'stdev12'),\n    ('r2', 'c1', 'avg21', 'stdev21'),\n    ('r2', 'c2', 'avg22', 'stdev22')\n]\n\n# Create dictionaries for averages and standard deviations\navg_dict = {}\nstdev_dict = {}\n\nfor row, col, avg, stdev in data:\n    if row not in avg_dict:\n        avg_dict[row] = {}\n        stdev_dict[row] = {}\n    avg_dict[row][col] = avg\n    stdev_dict[row][col] = stdev\n\n# Create DataFrames\navg_df = pd.DataFrame(avg_dict).T\nstdev_df = pd.DataFrame(stdev_dict).T\n\nprint(\"Averages DataFrame:\")\nprint(avg_df)\nprint(\"\\nStandard Deviations DataFrame:\")\nprint(stdev_df)\n```\n\nThis code will create two separate DataFrames:\n\n- `avg_df` for averages\n- `stdev_df` for standard deviations\n\nBoth DataFrames will have rows named by the first element of the tuples and columns named by the second element.\n\nIf you want to store both values in a single DataFrame using a MultiIndex, here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample data\ndata = [\n    ('r1', 'c1', 'avg11', 'stdev11'),\n    ('r1', 'c2', 'avg12', 'stdev12'),\n    ('r2', 'c1', 'avg21', 'stdev21'),\n    ('r2', 'c2', 'avg22', 'stdev22')\n]\n\n# Create a dictionary with tuples as values\nmulti_dict = {}\nfor row, col, avg, stdev in data:\n    if row not in multi_dict:\n        multi_dict[row] = {}\n    multi_dict[row][col] = (avg, stdev)\n\n# Create MultiIndex DataFrame\nmulti_df = pd.DataFrame(multi_dict).T\nmulti_df.columns = pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples([(col, 'avg') for col in multi_df.columns] + [(col, 'stdev') for col in multi_df.columns])\n\nprint(\"MultiIndex DataFrame:\")\nprint(multi_df)\n```\n\nThis will give you a DataFrame where each cell contains a tuple `(average, standard deviation)`. You can choose the method that best fits your needs."
