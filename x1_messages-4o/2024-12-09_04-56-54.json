I am noticing this issue only with three dots, other combinations seem to work fine. I am using iPython in PyCharm. Here's the code I used:\n\n```python\nprint(\"one moment...\")\none moment...\nprint(\"...\")\nprint(\"..\")\n..\nprint(\"...abc...\")\nabc...\nprint(\"\\u2026\")\n\u2026\n```\n\nWhy is this occurring, and why does print(\"...\") seem to be parsed differently?"

        "content": "The issue you are experiencing with `print(\"...\")` not displaying as expected in iPython within PyCharm is quite unusual, as the `print()` function should display the characters exactly as they are in the string, including the ellipsis `...`.\n\nHere are a few potential reasons and solutions to consider:\n\n1. **iPython or PyCharm Bug**: It might be a rendering glitch specific to the combination of iPython and PyCharm. Try running the same script in a different Python environment, such as a regular Python interpreter, to see if the issue persists.\n\n2. **Encoding Issues**: Ensure that your terminal or console is set to handle UTF-8 encoding properly. However, this usually affects more complex characters, not simple dots.\n\n3. **Invisible Characters**: Check for any invisible or non-printable characters in your code that might be affecting the output. You can use a text editor with a feature to display such characters.\n\n4. **Font or Theme Issue**: Sometimes, certain fonts or themes in the IDE might render certain characters oddly. Try changing the font or theme settings in PyCharm to see if that resolves the issue.\n\n5. **Environment Specific**: It's also possible that this issue is specific to your environment setup. Updating PyCharm or iPython, or resetting settings, might help.\n\nTo rule out these possibilities, try running a simple script in a standalone Python file outside of iPython:\n\n```python\nprint(\"...\")\n```\n\nIf it works as expected in the standard Python environment, the issue is likely specific to your iPython or PyCharm settings. If the problem persists across different environments, it might be worth reinstalling PyCharm or checking for any updates or patches available for your current version."
