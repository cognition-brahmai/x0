I want to write the arrays to the database as base64 instead of converting the arrays to a string of unicode. I am using the following code to encode a numpy array into base64, but I am struggling with decoding it back into a numpy array. How can I decode the base64 back into a numpy array if I know the dtype and the shape of the array?\n```\nimport base64\nimport numpy as np\n\nt = np.arange(25, dtype=np.float64)\ns = base64.b64encode(t.tobytes())\nr = base64.decodebytes(s)\nq = ????\n```"

        "content": "To decode the base64-encoded data back into a numpy array, you can use the `numpy.frombuffer` function. You need to know the original data type (`dtype`) and shape of the array to correctly reconstruct it. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport base64\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original array\nt = np.arange(25, dtype=np.float64)\n\n# Encoding the array to base64\ns = base64.b64encode(t.tobytes())\n\n# Decoding the base64 back to bytes\nr = base64.decodebytes(s)\n\n# Reconstructing the numpy array from the bytes\n# You need to know the dtype and shape of the original array\nq = np.frombuffer(r, dtype=np.float64).reshape(t.shape)\n\n# Check if the original and decoded arrays are the same\nprint(np.array_equal(t, q))  # Should output: True\n\nprint(q)\n```\n\nIn this example, I used `t.shape` and `t.dtype` because you know the shape and type of the original array. Make sure to replace these with the actual shape and dtype in your application context if they are stored or known from elsewhere."
