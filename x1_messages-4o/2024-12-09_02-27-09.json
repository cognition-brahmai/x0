I was able to count lowercase letters using the following code:\n\n```python\ndef n_lower_chars(string):\n    return sum(map(str.islower, string))\n```\nI want to create a similar function that counts uppercase letters, like in the example below:\n\n```python\nType word: HeLLo                                        \nCapital Letters: 3\n```\nBut when I try to modify the function to count uppercase letters, like this:\n\n```python\ndef n_upper_chars(string):\n    return sum(map(str.isupper, string))\n```\nIt produces errors. How can I fix this?"

        "content": "Your function `n_upper_chars` is actually correctly defined to count the uppercase letters in a string. The function `str.isupper` is a built-in method in Python that checks if a character is an uppercase letter, and `map` applies this method to each character in the string. The `sum` function then adds up the `True` values (which are interpreted as `1`), giving you the total count of uppercase letters.\n\nIf you're encountering errors, they might be due to something else in your code or how the function is being called. Here\u2019s how you can use your function without any errors:\n\n```python\ndef n_upper_chars(string):\n    return sum(map(str.isupper, string))\n\n# Example usage\nword = input(\"Type word: \")\ncapital_letters = n_upper_chars(word)\nprint(\"Capital Letters:\", capital_letters)\n```\n\nMake sure you run this code in a Python environment where you can input text, and it should work correctly. If you\u2019re still experiencing errors, please provide more details about the error messages you're seeing, and I can help troubleshoot further."
