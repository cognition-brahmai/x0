I understand that I need to pass an instance of the `tzinfo` class as the `tzinfo` argument to the `datetime` constructor. However, the `tzinfo` class is an abstract base class and I'm unsure of how to create a concrete subclass for it. Ideally, I would like a simple way to represent \"UTC\" as shown in this code:\n\n```python\nimport timezones\n...\nt = datetime(2015, 2, 1, 15, 16, 17, 345, timezones.UTC)\n```\n\nIs there an alternative to creating a subclass of `tzinfo` just to represent UTC?"

        "content": "Yes, there is a simpler way to represent UTC without having to create a subclass of `tzinfo`. Starting from Python 3.2, the standard library provides a built-in class called `timezone` in the `datetime` module that can be used to represent fixed offsets from UTC, including UTC itself.\n\nYou can use `datetime.timezone.utc` to get a timezone object representing UTC. Here's how you can construct a UTC `datetime` object using this:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timezone\n\n# Create a datetime object with UTC timezone\nt = datetime(2015, 2, 1, 15, 16, 17, 345, tzinfo=timezone.utc)\n\nprint(t)  # Output: 2015-02-01 15:16:17.000345+00:00\n```\n\nIn this example, `timezone.utc` provides a `tzinfo` instance that represents the UTC timezone, making it simple to create `datetime` objects that are aware of the UTC timezone without needing to define any custom subclasses."
