I have disabled the offset from the y_axis using `ax1.ticklabel_format(style = 'sci', useOffset=False)`, and attempted to put it in a scientific format. However, the output I get is `0.00355872`. I was expecting something like `3.55872...E-2` or similar. Ideally, I'd like it to be formatted like `3.55872... (on the tick label) x 10^2 (or something similar - on the axis label)`. I am aware that I could set the labels to static, but I will have many plots with different values, so it needs to be set dynamically. I also considered placing the y_axis offset as the label, but I'm not sure how to do this. How can I achieve my desired outcome?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired formatting of tick labels in scientific notation with matplotlib, you can use the `ScalarFormatter` from `matplotlib.ticker` to customize how the tick labels are formatted. Specifically, you can set the `useMathText` attribute to `True` and adjust the `set_powerlimits` method to control when scientific notation is used.\n\nHere's how you can achieve the desired format where the numbers on the tick labels are in scientific notation, and the exponent is indicated on the axis label:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.ticker as mticker\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Sample data\nx = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)\ny = np.sin(x) * 0.00355872\n\n# Create a plot\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(x, y)\n\n# Set scientific notation for y-axis\nformatter = mticker.ScalarFormatter(useMathText=True)\nformatter.set_powerlimits((-3, 3))  # Adjust the limits as needed\nax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(formatter)\n\n# Enable the offset text\nax.ticklabel_format(style='sci', axis='y', useOffset=False)\n\n# Add y-axis label\nax.set_ylabel('Value (x $10^2$)')  # Modify the exponent as needed\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- `ScalarFormatter` is used with `useMathText=True` to ensure that the tick labels are formatted in scientific notation using LaTeX-style math text.\n- `set_powerlimits((-3, 3))` is used to control when to switch to scientific notation. You can adjust these limits to suit your needs.\n- The y-axis label is manually set to include the exponent, `x $10^2$`, to reflect the scientific notation scale. You can adjust the label text to match the actual exponent used in your application.\n\nThis setup will dynamically adjust the tick labels based on the data range and ensure they are displayed in scientific notation with the exponent indicated on the axis label."
