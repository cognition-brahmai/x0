This module imports a function from `p_02_paying_debt_off_in_a_year.py`. However, I am encountering the error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '__main__.p_02_paying_debt_off_in_a_year'; '__main__' is not a package`. I've attempted to resolve this by adding an `__init__.py` file, but it hasn't worked. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering typically occurs when Python is unable to locate and import the module you specified due to incorrect module paths or directory structure. Here are several steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Directory Structure**: Ensure your directory structure is correctly set up. Your `problem_set_02` directory should look something like this:\n\n   ```\n   problem_set_02/\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 p_02_paying_debt_off_in_a_year.py\n   \u251c\u2500\u2500 p_03_using_bisection_search.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Import Statement**: In `p_03_using_bisection_search.py`, ensure you are using a relative import statement to import the function from `p_02_paying_debt_off_in_a_year.py`. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   from .p_02_paying_debt_off_in_a_year import your_function_name\n   ```\n\n   Replace `your_function_name` with the actual function you're trying to import.\n\n3. **Running the Script**: When running the script, make sure you are executing it from the parent directory of `problem_set_02` to ensure the module can be found correctly. You can do this by navigating to the parent directory and using the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m problem_set_02.p_03_using_bisection_search\n   ```\n\n   This command uses the `-m` switch to run the module as a script, which sets up the module search path correctly.\n\n4. **Python Version**: Ensure that you're using a Python version that supports relative imports. Python 3 is recommended.\n\n5. **Environment**: If you're using a virtual environment, ensure it is activated so that the correct Python interpreter and path settings are used.\n\nIf after trying these steps you're still facing issues, double-check for any typographical errors in file names and import statements. Also, ensure that there are no circular imports (where two modules attempt to import each other)."
