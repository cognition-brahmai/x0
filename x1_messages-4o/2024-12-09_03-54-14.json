I've written the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom multiprocessing import Pool\n\ndef myfunc(x):\n    return [i for i in range(x)]\n\npool=Pool()\n\nA=[]\nr = pool.map_async(myfunc, (1,2), callback=A.extend)\nr.wait()\n```\n\nI was expecting the output to be `A=[0,0,1]`, however, I'm getting `A=[[0],[0,1]]`. I know that if I have `A=[]`, `A.extend([0])` and `A.extend([0,1])` would indeed give me `A=[0,0,1]`. So, I'm trying to understand if the callback function works differently in this case. Could you explain how I can achieve `A=[0,0,1]` instead of `A=[[0],[0,1]]`?"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is due to how the `callback` function in `map_async` works with the results returned by the function you're mapping. When you use `pool.map_async`, the results from each function call are collected into a list and then passed as a single argument to the callback function.\n\nIn your code, `myfunc(x)` returns a list. So, when `map_async` is executed, it collects these lists into a larger list, resulting in a nested list structure. Specifically, `map_async` will execute `myfunc` for each item in the iterable, collect the results, and pass `[[0], [0, 1]]` to the callback function `A.extend`.\n\nThe callback `A.extend` is then called with this single argument `[[0], [0, 1]]`, and since `extend` adds each element of the iterable it is given to `A`, it results in `A` being `[[0], [0, 1]]`.\n\nTo achieve the output `A=[0,0,1]`, you need to flatten the list of results before extending `A`. You can do this by modifying your callback function to handle the flattening. Here is one way to achieve that:\n\n```python\nfrom multiprocessing import Pool\n\ndef myfunc(x):\n    return [i for i in range(x)]\n\ndef flatten_and_extend(result):\n    for sublist in result:\n        A.extend(sublist)\n\npool = Pool()\n\nA = []\nr = pool.map_async(myfunc, (1, 2), callback=flatten_and_extend)\nr.wait()\n\nprint(A)  # This should output: [0, 0, 1]\n```\n\nIn this modified version, the `flatten_and_extend` function iterates through each sublist in the `result`, extending `A` with each sublist individually. This ensures `A` is flattened as desired."
