Here's an example of how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef count_words(sentence):\n    # Split the sentence into words based on whitespace\n    words = sentence.split()\n    # Return the number of words\n    return len(words)\n\n# Example usage\nsentence = \"This is an example sentence.\"\nword_count = count_words(sentence)\nprint(f\"The number of words in the sentence is: {word_count}\")\n```\n\nIn this function, `sentence.split()` splits the sentence into a list of words using spaces as the delimiter. The `len()` function then returns the number of words in this list. This approach considers words to be sequences of characters separated by whitespace."
