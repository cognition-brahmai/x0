        "content": "Creating a Java program to read two numbers, add them, and print their sum is a straightforward task. You can achieve this using the `Scanner` class to read input from the user. Here's a simple example of how you can do it:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class SumTwoNumbers {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Create a Scanner object to read input from the console\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n\n        // Prompt the user to enter the first number\n        System.out.print(\"Enter the first number: \");\n        double number1 = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        // Prompt the user to enter the second number\n        System.out.print(\"Enter the second number: \");\n        double number2 = scanner.nextDouble();\n\n        // Calculate the sum of the two numbers\n        double sum = number1 + number2;\n\n        // Print the result\n        System.out.println(\"The sum of \" + number1 + \" and \" + number2 + \" is: \" + sum);\n\n        // Close the scanner\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Scanner Class**: We use the `Scanner` class to read input from the console. It provides methods like `nextDouble()` to read a double value from the user.\n\n2. **Prompting the User**: We ask the user to enter two numbers separately. The `System.out.print()` method is used to display a message to the user without a newline character.\n\n3. **Reading Input**: The `nextDouble()` method reads the next available double value entered by the user.\n\n4. **Calculating the Sum**: We simply add the two numbers together using the `+` operator and store the result in the `sum` variable.\n\n5. **Printing the Result**: Finally, we use `System.out.println()` to print the result, displaying the sum of the two numbers.\n\n6. **Closing the Scanner**: It's a good practice to close the `Scanner` object to free up resources.\n\nYou can compile and run this program in any Java development environment or command line to see how it works."
