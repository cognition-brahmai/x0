The error message says `File \"/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pkg_resources.py\", line 1479, in <module> register_loader-type(importlib_bootstrap.SourceFileLoader, DefaultProvider) AttributeError: module \"importlib._bootstrap\" has no attribute \"SourceFileLoader\"`.

        "content": "The error you're encountering is likely due to compatibility issues between the version of Python 3.6 and certain packages or modules that have been installed. This problem often arises when there are mismatches between the installed libraries and the Python version used on older systems like Ubuntu 14.04.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Update Python and Pip**: First, ensure that your Python and pip installations are up-to-date. You can update pip using the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Python Version**: Make sure that the default Python version is correct. You can check this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 --version\n   ```\n\n3. **Reinstall Python**: If the update doesn't resolve the issue, you might want to consider reinstalling Python. This can be done by removing the existing installation and installing it again:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get remove --purge python3\n   sudo apt-get install python3.6\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for Correct Symbolic Links**: Sometimes the symbolic links for Python may point to the wrong version. Ensure that `/usr/bin/python3` points to Python 3.6:\n\n   ```bash\n   ls -l /usr/bin/python3\n   ```\n\n   If it's incorrect, you can update it:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/python3.6 /usr/bin/python3\n   ```\n\n5. **Use Virtual Environments**: It's often best practice to use a virtual environment for Python projects. This isolates the dependencies and can prevent conflicts. You can create and activate a virtual environment using:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install python3-venv\n   python3 -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n   Then try installing the package within the virtual environment:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install packagename\n   ```\n\n6. **Reinstall `setuptools` and `pkg_resources`**: Since the error involves `pkg_resources`, try reinstalling these packages:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade setuptools\n   ```\n\nIf these steps don't resolve the issue, you may want to consider upgrading your Ubuntu version, as 14.04 is quite old and not officially supported anymore. Upgrading to a more recent version of Ubuntu will provide better support for newer Python versions and packages."
