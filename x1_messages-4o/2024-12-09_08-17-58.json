        "content": "To generate a list of all base classes in the inheritance hierarchy of a given class, such as `Foo`, you can make use of Python's built-in functions and attributes. This can be done for both new-style and old-style classes. Here's a method you can use:\n\n```python\ndef get_base_classes(cls):\n    # Initialize an empty list to hold the base classes\n    base_classes = []\n\n    # Define a recursive function to explore the base classes\n    def explore_bases(current_class):\n        # Iterate over each base class of the current class\n        for base in current_class.__bases__:\n            # If the base class is not already in the list, add it\n            if base not in base_classes:\n                base_classes.append(base)\n                # Recursively explore the base classes of the base class\n                explore_bases(base)\n\n    # Start the exploration with the initial class\n    explore_bases(cls)\n    \n    return base_classes\n\n# Example usage\nclass A:\n    pass\n\nclass B(A):\n    pass\n\nclass Foo(B):\n    pass\n\nbase_classes_list = get_base_classes(Foo)\nprint(base_classes_list)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **`__bases__` Attribute**: This attribute of a class returns a tuple containing the base classes in the inheritance hierarchy. It works for both new-style and old-style classes.\n\n2. **Recursive Function**: The function `explore_bases` is used to recursively explore each base class and its respective base classes until all are identified. This ensures that even if the class hierarchy is deep, all classes are captured.\n\n3. **Avoiding Duplicates**: By checking `if base not in base_classes`, the function avoids adding duplicate classes to the list.\n\n4. **Usage**: You can use the `get_base_classes` function by passing the class you want to check, and it will return a list of its base classes.\n\nThis approach should work for most class hierarchies you encounter."
