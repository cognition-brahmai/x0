        "content": "In Python, both `open()` and `with open()` are used to open files, but they have some differences in terms of resource management and ease of use.\n\n1. **`open()` Method:**\n   - When you use `open()`, you need to explicitly close the file using the `close()` method to release the resources. This is important to prevent resource leaks, which can happen if too many files are left open.\n   - If you forget to close the file, it can lead to issues, especially in programs that open many files or deal with large files.\n   - Example:\n     ```python\n     file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n     content = file.read()\n     file.close()\n     ```\n\n2. **`with open()` Method:**\n   - `with open()` is preferred because it automatically handles file closure. It ensures the file is properly closed when the block inside the `with` statement is exited, even if an error occurs within the block.\n   - This method is more concise and reduces the risk of forgetting to close the file.\n   - Example:\n     ```python\n     with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n         content = file.read()\n     ```\n   - The `with` statement creates a context manager that handles the setup and teardown operations, ensuring proper resource management.\n\n**Performance Impact:**\n- In terms of performance, there is no significant difference between using `open()` and `with open()`. Both methods have similar performance characteristics since they both ultimately call the underlying operating system's file handling methods.\n- The primary difference is in resource management and code readability. Using `with open()` is a more Pythonic and efficient way to handle files, as it reduces the likelihood of resource leaks and makes the code cleaner and easier to maintain.\n\nIn summary, while both methods can be used to open files, `with open()` is generally recommended for its automatic resource management and cleaner syntax."
