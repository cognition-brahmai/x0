        "content": "How can I delete records from a many-to-many (secondary) table in SQLAlchemy without affecting the records in the primary tables? Specifically, I am having difficulty deleting records from the 'PostTag' table which contains 'Post' and 'Tag' columns without deleting records from the 'Tag' table. Here are the relevant codes for my relationship table and the deletion process:\n\nThis is my relationship table:\n```python\ntags = db.Table('PostTag',\n    db.Column('Tag', db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('Tag.Id')),\n    db.Column('Post', db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('Post.Id'))\n)\ntags = db.relationship(Tag, secondary=tags, backref=db.backref('Post', lazy='dynamic'))\n```\n\nThis is how I'm deleting records:\n```python\nfrom models.Post import Post\n\nposts = Post.query.join(Post.tags).filter(Post.Id == id).all()\nif(posts):\n   return posts\nreturn False\n\nfor posttag in post[0].tags:\n    db.session.delete(posttag)\n    db.session.flush()\n```\nThe issue is that I'm also deleting records from the `Tag` table when I only want to delete records from the `PostTag` table. For example, I only want to delete records where `Post=1`. The SQL log shows that a DELETE operation was performed on the `Tag` table, which should not be there:\n```python\n297 Query  DELETE FROM `PostTag` WHERE `PostTag`.`Tag` = 14 AND `PostTag`.`Post` = 3\n297 Query  DELETE FROM `PostTag` WHERE `PostTag`.`Tag` = 14 AND `PostTag`.`Post` = 18\n297 Query  DELETE FROM `Tag` WHERE `Tag`.`Id` = 14\n```\nI found a workaround by executing SQL directly, but it is not the ORM way. Is there a better way to do this?"

        "content": "In SQLAlchemy, when you want to delete entries from a many-to-many relationship table without affecting the parent tables, you should directly manipulate the association table rather than relying on the ORM to infer the necessary operations. The issue you're encountering arises because the ORM might be interpreting your actions as an intention to delete associated `Tag` objects rather than just the association itself.\n\nHere's a way to delete entries from the `PostTag` association table without affecting the `Tag` table:\n\n1. **Access the secondary table directly**: You can perform a deletion operation directly on the `PostTag` association table using a raw SQL query via SQLAlchemy's `session.execute` method.\n\n2. **Use the `remove` method on the relationship**: If you want to stick with ORM methods, you can use the `remove` method to remove associations without affecting the related objects.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how to do it using the `session.execute` method:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import delete\n\n# Assuming `tags` is your association table\nstmt = delete(tags).where(tags.c.Post == post_id)\n\n# Execute the statement\ndb.session.execute(stmt)\ndb.session.commit()\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you want to use the ORM way with the `remove` method, you can do the following:\n\n```python\n# Assuming you have a Post object\npost = Post.query.get(post_id)\n\n# Remove all associated tags without deleting the tags themselves\nfor tag in post.tags:\n    post.tags.remove(tag)\n\ndb.session.commit()\n```\n\nIn this second approach, when you call `post.tags.remove(tag)`, SQLAlchemy will automatically generate the necessary DELETE statement for the association table without affecting the `Tag` table itself.\n\nMake sure to replace `post_id` with the actual ID of the post you want to work with. This way, you ensure that only the associations are being removed, not the `Tag` entries themselves."
