        "content": "Certainly! The \"Relative Absolute Error\" (RAE) and \"Root Relative Squared Error\" (RRSE) are commonly used metrics to evaluate the performance of regression models. They provide a normalized measure of error which allows for easier comparison across different models or datasets. Here's how they are calculated:\n\n### Relative Absolute Error (RAE)\n\nThe Relative Absolute Error is calculated as the ratio of the absolute error of the model to the absolute error of a simple predictor (like the mean of the actual values). The formula is:\n\n\\[ \n\\text{RAE} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \\hat{y}_i|}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \\bar{y}|} \n\\]\n\n- \\( y_i \\) is the actual value.\n- \\( \\hat{y}_i \\) is the predicted value by the model.\n- \\( \\bar{y} \\) is the mean of the actual values.\n- \\( n \\) is the number of data points.\n\nThe RAE is usually expressed as a percentage, so you would multiply the result by 100 to obtain the percentage form.\n\n### Root Relative Squared Error (RRSE)\n\nThe Root Relative Squared Error compares the total squared error of the model's predictions to the total squared error of a simple predictor (again, typically the mean of the actual values). The formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{RRSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}}\n\\]\n\n- The terms are defined as in the RAE.\n\nAgain, RRSE is often expressed as a percentage, so it is common to multiply by 100.\n\n### Interpretation\n\n- A lower RAE or RRSE indicates a better performing model.\n- RAE and RRSE values less than 100% suggest that the model is predicting better than the baseline predictor (mean of the actual values).\n\nThese formulas should help you compute RAE and RRSE in MATLAB for your custom algorithms.
