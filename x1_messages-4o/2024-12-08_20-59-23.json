        "content": "In LaTeX, you can typeset a matrix with specific elements in bold using the `amsmath` package, which provides various matrix environments. To make specific elements bold, you can use the `\\mathbf{}` or `\\bm{}` (from the `bm` package) command for bold math symbols. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{bm} % Optional: for bold math symbols\n\n\\begin{document}\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & \\mathbf{3} \\\\\n4 & \\bm{5} & 6 \\\\\n\\mathbf{7} & 8 & 9\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n\\end{document}\n```\n\nIn this example, the elements at positions (1,3), (2,2), and (3,1) are made bold using `\\mathbf{}` and `\\bm{}`. The `\\bm{}` command is part of the `bm` package and is useful for making bold Greek letters or other symbols that `\\mathbf{}` might not handle well. You can choose either depending on your specific requirements. \n\nMake sure to include the necessary packages at the beginning of your document, and compile your LaTeX document with a compatible engine, such as `pdflatex` or `xelatex`."
