        "content": "Yes, you can create a Python script to extract all the hyperlinks from a webpage by using the `requests` library to make a GET request and `BeautifulSoup` from the `bs4` library to parse the HTML. Here's a step-by-step guide and example script to achieve this:\n\n1. **Install Required Libraries**: If you haven't already, you'll need to install the `requests` and `beautifulsoup4` libraries. You can do this via pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests beautifulsoup4\n   ```\n\n2. **Write the Script**: Below is a simple Python script that fetches a webpage and extracts all hyperlinks.\n\n   ```python\n   import requests\n   from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n   # Function to extract hyperlinks\n   def extract_hyperlinks(url):\n       # Send a GET request to the URL\n       response = requests.get(url)\n       \n       # Check if the request was successful\n       if response.status_code == 200:\n           # Parse the page content\n           soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\n           \n           # Find all hyperlink tags (<a>)\n           links = soup.find_all('a')\n           \n           # Extract and return the href attributes\n           hyperlinks = [link.get('href') for link in links if link.get('href')]\n           return hyperlinks\n       else:\n           print(f\"Failed to retrieve the webpage. Status code: {response.status_code}\")\n           return []\n\n   # Example usage\n   url = \"https://example.com\"\n   hyperlinks = extract_hyperlinks(url)\n   \n   # Print the extracted hyperlinks\n   for link in hyperlinks:\n       print(link)\n   ```\n\n3. **Run the Script**: You can run this script by saving it to a file, for example, `extract_links.py`, and then executing it:\n\n   ```bash\n   python extract_links.py\n   ```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **requests.get(url)**: This function sends a GET request to the specified URL and retrieves the webpage content.\n- **BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')**: This initializes a BeautifulSoup object, which parses the webpage content.\n- **soup.find_all('a')**: This finds all `<a>` tags in the HTML, which are used for hyperlinks.\n- **link.get('href')**: This extracts the URL from the `href` attribute of each `<a>` tag.\n\nThis script will print all the hyperlinks found on the specified webpage. You can modify it further to filter or process the links as needed."
