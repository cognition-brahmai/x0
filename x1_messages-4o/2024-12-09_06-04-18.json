I am able to run the 'broken' script by using the command 'python script_name.py'. I thought that maybe my line ending of the hashbang got changed somehow, so I compared the line endings of a working script and the broken script via the ':set list' option in VI, but both files appear to end using the same character (a '$'). I am unsure how to proceed from here. How can I 'see' the line ending in case the 'set list' was not the right method? Also, running the script through 'dos2unix' makes it work again but I would like to know why Geany somehow converted the line endings in the first place, as I never work on a dos/windows system. The script is executable and the shebang is in there."

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is indeed related to line endings, which can be quite tricky when switching between different systems or even different editors. Here's a breakdown of what's likely happening and how you can address it:\n\n### Understanding Line Endings\n\n1. **Line Endings Explanation**:\n   - In Unix/Linux systems, the standard line ending is a Line Feed (LF), represented as `\\n`.\n   - In Windows systems, the standard line ending is a Carriage Return followed by a Line Feed (CRLF), represented as `\\r\\n`.\n\n2. **Shebang Line**:\n   - The shebang (`#!`) at the beginning of a script tells the system what interpreter to use to run the file. If there's a carriage return (`\\r`) at the end of the shebang line, it can confuse the system into thinking the interpreter's location is incorrect.\n\n### Diagnosing the Problem\n\n1. **Viewing Line Endings in VI**:\n   - The `:set list` command in `vi` shows special characters, but it might not clearly differentiate between `\\r\\n` and `\\n`.\n   - You can use `:set ff` in `vi` to check the file format (it will show `unix`, `dos`, etc.).\n\n2. **Using Other Tools**:\n   - Use `cat -v` to display non-printing characters in the terminal. This can help you see if there's a `^M` character at the end of lines, which indicates a Windows-style line ending.\n   - You can also use `od -c script_name.py | less` to get a more detailed view of the characters, which will show `\\r` if present.\n\n### Why Geany Might Change Line Endings\n\n- **Text Editor Configuration**: Geany or any other text editor might have settings that automatically convert line endings based on the file or project settings. Check the preferences in Geany for any options related to line endings or file formats.\n  \n- **File Origin**: If the file was originally created or edited on a different system or by someone who uses a different system, it might have retained those line endings.\n\n### Fixing the Issue\n\n1. **Convert Line Endings**:\n   - As you've discovered, `dos2unix` is a straightforward way to convert the line endings to Unix style.\n\n2. **Preventing Future Issues**:\n   - In Geany, go to `Edit` > `Preferences` > `Files` and ensure \"Default line endings\" is set to \"Unix\".\n   - Always check the line endings when receiving a file from another source or system.\n\n3. **Shebang Specifics**:\n   - If the file is executable and the shebang is correct, ensure there are no hidden characters. Running `dos2unix` is a quick fix, but understanding and configuring your environment to prevent this is key.\n\nBy understanding and managing line endings across your development environment, you can avoid these kinds of issues in the future."
