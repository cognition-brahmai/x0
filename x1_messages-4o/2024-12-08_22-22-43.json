        "content": "To classify passages as fiction or non-fiction, you can use natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as text classification with machine learning models. Here's a simple example using a pre-trained model from a library like Hugging Face's `transformers`. This example uses a BERT-based model fine-tuned for text classification tasks.\n\nFirst, you'll need to install the necessary libraries:\n\n```bash\npip install transformers torch\n```\n\nNow, you can create a function to classify the passages:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\ndef classify_passages(passages):\n    # Load a pre-trained text classification model\n    classifier = pipeline(\"text-classification\", model=\"distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english\")\n    \n    classification_results = {}\n    for passage in passages:\n        result = classifier(passage)[0]\n        label = result['label']\n        \n        # Simplifying the label to fiction/non-fiction based on sentiment\n        # This is a basic approach and can be fine-tuned with a more specific dataset\n        if label == 'NEGATIVE':\n            classification_results[passage] = 'Fiction'\n        else:\n            classification_results[passage] = 'Non-Fiction'\n    \n    return classification_results\n\n# Example passage\npassages = [\n    \"John ran to the store to buy some eggs, but it was closed.\"\n]\n\n# Classify the passage\nclassification = classify_passages(passages)\n\nfor passage, genre in classification.items():\n    print(f\"Passage: {passage}\\nClassified as: {genre}\\n\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the simplification is based on sentiment analysis, which might not be the most accurate method for determining fiction vs. non-fiction. A more robust approach would involve training a custom model on a dataset specifically labeled for fiction and non-fiction text, but that requires a labeled dataset and more extensive model training.\n\nRegarding the example passage \"John ran to the store to buy some eggs, but it was closed.\", it's likely to be classified as fiction due to its narrative style. However, without a specific model trained on fiction and non-fiction genres, this classification might not be perfectly accurate."
