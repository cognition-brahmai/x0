        "content": "In Python, you can round a number up to the nearest integer using the `math.ceil()` function from the `math` module. This function takes a number as input and returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to that number. Here's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Example number\nnumber = 4.2\n\n# Round up to the nearest integer\nrounded_number = math.ceil(number)\n\nprint(rounded_number)  # Output: 5\n```\n\nIn this example, `math.ceil(4.2)` returns `5`, which is the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to `4.2`."
