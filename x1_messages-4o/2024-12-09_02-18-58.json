I would like to do this without changing the actual file name because that would cause some editors to not recognize it as a Python file. Here's the current setup:\n\n```python\nfrom distutils.core import setup\nsetup(..., scripts=['myscript.py'], ...)\n```\n\nIs there a way to retain the old name 'myscript.py' but install the file as 'myscript'?"

        "content": "To achieve this, you can use the `entry_points` feature provided by `setuptools`, which is a more powerful and flexible alternative to `distutils`. By using `setuptools`, you can specify console scripts that can be installed and executed as standalone commands. Here's how you can modify your setup script to use `setuptools` and create an executable script called `myscript`:\n\n1. First, ensure you have `setuptools` installed. If not, you can install it using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install setuptools\n   ```\n\n2. Modify your `setup.py` script to use `setuptools` instead of `distutils`. Define an `entry_points` parameter to create a console script:\n\n   ```python\n   from setuptools import setup\n\n   setup(\n       ...,\n       entry_points={\n           'console_scripts': [\n               'myscript = myscript:main',  # Replace 'main' with the actual entry function in your script\n           ],\n       },\n       ...\n   )\n   ```\n\nIn this example, `myscript:main` refers to the Python module and function that should be executed when the `myscript` command is run. You should replace `'main'` with the name of the function in your `myscript.py` that you want to execute. The `myscript` command will be available in your environment's `PATH`, allowing it to be run directly from the command line.\n\n3. Ensure your `myscript.py` file has a function defined that can serve as an entry point. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   def main():\n       print(\"Hello, world!\")\n       # Your script logic here\n\n   if __name__ == '__main__':\n       main()\n   ```\n\nBy using `setuptools` and `entry_points`, you can retain the `.py` extension for your script file while installing it as a command without the extension. This allows editors to continue recognizing it as a Python file while providing a clean command-line interface for users."
