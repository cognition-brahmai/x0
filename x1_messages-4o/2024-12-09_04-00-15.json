        "content": "I am a beginner in Python, but have some basic knowledge of C++ and OOP. I understand that Python variables are references to objects, which can be either mutable or immutable. For instance, when we assign `num = 5`, an immutable object `5` is created in memory and the name-object reference pair `num` is created in a namespace. If we then assign `a = num`, both variables refer to the same object and `a` is added to the same namespace. However, I am confused by the following code:\n\n```python\n>>> spam = 42\n>>> cheese = spam\n>>> spam = 100\n>>> spam\n100\n>>> cheese\n42\n```\n\nMy assumption is that since integers are immutable, `spam` is assigned a new reference to a different location in memory in the third line of code. Therefore, the memory that it was initially pointing to wasn't modified, which is why `cheese` refers to the initial object referred to by `spam`. Is this the correct explanation?"

        "content": "Yes, your understanding is correct. Let me break it down for you:\n\n1. **Immutable Objects**: In Python, integers are immutable. This means that once an integer object is created, its value cannot be changed. If you want to \"change\" the value of an integer, you actually create a new integer object with the new value and update the reference.\n\n2. **Assignment and References**: When you perform `spam = 42`, a new integer object `42` is created in memory, and `spam` is a reference to this object.\n\n3. **Copying References**: When you do `cheese = spam`, you are not creating a new object. Instead, you are copying the reference. So both `spam` and `cheese` refer to the same object `42`.\n\n4. **Reassignment**: When you assign `spam = 100`, you're creating a new integer object `100` and changing the reference of `spam` to point to this new object. The original object `42` is still in memory, and `cheese` still refers to it because its reference hasn't changed.\n\nSo, after `spam = 100`, `spam` points to the integer object `100`, while `cheese` continues to point to the integer object `42`.\n\nThis behavior is consistent with how Python handles variable assignments and object references, especially for immutable objects like integers and strings."
