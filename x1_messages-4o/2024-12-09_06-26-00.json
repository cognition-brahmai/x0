For instance, how could I translate the following SQL query into SQLAlchemy?\n\n```sql\nselect * from transaction t \nwhere t.amount > 10 and t.amount < 100;\n```\nI understand that we can build dynamic filters for queries for SQLAlchemy by supplying **kwargs to filter_by, as shown below:\n\n```python\nfilters = {'id': '123456', 'amount': '232'}\ndb.session.query(Transaction).filter_by(**filters)\n```\nBut how can I apply this to \"greater than\" or \"less than\" conditions?"

        "content": "To implement dynamic filters with conditions such as \"greater than\" or \"less than\" using SQLAlchemy, you can use the `filter` method instead of `filter_by`. The `filter` method allows you to use expressions and operators like `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=`. This provides more flexibility compared to `filter_by`, which is limited to equality checks.\n\nHere's how you can translate your SQL query into SQLAlchemy using dynamic filters:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\n\nBase = declarative_base()\n\nclass Transaction(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'transaction'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n    amount = Column(Integer)\n    # Add other fields as necessary\n\n# Assuming you have an engine and session setup\nengine = create_engine('your_database_url')\nSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\nsession = Session()\n\n# Dynamic filter conditions\nlower_bound = 10\nupper_bound = 100\n\n# Building the query with dynamic filters\nquery = session.query(Transaction).filter(\n    Transaction.amount > lower_bound,\n    Transaction.amount < upper_bound\n)\n\n# Execute the query\nresults = query.all()\n\n# Process the results\nfor transaction in results:\n    print(transaction.id, transaction.amount)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Setup and Model Definition**: Ensure you have your SQLAlchemy model defined. In this example, the `Transaction` model is created with an `id` and `amount` column.\n- **Session Initialization**: Create an SQLAlchemy session to interact with the database.\n- **Dynamic Filters**: Use the `filter` method to apply \"greater than\" (`>`) and \"less than\" (`<`) conditions. You can adjust the `lower_bound` and `upper_bound` variables dynamically based on your requirements.\n- **Executing the Query**: Call `.all()` to execute the query and retrieve results.\n\nThis approach allows you to apply complex filtering logic dynamically, beyond simple equality checks. You can also use other SQLAlchemy comparison operators like `>=`, `<=`, `!=`, etc., depending on your specific needs."
