You can use `np.column_stack` to stack the arrays as columns and then save them using `np.savetxt`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport numpy as np\n\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4]\ny = [5, 6, 7, 8]\nz = [9, 10, 11, 12]\n\n# Stack the arrays as columns\ndata = np.column_stack((x, y, z))\n\n# Save to file\nnp.savetxt('myfile.txt', data, fmt='%.18g', delimiter=' ', newline=os.linesep)\n```\n\nThis will save the arrays in the desired columnar format:\n\n```\n1 5 9\n2 6 10\n3 7 11\n4 8 12\n```"
