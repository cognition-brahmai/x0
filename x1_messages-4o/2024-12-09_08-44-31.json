        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to a difference between Python 2 and Python 3. In Python 2, `xrange()` is a built-in function that returns an iterator, while `range()` returns a list. In Python 3, `xrange()` was removed, and `range()` now behaves like `xrange()` did in Python 2, providing an iterator.\n\nSince the error message indicates that `xrange` is not defined, it suggests that the code you are trying to run is written for Python 2 but is being executed in a Python 3 environment.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can modify the code to use `range()` instead of `xrange()`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Open the file where the error is occurring, which, according to the trace, seems to be in `inventory.py` at line 17.\n2. Replace all instances of `xrange()` with `range()`.\n3. Ensure that no other parts of the code rely on Python 2-specific features.\n\nIf you're interested in running the code as it was originally intended (i.e., using Python 2), you could also consider installing Python 2 on your system and running the script with it. However, given that Python 2 has reached its end of life, it's usually better to update the code to work with Python 3.\n\nLastly, if you encounter any other Python 2-specific syntax or functions, you'll need to update them to their Python 3 equivalents."
