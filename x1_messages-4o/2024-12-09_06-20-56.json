My code is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport pymysql\nconn = pymysql.connect(host='localhost', port=3306, user='userid', passwd='password', db='fan')\ncur = conn.cursor()\nprint \"writing to db\"\ncur.execute(\"INSERT INTO cbs_transactions(leagueID) VALUES ('test val')\")\nprint \"wrote to db\"\n```\n\nThe console prints \"writing to db\" and \"wrote to db\", indicating that the script is not terminating until after the execute command. However, when I check the table in MySQL, it is empty and the record did not get inserted. Why is the record not being written to the table and how can I see a log or error to understand what happened? Usually, there should be some kind of error in red if the code fails."

        "content": "From your description and the code provided, it seems like the issue might be related to not committing the transaction after executing the `INSERT` statement. In MySQL, changes made by an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement are not automatically committed unless you specify autocommit mode. To ensure that the changes are saved to the database, you need to call `commit()` on the connection object after executing your SQL statement.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to include the commit:\n\n```python\nimport pymysql\n\n# Establish the connection\nconn = pymysql.connect(host='localhost', port=3306, user='userid', passwd='password', db='fan')\n\n# Create a cursor object\ncur = conn.cursor()\n\nprint(\"writing to db\")\n\n# Execute the INSERT statement\ncur.execute(\"INSERT INTO cbs_transactions(leagueID) VALUES ('test val')\")\n\n# Commit the transaction\nconn.commit()\n\nprint(\"wrote to db\")\n\n# Close the cursor and connection\ncur.close()\nconn.close()\n```\n\nAdditionally, to capture and log any exceptions or errors that might occur during the execution, you can wrap your database operations in a try-except block:\n\n```python\nimport pymysql\n\ntry:\n    # Establish the connection\n    conn = pymysql.connect(host='localhost', port=3306, user='userid', passwd='password', db='fan')\n\n    # Create a cursor object\n    cur = conn.cursor()\n\n    print(\"writing to db\")\n\n    # Execute the INSERT statement\n    cur.execute(\"INSERT INTO cbs_transactions(leagueID) VALUES ('test val')\")\n\n    # Commit the transaction\n    conn.commit()\n\n    print(\"wrote to db\")\n\nexcept pymysql.MySQLError as e:\n    print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n\nfinally:\n    # Close the cursor and connection\n    cur.close()\n    conn.close()\n```\n\nBy using the `commit()` method, your transaction will be finalized and the changes will be reflected in your database. The `try-except` block will help you catch and log any errors that might occur during the process."
