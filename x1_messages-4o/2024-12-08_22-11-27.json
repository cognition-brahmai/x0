        "content": "To calculate the probability of rolling heads 3 times in a row with a fair coin, we need to consider the probability of getting heads on a single coin flip and then use that to find the probability for three consecutive flips.\n\n1. The probability of getting heads on a single flip of a fair coin is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n2. To get heads three times in a row, you multiply the probability of getting heads on each individual flip:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Probability of 3 heads in a row} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{8}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling heads 3 times in a row with a fair coin is \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) or 0.125."
