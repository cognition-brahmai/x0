        "content": "The expected value of a discrete random variable \\( X \\), often denoted as \\( E(X) \\) or \\( \\mu \\), is a fundamental concept in probability theory that provides a measure of the central tendency or the average outcome of a random process.\n\nThe formula to calculate the expected value of a discrete random variable \\( X \\) is:\n\n\\[ E(X) = \\sum_{i} x_i \\cdot P(x_i) \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( x_i \\) represents the possible values that the random variable \\( X \\) can take.\n- \\( P(x_i) \\) is the probability that \\( X \\) takes the value \\( x_i \\).\n- The sum is taken over all possible values of \\( X \\).\n\n### Explanation:\nTo calculate the expected value:\n\n1. **List all possible values** that the random variable \\( X \\) can take. These are typically discrete values like integers.\n\n2. **Determine the probability** of each value. These probabilities must sum to 1.\n\n3. **Multiply each value** of the random variable by its corresponding probability. This step accounts for the contribution of each value to the expected average.\n\n4. **Sum all these products** to obtain the expected value.\n\n### Use in Probability Theory:\n- **Central Tendency**: The expected value gives an average outcome, which helps in understanding the central tendency of a probability distribution.\n- **Decision Making**: In decision theory, the expected value is used to determine the best decision when faced with uncertainty.\n- **Risk Assessment**: It helps in assessing risks by providing a single summary measure of a random variable's distribution.\n- **Other Calculations**: Expected values are also used in variance and standard deviation calculations to measure the spread or dispersion of a distribution.\n\nThis concept is widely used in various fields, including finance, economics, insurance, and any domain where risk and uncertainty are analyzed."
