        "content": "The `boto3` library provides two functions for listing objects in an Amazon S3 bucket: `list_objects()` and `list_objects_v2()`. While they serve a similar purpose, there are some important differences between them:\n\n1. **API Version**:\n   - `list_objects()` is the original version of the API call.\n   - `list_objects_v2()` is the newer version and is recommended for use in current applications.\n\n2. **Continuation Tokens**:\n   - `list_objects()` uses a parameter called `marker` to indicate where to start listing from if the results are truncated. This approach has limitations, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n   - `list_objects_v2()` uses a `ContinuationToken` for pagination, which is more efficient and easier to use. It provides a consistent and reliable way to iterate through large sets of objects.\n\n3. **Max Keys**:\n   - Both functions include a parameter to limit the number of objects returned in a single call (`MaxKeys`), but `list_objects_v2()` has improved handling for this parameter.\n\n4. **Encoding Type**:\n   - Both functions support encoding types, but `list_objects_v2()` provides a more consistent approach to dealing with encoding, especially useful when dealing with special characters in object keys.\n\n5. **Response Structure**:\n   - The response structure from `list_objects_v2()` is slightly different and may offer additional information or a more streamlined format.\n\n**Benefits of Using `list_objects_v2()`**:\n- **Enhanced Pagination**: The use of `ContinuationToken` over `marker` makes it easier to handle large datasets and ensures that pagination is more reliable.\n- **Improved Consistency**: The newer API aligns with other AWS services' pagination methods, offering a more consistent experience across different AWS services.\n- **Future-Proof**: As the newer version, `list_objects_v2()` is more likely to receive updates and support from AWS moving forward.\n\nIn summary, while both functions can be used to list objects in an S3 bucket, `list_objects_v2()` is generally preferred due to its improved features and better handling of pagination. If you're starting a new project or updating an existing one, it's advisable to use `list_objects_v2()`."
