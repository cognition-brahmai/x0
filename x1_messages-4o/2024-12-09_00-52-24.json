        "content": "When you use `%matplotlib notebook`, it enables interactive features for your plots, requiring a live connection between the Jupyter Notebook and the backend that's rendering the plot. If you're seeing a blank plot, it could be due to a few reasons:\n\n1. **Backend Compatibility**: The `%matplotlib notebook` magic command uses an interactive backend that may not be fully compatible with your current setup. Ensure that your Jupyter Notebook server and client are properly configured to support interactive backends.\n\n2. **Plot not Displaying**: In interactive mode, sometimes the plot may not display because it requires an explicit call to `plt.show()` to render the figure. Make sure you include `plt.show()` at the end of your plotting commands to ensure the plot is displayed.\n\n3. **Version Conflicts**: Check if there are any version conflicts between `matplotlib`, `ipympl`, `notebook`, or `jupyter` packages. Updating them to the latest versions might solve the issue. You can update them using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade matplotlib ipympl notebook jupyter\n   ```\n\n4. **Browser Issues**: Sometimes, the issue could be browser-related. Try clearing your browser cache or using a different browser to see if the issue persists.\n\n5. **Jupyter Lab vs Notebook**: If you're using Jupyter Lab, make sure that you have the `jupyter-matplotlib` extension installed, as `%matplotlib notebook` might not work out of the box in Jupyter Lab without this extension.\n\n   ```bash\n   jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager\n   jupyter labextension install jupyter-matplotlib\n   ```\n\n6. **Output Cell Issues**: Occasionally, the output cell in Jupyter Notebook might not display properly. Try restarting the kernel and rerunning the notebook to see if the plot appears.\n\nIf none of these solutions work, consider sticking with `%matplotlib inline` for non-interactive plots or exploring alternative interactive plotting libraries like `plotly` or `bokeh` which might offer better compatibility with your environment."
