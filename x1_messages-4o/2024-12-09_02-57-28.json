        "content": "To extract the full IP address from the HTML string, you'll need to modify your regular expression to ensure it captures the entire IP address pattern. Your current regex captures only the first number because it uses capturing parentheses around `([0-9]+)` which only captures the first part of the IP address. Here's how you can modify your regular expression to capture the entire IP address:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ns = \"<html><head><title>Current IP Check</title></head><body>Current IP Address: 165.91.15.131</body></html>\"\n\n# Modify the regular expression to capture the full IP address\nip = re.findall(r'(\\d{1,3}(?:\\.\\d{1,3}){3})', s)\n\nprint(ip)\n```\n\nExplanation of the regular expression:\n- `\\d{1,3}`: Matches 1 to 3 digits, which represents each octet of the IP address.\n- `(?:\\.\\d{1,3}){3}`: Matches the pattern of a dot followed by 1 to 3 digits three times, accounting for the remaining three octets of the IP address.\n- `()` around the whole pattern ensures that the entire IP address is captured as a single match.\n\nThis revised regex should correctly extract the entire IP address `165.91.15.131` from the given HTML string."
