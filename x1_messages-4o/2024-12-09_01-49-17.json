Here is a simple way to do it:\n\n```python\n# Define the original string\noriginal_string = \"aaaabbbb\"\n\n# Extract the last four characters\nlast_four_chars = original_string[-4:]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(last_four_chars)\n```\n\nIn this example, `original_string[-4:]` uses slicing to get the last four characters of the string. The `-4` index means \"start from the fourth character from the end\" and the `:` means \"go to the end of the string\". This will store the substring \"bbbb\" in `last_four_chars`."
