After the copying process, I want 'os.readlink' to return the same for both 'src' and 'dst'. I have tried using various functions in the 'shutil' module like 'copyfile', 'copy' and 'copy2' but they all copy the contents of the file and do not preserve the link. The 'shutil.move' function has the correct behavior but it removes the original file. Is there a built-in way in Python to perform a file copy while preserving symbolic links?"

        "content": "To copy a file while preserving symbolic links in Python, you can use the `os` module to check if the source file is a symbolic link and then use `os.symlink` to create a symbolic link at the destination. Here's a step-by-step guide to accomplish this:\n\n1. Check if the source is a symbolic link using `os.path.islink`.\n2. If it is a symbolic link, use `os.readlink` to get the path it points to.\n3. Use `os.symlink` to create a new symbolic link at the destination pointing to the same target.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport shutil\n\ndef copy_with_symlink(src, dst):\n    # Check if the source is a symbolic link\n    if os.path.islink(src):\n        # Get the target of the symlink\n        target = os.readlink(src)\n        # Create a new symlink at the destination pointing to the same target\n        os.symlink(target, dst)\n    else:\n        # If not a symlink, use shutil to copy the file normally\n        shutil.copy2(src, dst)\n\n# Example usage\nsrc = 'path/to/src'\ndst = 'path/to/dst'\ncopy_with_symlink(src, dst)\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the source file is a symbolic link. If it is, it reads the target of the link and creates a new symbolic link at the destination pointing to the same target. If the source is not a symbolic link, it defaults to using `shutil.copy2` to copy the file normally. This way, you preserve the symbolic link when copying."
