However, when I check my Python Output pane, I get the following error:\n\n```plaintext\nFormatting with black failed.\nError: Error: no such option: --line-length 80\n```\n\nWhen I modify my settings.json to have no arguments, like this:\n\n```JSON\n\"python.formatting.blackArgs\": [],\n```\n\nblack works as expected. Can anyone guide me on how to correctly pass arguments to the black formatter, which was new as of June 2018?"

        "content": "It seems like you're encountering an issue with passing the `--line-length` argument to Black in your VS Code settings. This could be due to a couple of reasons related to the version of Black you have installed or how the arguments are being interpreted. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify Black Version**: \n   Make sure you have the latest version of Black installed. You can check the version and update it using the following commands in your Anaconda prompt or terminal:\n   ```bash\n   black --version\n   conda update black -c conda-forge\n   ```\n\n2. **Check Argument Syntax**:\n   The error message suggests that the syntax for passing the argument might be incorrect. Ensure that the argument is correctly formatted in your `settings.json`. It should be:\n   ```JSON\n   \"python.formatting.blackArgs\": [\n       \"--line-length\",\n       \"80\"\n   ],\n   ```\n\n   Note that `--line-length` and `80` should be separate elements in the array.\n\n3. **Ensure `python.formatting.provider` is Set to Black**:\n   Ensure that Black is set as the formatter in your VS Code settings:\n   ```JSON\n   \"python.formatting.provider\": \"black\",\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for Issues with VS Code or Python Extension**:\n   Sometimes, issues can arise from the VS Code or the Python extension itself. Ensure that both are updated to the latest version:\n   - Update VS Code to the latest version.\n   - Update the Python extension in VS Code.\n\n5. **Try Using a `.black` Configuration File**:\n   Another approach is to use a configuration file for Black. You can create a `pyproject.toml` file in the root of your project with the following content:\n   ```toml\n   [tool.black]\n   line-length = 80\n   ```\n\n   This way, Black will automatically pick up the configuration when you run it.\n\n6. **Check Environment**:\n   Make sure that the environment you are running in VS Code is the same environment where Black is installed. You can do this by checking the bottom left corner of VS Code to see the selected Python interpreter.\n\n7. **Restart VS Code**:\n   After making changes, sometimes a restart of VS Code is necessary for the changes to take effect.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to pass the `--line-length` argument to Black successfully. If you still encounter issues, consider checking the official Black documentation or community forums for any updates or known issues with your specific setup."
