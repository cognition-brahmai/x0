Here is a simple C# program that does this:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        int n = 12;\n        int sum = n * (n + 1) / 2;\n        \n        Console.WriteLine(\"The sum of the first 12 natural numbers is: \" + sum);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We declare an integer `n` and set it to 12, which represents the first 12 natural numbers.\n- We use the formula \\( \\text{sum} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\) to calculate the sum.\n- Finally, we print the result to the console.\n\nYou can run this program in any C# environment to see the output."
