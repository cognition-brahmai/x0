However, I am encountering an issue where Eclipse is indicating that User.DoesNotExist is undefined. I suspect I'm missing something trivial. Here is the relevant portion of my code:\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User\n...\nclass SignUpForm (forms.Form):\n    ...\n    def clean_username (self): \n        try:\n            User.objects.get(username=self.cleaned_data['username'])\n        except User.DoesNotExist:\n            return self.cleaned_data['username']\n        raise forms.ValidationError(USERNAME_ALREADY_IN_USE)\n    ...\n```\n\nCan anyone advise me on how to resolve this issue?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to the way Django handles exceptions when querying the database. In Django, when you try to retrieve an object from the database using `get()`, it raises a `User.DoesNotExist` exception if no matching object is found. However, in modern Django versions, this exception is not directly tied to the `User` class but is instead a general exception for the model.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you should catch the `User.DoesNotExist` exception correctly. Here\u2019s how you can do that:\n\n1. Instead of catching `User.DoesNotExist`, you should catch `User.DoesNotExist` as `User` is a model, and `DoesNotExist` is an attribute of the model's manager.\n\n2. Alternatively, in more recent Django versions, it is possible to use `User.DoesNotExist` directly, but if you encounter issues, you can also use `User.DoesNotExist` as a fallback.\n\nHere is how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User\nfrom django import forms\n\nUSERNAME_ALREADY_IN_USE = \"This username is already in use.\"\n\nclass SignUpForm(forms.Form):\n    username = forms.CharField(max_length=150)  # Assuming you have a username field\n\n    def clean_username(self): \n        username = self.cleaned_data['username']\n        try:\n            User.objects.get(username=username)\n        except User.DoesNotExist:  # This should work in recent Django versions\n            return username\n        raise forms.ValidationError(USERNAME_ALREADY_IN_USE)\n```\n\nAdditionally, ensure that you have imported `forms` from `django` at the top of your file if you are using it for form validation. This will ensure that `forms.ValidationError` is recognized.\n\nBy catching the exception correctly, you should eliminate the error message indicating that `User.DoesNotExist` is undefined. If you continue to experience issues, double-check that your Django environment and imports are correctly set up."
