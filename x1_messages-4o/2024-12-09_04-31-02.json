DeepLab_v2 compiles fine on another computer that has Cuda 7.5, but since my current computer has a Pascal Titan X, I need to use Cuda 8.0. How can I solve this issue?"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering is related to a conflict in definitions for the `atomicAdd` function when using CUDA 8.0. This issue arises because CUDA 8.0 introduced native support for `atomicAdd` for `double` types, whereas earlier versions required a custom implementation. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check for Custom Implementations:**\n   - Search the DeepLab_v2 source code and any included files for a custom implementation of `atomicAdd` for `double`. It might look something like this:\n     ```cpp\n     __device__ double atomicAdd(double* address, double val) {\n         // Custom implementation\n     }\n     ```\n   - If you find such a function, it should be conditionally compiled only if CUDA version is less than 8.0. You can do this by using preprocessor directives.\n\n2. **Modify the Code with Preprocessor Directives:**\n   - Wrap the custom `atomicAdd` function with preprocessor checks to ensure it's only compiled for versions prior to CUDA 8.0:\n     ```cpp\n     #if !defined(__CUDA_ARCH__) || __CUDA_ARCH__ >= 600\n     #else\n     __device__ double atomicAdd(double* address, double val) {\n         // Custom implementation for older architectures\n     }\n     #endif\n     ```\n   - Alternatively, you can use:\n     ```cpp\n     #if CUDA_VERSION < 8000\n     __device__ double atomicAdd(double* address, double val) {\n         // Custom implementation\n     }\n     #endif\n     ```\n\n3. **Recompile DeepLab_v2:**\n   - After making these changes, clean your build environment to remove any previously compiled objects:\n     ```bash\n     make clean\n     ```\n   - Then, recompile DeepLab_v2:\n     ```bash\n     make -j8\n     ```\n\n4. **Verify Compatibility:**\n   - Ensure that your NVCC compiler is compatible with CUDA 8.0 and that you have the correct paths set in your `Makefile.config` or equivalent configuration file.\n\n5. **Consider Upgrading Your Environment:**\n   - Since Ubuntu 14.04 is quite outdated, consider upgrading your system to a more recent LTS version like Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04, which will have better support for newer CUDA versions.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the compilation error and successfully build DeepLab_v2 with CUDA 8.0 on your system."
