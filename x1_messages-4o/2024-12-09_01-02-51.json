Interestingly, the celery worker reports the task as succeeding:\n\n```\n[2014-04-22 19:12:03,608: INFO/MainProcess] Task test_celery.add[168c7d96-e41a-41c9-80f5-50b24dcaff73] succeeded in 0.000435483998444s: 19 \n```\n\nWhy am I receiving this AttributeError and how can I resolve it?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, `AttributeError: 'DisabledBackend' object has no attribute '_get_task_meta_for'`, typically arises when Celery's result backend has not been configured. In your setup, it seems that the result backend is not set, which is why you're seeing this error despite the task executing successfully.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to configure a result backend for Celery. The result backend stores the state and result of a task, which allows you to retrieve the outcome after the task execution. Here's how you can configure a result backend:\n\n1. **Update your Celery configuration** to include a result backend. You can use a database, a cache (like Redis), or any other supported backend. Here, I'll show you how to use Redis as an example:\n\n```python\nfrom celery import Celery\n\napp = Celery('tasks', broker='amqp://guest@localhost//', backend='redis://localhost:6379/0')\n\n@app.task\ndef add(x, y):\n    return x + y\n```\n\n2. **Install Redis** and its Python client if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\npip install redis\n```\n\n3. **Run a Redis server** on your machine. You can do this by installing Redis and starting the Redis service.\n\n4. **Re-run your Celery worker** and tasks:\n\n```bash\ncelery -A tasks worker --loglevel=info\n```\n\n5. **Call your task again and check the result**:\n\n```python\n>>> from tasks import add\n>>> result = add.delay(4, 4)\n>>> result.get(timeout=1)  # This should retrieve the result from the backend\n```\n\nBy setting up a result backend, you should no longer encounter the `DisabledBackend` error, and you will be able to track and retrieve your task results successfully."
