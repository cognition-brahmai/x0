Additionally, the program should be able to handle complex sentences with multiple clauses and provide a detailed breakdown of the sentiment analysis for each clause."

        "content": "To achieve the tasks you've outlined, we will use Python along with the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library for sentiment analysis. We'll need to break down the tasks into manageable parts:\n\n1. **Sentiment Analysis** using NLTK's VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner).\n2. **Sentence Transformation** by replacing negative words with positive words.\n3. **Comparison Table** for different sentiment analysis models (we will consider NLTK's VADER and TextBlob for this example).\n4. **Clause Breakdown** for detailed sentiment analysis.\n\nHere\u2019s a Python program that accomplishes these tasks:\n\n```python\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer\nfrom textblob import TextBlob\nfrom tabulate import tabulate\n\n# Ensure the necessary NLTK data is downloaded\nnltk.download('vader_lexicon')\n\ndef analyze_sentiment(sentence):\n    # Initialize VADER sentiment analyzer\n    sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()\n\n    # Analyze the sentiment of the entire sentence\n    sentiment_scores = sia.polarity_scores(sentence)\n    sentiment_score = sentiment_scores['compound']\n\n    # Break down the sentence into clauses using simple punctuation-based splitting\n    clauses = sentence.split(' and ')\n    clause_sentiments = [(clause, sia.polarity_scores(clause)['compound']) for clause in clauses]\n\n    # Transform the negative sentence to a more positive one\n    positive_sentence = sentence.replace(\"bad\", \"good\").replace(\"terrible\", \"great\")\n\n    # Sentiment analysis using TextBlob\n    textblob_sentiment = TextBlob(sentence).sentiment.polarity\n\n    # Prepare a comparison table\n    table = [\n        [\"Model\", \"Sentiment Score\"],\n        [\"NLTK VADER\", sentiment_score],\n        [\"TextBlob\", textblob_sentiment]\n    ]\n\n    # Output the results\n    print(\"Original Sentence:\", sentence)\n    print(\"Overall Sentiment Score (VADER):\", sentiment_score)\n    print(\"Positive Sentence Version:\", positive_sentence)\n    print(\"\\nClause-wise Sentiment Breakdown:\")\n    for clause, score in clause_sentiments:\n        print(f\"'{clause.strip()}': Sentiment Score = {score}\")\n    print(\"\\nSentiment Analysis Comparison:\")\n    print(tabulate(table, headers='firstrow', tablefmt='fancy_grid'))\n\n# Example sentence\nsentence = \"The news was really bad and it made me feel terrible.\"\nanalyze_sentiment(sentence)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n\n1. **Sentiment Analysis**:\n   - We use NLTK's `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer` to get the sentiment score of the sentence and each clause.\n   - The compound score is used as it provides an overall sentiment score between -1 (very negative) and 1 (very positive).\n\n2. **Sentence Transformation**:\n   - We perform a simple replacement of negative words with positive ones. This can be enhanced by using a more sophisticated mapping or a thesaurus.\n\n3. **Comparison Table**:\n   - We compare the sentiment scores from NLTK's VADER and TextBlob.\n   - TextBlob provides a polarity score ranging from -1 to 1, similar to VADER.\n\n4. **Clause Breakdown**:\n   - The sentence is split into clauses based on the conjunction 'and'. This is a basic approach and can be improved for more complex sentences.\n\nThis program gives a comprehensive view of the sentiment of the input sentence, transforms it into a positive version, and compares different sentiment models, providing detailed insights."
