However, there is a constraint in place that the discounted price should not be less than $150. Can you determine the minimum percentage discount that is required to meet this constraint and purchase the item for at least $150? Assuming an additional discount of x%, the final price after the discount can be represented as (0.8*(1-x/100))*200. Can you compute the value of x that meets the constraint?"
