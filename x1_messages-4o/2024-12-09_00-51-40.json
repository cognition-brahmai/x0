        "content": "I am attempting to read a True or False value from a file and convert it to a boolean in Python. However, my current approach always converts the value to True, even when the value in the file is False. Here is a minimal working example of my current approach:\n\n```python\nwith open('file.dat', mode=\"r\") as f:\n    for line in f:\n        reader = line.split()\n        # Convert to boolean <-- Not working?\n        flag = bool(reader[0])\n\nif flag:\n    print 'flag == True'\nelse:\n    print 'flag == False'\n```\n\nThe file.dat file simply contains a single string which is either \"True\" or \"False\". This code is a simplified example from a larger project in which I read parameters in the same way. Why is the variable 'flag' always being converted to True?"

        "content": "The issue arises from the way you are converting the string to a boolean. In Python, the `bool()` function will convert any non-empty string to `True`. Therefore, when you use `bool(reader[0])`, it always results in `True` because `reader[0]` is a non-empty string (\"True\" or \"False\").\n\nTo correctly convert the string \"True\" or \"False\" to a boolean, you need to explicitly compare the string value. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nwith open('file.dat', mode=\"r\") as f:\n    for line in f:\n        reader = line.split()\n        # Convert to boolean correctly by comparing the string\n        flag = reader[0] == \"True\"\n\nif flag:\n    print('flag == True')\nelse:\n    print('flag == False')\n```\n\nIn this revised code, `reader[0] == \"True\"` will evaluate to `True` if `reader[0]` is the string \"True\", and `False` otherwise. This way, the `flag` variable will accurately reflect the boolean value you intend based on the string content in your file."
