I've installed Python 3.4 on my Mac using `brew install python3`. How can I create a virtual environment that uses this new version of Python? When I try using `virtualenv -p python3 test`, I get an error. The error message is:\n\n```\nRunning virtualenv with interpreter /usr/local/bin/python3\nUsing base prefix '/usr/local/Cellar/python3/3.4.0_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4'\nNew python executable in test/bin/python3.4\nAlso creating executable in test/bin/python\nFailed to import the site module\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Users/user/Documents/workspace/test/test/bin/../lib/python3.4/site.py\", line 67, in &lt;module&gt;\n    import os\n  File \"/Users/user/Documents/workspace/test/test/bin/../lib/python3.4/os.py\", line 634, in &lt;module&gt;\n    from _collections_abc import MutableMapping\nImportError: No module named '_collections_abc'\nERROR: The executable test/bin/python3.4 is not functioning\nERROR: It thinks sys.prefix is '/Users/user/Documents/workspace/test' (should be '/Users/user/Documents/workspace/test/test')\nERROR: virtualenv is not compatible with this system or executable\n```\n\nHow can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to a compatibility problem between `virtualenv` and the version of Python 3.4 you installed via Homebrew. Here are a few steps to resolve this:\n\n1. **Update virtualenv**: First, ensure that you have the latest version of `virtualenv`, as older versions might have compatibility issues with newer Python installations. You can update it using:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade virtualenv\n   ```\n\n2. **Use `venv` instead of `virtualenv`**: Python 3.3 and later come with a built-in module called `venv`, which can be used to create virtual environments. This might work better with your Python 3.4 installation. Use the following command to create a virtual environment:\n   ```bash\n   python3.4 -m venv test\n   ```\n\n3. **Check Python Path**: Make sure that the path to `python3` is correctly set up in your environment. You can verify the path using:\n   ```bash\n   which python3.4\n   ```\n\n4. **Ensure Homebrew Environment is Correct**: Sometimes, Homebrew might not link the Python version properly. You can try:\n   ```bash\n   brew unlink python3 && brew link python3\n   ```\n\n5. **Reinstall Python 3.4**: If the above steps don't work, consider reinstalling Python 3.4 using Homebrew. Sometimes a fresh installation fixes underlying issues:\n   ```bash\n   brew uninstall python3\n   brew install python3\n   ```\n\n6. **Alternative with pyenv**: If you continue having issues, consider using `pyenv`, a tool to manage multiple Python versions. Install `pyenv` and then:\n   ```bash\n   brew install pyenv\n   pyenv install 3.4.0\n   pyenv virtualenv 3.4.0 test\n   ```\n\nAfter setting up the virtual environment, activate it using:\n```bash\nsource test/bin/activate\n```\n\nThese steps should help you create a functioning virtual environment using Python 3.4."
