        "content": "In CUDA programming, the execution of kernels and the concurrency of grids depend on several factors, including the GPU architecture, the compute capability, and how the code is structured.\n\n1. **CUDA Grids and Concurrent Execution:**\n   - A grid in CUDA is a collection of blocks that execute a kernel. The number of grids that can be supported concurrently on a GPU depends on the GPU's architecture and available resources.\n   - CUDA-capable GPUs can execute multiple kernels concurrently if they support it. This feature is known as concurrent kernel execution, and it typically requires a GPU with a compute capability of 3.5 or higher.\n\n2. **Concurrent Execution of Kernels:**\n   - For the two instances of `Kernel1` in your code to run concurrently, the following conditions should be met:\n     - The GPU must support concurrent kernel execution (compute capability 3.5 or higher).\n     - There must be sufficient resources (such as registers, shared memory, etc.) available to accommodate the simultaneous execution of both kernels.\n     - The CUDA stream in which the kernels are launched must allow concurrency. By default, kernels launched in the same stream execute sequentially. To run them concurrently, you should launch them in different streams.\n\n3. **Code Execution:**\n   - In your code snippet, if both kernel launches are in the default stream (i.e., no specific stream is specified), they will execute sequentially.\n   - To enable concurrent execution, you would need to launch each kernel in its own stream, like this:\n\n     ```cpp\n     cudaStream_t stream1, stream2;\n     cudaStreamCreate(&stream1);\n     cudaStreamCreate(&stream2);\n\n     Kernel1<<<gridDim, blockDim, 0, stream1>>>(dst1, param1);\n     Kernel1<<<gridDim, blockDim, 0, stream2>>>(dst2, param2);\n\n     cudaStreamDestroy(stream1);\n     cudaStreamDestroy(stream2);\n     ```\n\nBy launching the kernels in separate streams, the GPU is allowed to execute them concurrently, provided the hardware supports it and resources are available."
