Here are two examples:\n1. Poison dart frog: The poison dart frog is known for its bright colors, such as bright red, orange, and blue, which serve as a warning to potential predators that it is toxic. The poison in the frog's skin can cause paralysis or death, making it a deadly meal for any predator.\n2. Monarch butterfly: The Monarch butterfly has bright orange and black wings, which serve as a warning to predators that it is toxic. The butterfly feeds on milkweed, which contains toxic chemicals that the butterfly stores in its body. Any predator that tries to eat the butterfly will get sick and learn to avoid it in the future."
