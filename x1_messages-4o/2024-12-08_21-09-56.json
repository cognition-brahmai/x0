However, as soon as his fingers touched it, an elderly man approached him, out of breath and clearly distressed. The man explained that the diamond was an heirloom that had accidentally fallen from his pocket, and he had been frantically searching for it. \n\nJohn, being honest and kind-hearted, decided to return the diamond to the man. Grateful for John's honesty, the elderly man offered him a reward, which John humbly declined. Instead, the man insisted on telling John's parents about his good deed. \n\nLater, John's parents praised him for his integrity, and the elderly man, who turned out to be a jeweler, offered John a weekend job at his store, where John learned a great deal about gems and jewelry. This experience sparked a lifelong passion for gemology in John, leading him to pursue studies and eventually become a renowned gemologist."
