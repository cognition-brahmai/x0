However, when I try to import 'get_column_letter' from 'openpyxl.cell', I encounter an error. The code I'm trying to run is as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom openpyxl.cell import get_column_letter \n```\n\nBut this raises an ImportError: \n\n```python\nImportError: cannot import name get_column_letter\n```\n\nI've tried searching for a solution to this issue but haven't found anything directly related. Can you provide any guidance on how to resolve this error?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is likely due to changes in the structure of the `openpyxl` library in different versions. In some versions of `openpyxl`, the location of the `get_column_letter` function has changed. In newer versions, it is typically found in the `openpyxl.utils` module, not `openpyxl.cell`.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can try importing `get_column_letter` from `openpyxl.utils`. Here\u2019s how you can modify your import statement:\n\n```python\nfrom openpyxl.utils import get_column_letter\n```\n\nIf this doesn't resolve the issue, it could be related to the specific version of `openpyxl` installed. You might want to check the documentation for the version you're using or consider upgrading to a more recent version that has this function located in `openpyxl.utils`.\n\nTo upgrade `openpyxl`, you can use `pip`, which is generally recommended over `easy_install`. Here\u2019s how you can upgrade:\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade openpyxl\n```\n\nMake sure `pip` is linked to Python 2.7 if you're using a virtual environment or have multiple Python versions installed.\n\nAfter upgrading, try running your script again with the updated import statement."
