Then, use the <em> tag to emphasize the verb \"called\", and wrap it in the <code> tag to show it as code. Finally, use the <abbr> tag with the title attribute \"Passive Voice\" to indicate that the sentence has been rewritten in passive voice.\nHere's an example HTML code:\n<p><span style=\"text-transform: capitalize;\">bob </span><em><code>was called</code></em> <span style=\"text-transform: lowercase;\">by </span>the police.</p>\nThis code will display the rewritten sentence \"Bob was called by the police\" in a web page."
