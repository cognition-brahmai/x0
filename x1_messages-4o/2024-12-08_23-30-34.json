        "content": "Natural Language Generation (NLG) is a subfield of artificial intelligence and computational linguistics that focuses on the automatic production of human-like text from structured data. The primary goal of NLG is to enable computers to communicate effectively with humans in natural language. Here are the key aspects of the NLG task:\n\n1. **Data Input**: NLG systems start with structured data, which can be numerical data, databases, or other forms of structured information. This data serves as the foundation for generating text.\n\n2. **Content Determination**: The system decides which pieces of information from the input data are relevant and should be included in the text. This involves understanding the context and purpose of the communication.\n\n3. **Text Structure Planning**: Once the content is determined, the NLG system organizes it into a coherent structure. This involves deciding the order in which information is presented and how it is grouped into sentences and paragraphs.\n\n4. **Sentence Aggregation**: Multiple pieces of information might be combined into a single sentence to ensure the text is concise and readable. This involves grammatical and syntactical considerations.\n\n5. **Lexicalization**: This step involves choosing the appropriate words and phrases to express the information. It requires the system to have a vocabulary and an understanding of synonyms, antonyms, and contextually appropriate language.\n\n6. **Referring Expression Generation**: This involves generating appropriate references to entities, such as pronouns or specific names, ensuring clarity and coherence in the text.\n\n7. **Linguistic Realization**: The system converts the planned text structure into grammatically correct sentences. This involves applying grammatical rules and ensuring agreement in terms of tense, number, gender, etc.\n\n8. **Surface Realization**: Finally, the text is polished to improve readability and fluency. This may involve stylistic adjustments, such as varying sentence length and complexity, to match the intended tone and style.\n\nNLG is used in a wide range of applications, including automated report generation, personalized content creation, chatbots, and virtual assistants, where the ability to produce natural, human-like text enhances user interaction and experience."
