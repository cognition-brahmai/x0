I suspect some of them are not in use, but I'm unsure how to safely identify and remove them. Is there an extension or a method in Visual Studio Code that can help me remove these unused imports? The imports in my code look like this:\n\n```python\nfrom django.core.mail import EmailMultiAlternatives, send_mail\nfrom django.template.loader import render_to_string\nfrom django.utils.html import strip_tags\nfrom rest_framework import routers, serializers, viewsets, status\nfrom rest_framework.views import APIView\nfrom rest_framework.response import Response\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User\n```"

        "content": "In Visual Studio Code, there are a few methods and extensions that can help you identify and remove unused imports in your Python project:\n\n1. **Pylance Extension**: \n   - The Pylance extension is a fast and feature-rich language server for Python in Visual Studio Code. It provides type checking, autocompletion, and more. It can also help you identify unused imports. Once installed, it will underline unused imports and suggest removing them.\n\n2. **Python Extension**:\n   - The official Python extension for Visual Studio Code also provides linting capabilities. Make sure you have it installed and configured properly. It supports several linters, such as pylint, flake8, and mypy, which can help identify unused imports.\n\n3. **PyLint**:\n   - PyLint is a static code analysis tool for Python that can identify unused imports. You can run PyLint from the command line or configure it within Visual Studio Code. To check for unused imports, you can use:\n     ```bash\n     pylint your_script.py\n     ```\n   - PyLint will generate a report, and unused imports will be marked with a `W0611` warning.\n\n4. **isort**:\n   - `isort` is a Python utility that helps sort and manage your imports. While its primary function is sorting, it can also help identify and remove unused imports when used with the `--remove-unused` flag:\n     ```bash\n     isort your_script.py --remove-unused\n     ```\n\n5. **Refactoring Tools**:\n   - Visual Studio Code has built-in refactoring tools that allow you to organize imports. You can trigger the \"Organize Imports\" command by right-clicking in the editor and selecting it from the context menu or by using the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and searching for \"Python: Sort Imports\".\n\n6. **Flake8 with the `flake8-unused-imports` Plugin**:\n   - You can extend Flake8 with the `flake8-unused-imports` plugin to specifically target unused imports. Install it via pip:\n     ```bash\n     pip install flake8 flake8-unused-imports\n     ```\n   - Then run Flake8 to check your code:\n     ```bash\n     flake8 your_script.py\n     ```\n\nBy using these tools and extensions, you can safely identify and remove unused imports, streamlining your code for better readability and performance. Make sure to review any suggestions before applying changes to ensure that no necessary imports are removed accidentally."
