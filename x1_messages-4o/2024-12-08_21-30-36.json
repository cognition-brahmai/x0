The prompt should include a randomly generated idiomatic expression with a missing word for the user to fill in. The following is an example of the output that the code should generate:\n\"The ___ is going up\" (idiomatic expression: \"the stakes are\")\nWhat code can you write to achieve this task?"

        "content": "To generate a random sentence with a missing word for a language learning app that focuses on idiomatic expressions, you can create a Python script that randomly selects an idiomatic expression from a predefined list. Then, replace a chosen word with a blank for the user to fill in. Here's a sample code to achieve this task:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef generate_idiomatic_expression():\n    # List of idiomatic expressions with the key word to be removed\n    idiomatic_expressions = [\n        \"The ball is in your ___ court\",\n        \"A ___ in the hand is worth two in the bush\",\n        \"Bite the ___ bullet\",\n        \"Break the ___ ice\",\n        \"Hit the ___ sack\",\n        \"Let the ___ cat out of the bag\",\n        \"Once in a ___ blue moon\",\n        \"Spill the ___ beans\",\n        \"Under the ___ weather\",\n        \"When pigs ___ fly\"\n    ]\n    \n    # Randomly select an idiomatic expression\n    selected_expression = random.choice(idiomatic_expressions)\n    \n    # Find the position of the blank\n    blank_position = selected_expression.find(\"___\")\n    \n    # Extract the idiom part for hint\n    idiom_hint = selected_expression.replace(\"___\", \"\").strip()\n    \n    return selected_expression, idiom_hint\n\n# Generate an idiomatic expression with a missing word\nexpression, hint = generate_idiomatic_expression()\n\n# Display the result\nprint(f\"Fill in the blank: \\\"{expression}\\\" (idiomatic expression: \\\"{hint}\\\")\")\n```\n\nThis script defines a list of idiomatic expressions with a placeholder (`\"___\"`) for the missing word. It randomly selects one expression, identifies the missing part, and provides the prompt with the idiomatic expression hint. You can expand the list of idiomatic expressions to make the app more diverse and engaging."
