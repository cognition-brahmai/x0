I frequently use the following code:\n\n```python\nclass Person(object):\n    def greet(self):\n        print \"Hello\"\n\nclass Waiter(Person):\n    def greet(self):\n        Person.greet(self)\n        print \"Would you like fries with that?\"\n```\nHowever, I realize the line `Person.greet(self)` might not be ideal as if I change the class Waiter inherits from, I would have to change every occurrence of this line. I generally use single inheritance, but if accommodating multiple inheritance requires extra steps, I'd like to know about that too."

        "content": "To extend a parent class method in a way that is both modern and compatible with both Python 2.x and 3.x, you should use the `super()` function. This approach is cleaner and more maintainable because it allows you to call the parent class method without explicitly naming the parent class. This is particularly useful in scenarios involving multiple inheritance.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code using `super()`:\n\n```python\nclass Person(object):\n    def greet(self):\n        print(\"Hello\")\n\nclass Waiter(Person):\n    def greet(self):\n        super(Waiter, self).greet()\n        print(\"Would you like fries with that?\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Using `super()`**: The `super()` function allows you to call the method of the parent class without explicitly naming it. This makes your code more flexible and easier to maintain. If you ever change the parent class, you won't need to modify the method calls inside your subclass.\n\n- **Syntax Differences Between Python 2 and 3**:\n  - In Python 2.x, you use `super(ChildClassName, self).method()`.\n  - In Python 3.x, you can simply use `super().method()`, eliminating the need to pass the class and instance.\n\n### Handling Multiple Inheritance:\n\nWhen dealing with multiple inheritance, `super()` becomes even more advantageous because it respects the method resolution order (MRO) and ensures that all parent classes are initialized in the correct order.\n\nHere's a simple example illustrating multiple inheritance:\n\n```python\nclass Person(object):\n    def greet(self):\n        print(\"Hello\")\n\nclass Chef(object):\n    def cook(self):\n        print(\"Cooking\")\n\nclass Waiter(Person, Chef):\n    def greet(self):\n        super(Waiter, self).greet()  # Calls Person's greet\n        print(\"Would you like fries with that?\")\n    def serve(self):\n        super(Waiter, self).cook()  # Calls Chef's cook\n        print(\"Serving the dish\")\n\n# Usage\nwaiter = Waiter()\nwaiter.greet()  # Outputs: Hello\\nWould you like fries with that?\nwaiter.serve()  # Outputs: Cooking\\nServing the dish\n```\n\nIn this example, `super()` ensures that the correct methods are called according to the method resolution order, making the code robust and easy to extend."
