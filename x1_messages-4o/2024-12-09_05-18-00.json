I have selected some columns using `pandas` and filled in `NaN` values with 0. I have also marked the categorical columns with the 'category' data type and used `get_dummies()` from `pandas`. After training and testing my dataset, when I call the `score` method I receive a score of around 0.867. However, when I call the `roc_auc_score` method I get a significantly lower score of around 0.583. Here's my code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\ndf = df[[\"MONTH\", \"DAY_OF_MONTH\", \"DAY_OF_WEEK\", \"ORIGIN\", \"DEST\", \"CRS_DEP_TIME\", \"ARR_DEL15\"]]\ndf = df.fillna({'ARR_DEL15': 0})\ndf[\"ORIGIN\"] = df[\"ORIGIN\"].astype('category')\ndf[\"DEST\"] = df[\"DEST\"].astype('category')\ndf = pd.get_dummies(df)\n\nlr = LogisticRegression()\ntest_set, train_set = train_test_split(df, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\ntrain_set_x = train_set.drop('ARR_DEL15', axis=1)\ntrain_set_y = train_set[\"ARR_DEL15\"]\ntest_set_x = test_set.drop('ARR_DEL15', axis=1)\ntest_set_y = test_set[\"ARR_DEL15\"]\nlr.fit(train_set_x, train_set_y)\n\nprobabilities = lr.predict_proba(test_set_x)\nroc_auc_score(test_set_y, probabilities[:, 1])\n```\n\nWhy is the ROC AUC score much lower than the score provided by the `score` method?"

        "content": "The discrepancy between the accuracy score obtained from the `score` method and the ROC AUC score can be attributed to several factors. Let's break down what's happening here:\n\n1. **Accuracy vs. ROC AUC Score:**\n   - **Accuracy** (`score` method) measures the proportion of correctly predicted instances (both true positives and true negatives) out of the total number of instances. It does not consider the probabilities of predictions, only the final classification.\n   - **ROC AUC Score** measures the ability of the model to distinguish between classes, considering the predicted probabilities. It provides an aggregate measure of performance across all classification thresholds.\n\n2. **Class Imbalance:**\n   - If your dataset is imbalanced, meaning one class is significantly more frequent than the other, accuracy can be misleading. A model might predict the majority class most of the time and achieve high accuracy without truly capturing the underlying patterns, leading to a lower ROC AUC.\n\n3. **Threshold Sensitivity:**\n   - Accuracy is based on a fixed threshold (usually 0.5) for classification, while ROC AUC evaluates the model's performance across all potential thresholds. Thus, even if the model is slightly better than random guessing, it might still have a low ROC AUC score if it does not effectively rank predictions.\n\n4. **Feature Scaling:**\n   - Logistic Regression can be sensitive to the scale of input features. Ensure that your features are properly scaled, especially if they are on different scales. You might consider using `StandardScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing` to standardize your features.\n\n5. **Model Complexity:**\n   - The model might be too simple to capture complex patterns in the data. Consider adding interaction terms, polynomial features, or using a more complex model if necessary.\n\nTo investigate and address these issues:\n\n- **Check for Class Imbalance:**\n  ```python\n  print(train_set_y.value_counts(normalize=True))\n  ```\n\n- **Try Scaling Features:**\n  ```python\n  from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n\n  scaler = StandardScaler()\n  train_set_x_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(train_set_x)\n  test_set_x_scaled = scaler.transform(test_set_x)\n\n  lr.fit(train_set_x_scaled, train_set_y)\n  probabilities = lr.predict_proba(test_set_x_scaled)\n  print(roc_auc_score(test_set_y, probabilities[:, 1]))\n  ```\n\n- **Evaluate Other Metrics:**\n  - Consider other evaluation metrics like precision, recall, or F1-score to have a better understanding of the model performance.\n\nBy addressing these points, you might be able to achieve a ROC AUC score that better reflects the underlying performance of your model."
