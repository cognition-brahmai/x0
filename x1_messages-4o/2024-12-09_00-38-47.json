        "content": "Your current implementation is encountering issues because it attempts to update the global variable `w` from multiple processes, which isn't directly possible due to process isolation in Python's multiprocessing. Each process has its own memory space, and changes made to variables in one process are not reflected in the others.\n\nTo correctly accumulate the results, you can use a `multiprocessing.Manager` to coordinate shared data, or simply collect the results from each process and sum them up in the main process. Here is a modified version of your code using `Pool` to collect the results and then compute the sum:\n\n```python\nfrom multiprocessing import Pool\nfrom time import time\n\nN = 10\nK = 50\n\ndef CostlyFunction(z):\n    r = 0\n    for k in range(1, K+2):  # Changed xrange to range for Python 3\n        r += z ** (1 / k**1.5)\n    return r\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    currtime = time()\n\n    po = Pool()\n    \n    # Collect results from all processes\n    results = po.map(CostlyFunction, range(N))\n    \n    po.close()\n    po.join()\n\n    # Sum up all results\n    w = sum(results)\n    \n    print(w)\n    print('2: parallel: time elapsed:', time() - currtime)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Using `range` instead of `xrange`:** In Python 3, `xrange` is replaced with `range`.\n2. **Collecting Results with `map`:** Instead of `apply_async`, use `map` to collect all results in a list.\n3. **Sum the Results:** After collecting all results, sum them up outside the pool to get the total sum `w`.\n\nThis approach ensures that you correctly sum up the results and use multiprocessing effectively."
