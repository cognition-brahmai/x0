        "content": "The behavior you're observing is due to how Python handles chained comparisons and operator precedence.\n\n1. **Chained Comparisons**: In Python, expressions like `a is b is c` are evaluated as chained comparisons. This means that `a is b is c` is interpreted as `(a is b) and (b is c)`. The expression `False is False is False` is evaluated as `(False is False) and (False is False)`. Since both `False is False` are `True`, the entire expression evaluates to `True`.\n\n2. **Parentheses and Operator Precedence**: When you use parentheses as in `(False is False) is False`, the expression inside the parentheses is evaluated first. The expression `(False is False)` evaluates to `True` because `False is False` is indeed `True`. Then, the expression becomes `True is False`, which evaluates to `False` because `True` is not the same object as `False`.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- `False is False is False` evaluates to `True` because it's a chained comparison, equivalent to `(False is False) and (False is False)`, which is `True and True`.\n- `(False is False) is False` evaluates to `False` because the expression inside the parentheses evaluates to `True`, and then `True is False` evaluates to `False`."
