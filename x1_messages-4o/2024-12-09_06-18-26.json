        "content": "The `TypeError: 'int' object is not callable` error usually occurs when a variable named `round` is unintentionally shadowing the built-in `round()` function. This can happen if `round` has been assigned a value elsewhere in your code, such as:\n\n```python\nround = 5\n```\n\nIn your specific case, make sure that `round` hasn't been redefined anywhere in your code prior to the line where you're trying to use it as a function. If it has, you'll need to rename that variable to something else to avoid the conflict.\n\nHere's a way to ensure that the built-in `round()` function is used:\n\n1. Check if `round` is being assigned a value before its use as a function and rename that variable if necessary.\n2. Use the `round()` function like this:\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import division\n\na = 23\nb = 45\nc = 16\n\nresult = round((a/b) * 0.9 * c)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis should fix the error and allow you to successfully round off the output to an integer. If you still encounter issues, please double-check for any other parts of the code that might be redefining `round`."
