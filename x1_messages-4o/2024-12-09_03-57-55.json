Specifically, I have a Path object as follows:\n\n```python\nimport pathlib\npath = pathlib.Path(\"/home/user/to/some/folder/toto.out\")\n```\nHow can I modify the file name in this path to get a new path like \"/home/user/to/some/folder/other_file.dat\"? More generally, how can I change one or several elements of this path? I know I can get the parts of the path using `path.parts` as shown below:\n\n```python\nIn [1]: path.parts\nOut[1]: ('/', 'home', 'user', 'to', 'some', 'folder', 'toto.out')\n```\nA possible solution is joining the required parts, creating a new string and then a new path. But is there a more convenient way to achieve this? Additionally, is there an equivalent to `path.name` that returns the complementary part of the path, similar to `str(path).replace(path.name, \"\")`?"

        "content": "To modify parts of a `Path` object using the `pathlib` module, you can use various methods provided by the module to construct a new path without dealing directly with strings. Here's how you can change the file name of a path:\n\n1. **Using `with_name()` to change the file name:**\n\n```python\nimport pathlib\n\npath = pathlib.Path(\"/home/user/to/some/folder/toto.out\")\nnew_path = path.with_name(\"other_file.dat\")\n\nprint(new_path)  # Output: /home/user/to/some/folder/other_file.dat\n```\n\nThe `with_name()` method allows you to replace the file name while keeping the rest of the path unchanged.\n\n2. **Changing other parts of the path:**\n\nIf you need to change more than just the file name, you can use other methods like `with_suffix()`, `parent`, and direct manipulation of `path.parts`.\n\n- **Change the file extension using `with_suffix()`:**\n\n```python\nnew_path = path.with_suffix(\".dat\")\nprint(new_path)  # Output: /home/user/to/some/folder/toto.dat\n```\n\n- **Access and modify the parent directory:**\n\n```python\nnew_parent = path.parent / \"new_folder\"\nnew_path = new_parent / path.name\nprint(new_path)  # Output: /home/user/to/some/new_folder/toto.out\n```\n\n3. **Getting the path without the file name:**\n\nThere isn't a direct method equivalent to `path.name` for getting the complementary part of the path, but you can use `path.parent` to get the directory leading up to the file:\n\n```python\ndirectory_path = path.parent\nprint(directory_path)  # Output: /home/user/to/some/folder\n```\n\nIn summary, `pathlib` provides a flexible way to manipulate paths using methods like `with_name()`, `with_suffix()`, and `parent`, allowing you to construct new paths without manually handling strings."
