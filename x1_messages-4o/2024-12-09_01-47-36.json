        "content": "The error you're encountering, `cudaErrorAssert: device-side assert triggered`, is indicative of an assertion failure on the GPU. This type of error can be tricky to debug because it often involves invalid data being passed to CUDA operations. Let's go through some common causes and potential solutions:\n\n1. **Check Target Labels:** The stack trace suggests that the issue might be related to the target labels (`label_yaw_cont`). In particular, ensure that all target labels are valid. If you're using a classification loss like `CrossEntropyLoss`, make sure that target labels are integers in the range `[0, n_classes - 1]`. For regression tasks, ensure the labels are correctly formatted with no NaNs or invalid values.\n\n2. **Ensure Correct Tensor Dimensions:** Make sure that the dimensions of `yaw_predicted` and `label_yaw_cont` match the expected shapes required by the loss function. For `MSELoss`, both tensors should have the same shape.\n\n3. **DataLoader Issues:** Ensure that your data loading mechanism is not introducing any corrupt images or labels. You can add checks within your dataset class to verify that each image and label is loaded correctly.\n\n4. **NaN or Inf Values:** Check if `yaw_predicted` or `label_yaw_cont` contains any NaN or Inf values, which can cause operations to fail. You can add assertions or log these values during training to debug.\n\n5. **Batch Size:** Try reducing the batch size. Sometimes large batch sizes can lead to synchronization issues or out-of-memory errors that present as assertion failures.\n\n6. **CUDA Assertions:** Set the environment variable `CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1` before running your script. This will make CUDA operations synchronous and may provide more informative error messages.\n\n7. **Update PyTorch:** Ensure you are using the latest version of PyTorch, as bugs and issues are regularly fixed in new releases.\n\n8. **Custom Loss Functions:** If you have any custom loss functions or layers, ensure they are implemented correctly and aren\u2019t causing any illegal memory access.\n\nHere's a checklist of things to try in your code:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\n# Check for NaN or Inf in yaw_predicted and label_yaw_cont\nassert not torch.isnan(yaw_predicted).any(), \"NaN values found in yaw_predicted\"\nassert not torch.isnan(label_yaw_cont).any(), \"NaN values found in label_yaw_cont\"\nassert not torch.isinf(yaw_predicted).any(), \"Inf values found in yaw_predicted\"\nassert not torch.isinf(label_yaw_cont).any(), \"Inf values found in label_yaw_cont\"\n\n# Ensure target labels are within the expected range\nn_classes = 5  # Example number of classes, adjust as necessary\nassert torch.all(label_yaw_cont >= 0) and torch.all(label_yaw_cont < n_classes), \"Invalid target labels\"\n\n# Set CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1\nimport os\nos.environ['CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING'] = '1'\n\n# Reduce batch size\nbatch_size = 16  # Example smaller batch size\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the root cause of the issue."
