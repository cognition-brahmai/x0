You can use list slicing, which is both concise and more efficient, especially for larger lists. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nlst = lst[:-n]\n```\n\nThis line of code will create a new list that excludes the last `N` elements, effectively removing them. The `:-n` slice takes all elements of the list except the last `N` elements.\n\nIf you want to modify the list in place without creating a new list, you can do:\n\n```python\ndel lst[-n:]\n```\n\nThis will directly modify the original list by deleting the last `N` elements, and it's more efficient in terms of memory usage compared to creating a new list."
