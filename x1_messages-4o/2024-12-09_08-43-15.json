For example, consider a list of integers:\n\n```python\nlistOfNumbers = range(100)\n```\n\nAnd a function that checks if the element meets a certain condition:\n\n```python\ndef meetsCondition(element):\n    return bool(element != 0 and element % 7 == 0)\n```\n\nThe objective is to return a sub-list of elements in `listOfNumbers` for which `meetsCondition(element)` is `True`. A naive approach would be:\n\n```python\ndef subList(inputList):\n    outputList = []\n\n    for element in inputList:\n        if meetsCondition(element):\n            outputList.append(element)\n\n    return outputList\n\ndivisibleBySeven = subList(listOfNumbers)\n```\n\nIs there a more efficient way to do this, preferably using list comprehension or `set()` functions, and without creating a temporary `outputList`?"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this in a more Pythonic way using list comprehension. List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists and are generally more efficient than using loops to build a list. Here's how you can rewrite the `subList` function using list comprehension:\n\n```python\nlistOfNumbers = range(100)\n\ndef meetsCondition(element):\n    return bool(element != 0 and element % 7 == 0)\n\n# Using list comprehension to generate the sub-list\ndivisibleBySeven = [element for element in listOfNumbers if meetsCondition(element)]\n\nprint(divisibleBySeven)\n```\n\nIn this approach, we use a list comprehension to iterate over each `element` in `listOfNumbers`. The expression `element for element in listOfNumbers if meetsCondition(element)` constructs a new list by evaluating `meetsCondition(element)` for each `element` in the original list and includes it in the new list only if the condition is `True`.\n\nThis method is not only more concise but often more readable and efficient, as list comprehensions are optimized for performance in Python."
