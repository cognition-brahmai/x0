According to the [documentation](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#magic-timeit), there are various options such as -n and -r. I understand that `-n` is used to execute the given statement 'n' times in a loop. However, I am confused about what `-r` does. For instance, if I write `%timeit -n 250 -r 2 [i+1 for i in range(5000)]`, does `-n 250` mean that the list comprehension `[i+1 for i in range(5000)]` is executed 250 times? If this is correct, then what does `-r 2` mean?"

        "content": "In IPython, the `%timeit` magic command is used to measure the execution time of a single statement or block of code. It's very useful for performance testing and optimization purposes.\n\nWhen you use the `%timeit` command with options like `-n` and `-r`, here's what they mean:\n\n- `-n`: This option specifies the number of times the code is executed in a single loop. So, when you write `-n 250`, it means that the code snippet will be executed 250 times in a single timing run. This helps in getting a more accurate average execution time for very fast-running code snippets.\n\n- `-r`: This option specifies the number of times the entire loop (of `n` executions) is repeated. The result will be the best time from these `r` runs. In your example, `-r 2` indicates that the loop (which runs the code 250 times) will be repeated twice, and the best timing will be reported.\n\nSo, in your specific command `%timeit -n 250 -r 2 [i+1 for i in range(5000)]`, the list comprehension `[i+1 for i in range(5000)]` is executed 250 times in one cycle, and this entire cycle is repeated 2 times. The reported time will be the best (fastest) of these two cycles.\n\nThe reason for repeating the measurement (`-r`) is to account for variability in execution time due to factors such as CPU load, caching effects, and other system activities. By taking the best of the `r` repetitions, `%timeit` helps provide a more stable measurement."
