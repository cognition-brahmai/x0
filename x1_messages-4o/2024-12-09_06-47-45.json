        "content": "How can I duplicate sys.stdout to a log file in Python? I have an application that operates in two modes: interactive and daemon. In interactive mode, I want all output, including that from system calls, to be displayed on the screen and logged to a file. In daemon mode, all output should be directed to the log file. Daemon mode works well with os.dup2(), but I'm having trouble finding a way to \"tee\" all output to a log in interactive mode without modifying each system call. I want the equivalent functionality of the command line 'tee' for any output generated by the Python application, including system call output. Here's what I've tried:\n\n```python\n# open our log file\nso = se = open(\"%s.log\" % self.name, 'w', 0)\n\n# re-open stdout without buffering\nsys.stdout = os.fdopen(sys.stdout.fileno(), 'w', 0)\n\n# redirect stdout and stderr to the log file opened above\nos.dup2(so.fileno(), sys.stdout.fileno())\nos.dup2(se.fileno(), sys.stderr.fileno())\n\n# Test\nimport os, sys\n\n### my broken solution:\nso = se = open(\"a.log\", 'w', 0)\nsys.stdout = os.fdopen(sys.stdout.fileno(), 'w', 0)\n\nos.dup2(sys.stdout.fileno(), so.fileno())\nos.dup2(sys.stderr.fileno(), se.fileno())\n###\n\nprint(\"foo bar\")\n\nos.spawnve(\"P_WAIT\", \"/bin/ls\", [\"/bin/ls\"], {})\nos.execve(\"/bin/ls\", [\"/bin/ls\"], os.environ)\n```\n\nBut the file \"a.log\" is not identical to what was displayed on the screen. What am I doing wrong?"

        "content": "To achieve the functionality you're looking for, you need to effectively \"tee\" the output, meaning you want to write to both standard output and a file simultaneously. The issue with your current approach is that you're redirecting the output rather than duplicating it. \n\nOne common solution is to create a custom file-like object that writes to both the original `sys.stdout` and your log file. Here\u2019s a way to implement a simple `Tee` class that does exactly that:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport sys\n\nclass Tee:\n    def __init__(self, name, mode='w'):\n        self.file = open(name, mode)\n        self.stdout = sys.stdout\n        self.stderr = sys.stderr\n\n    def __del__(self):\n        self.file.close()\n\n    def write(self, message):\n        self.stdout.write(message)\n        self.file.write(message)\n        self.file.flush()  # Ensure it's written to the file immediately\n\n    def flush(self):\n        self.stdout.flush()\n        self.file.flush()\n\ndef interactive_mode(log_filename):\n    sys.stdout = Tee(log_filename)\n    sys.stderr = sys.stdout\n\ndef daemon_mode(log_filename):\n    log_file = open(log_filename, 'w')\n    os.dup2(log_file.fileno(), sys.stdout.fileno())\n    os.dup2(log_file.fileno(), sys.stderr.fileno())\n\n# Example usage\nmode = 'interactive'  # or 'daemon'\nlog_filename = \"a.log\"\n\nif mode == 'interactive':\n    interactive_mode(log_filename)\nelif mode == 'daemon':\n    daemon_mode(log_filename)\n\nprint(\"foo bar\")\nos.system(\"ls\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Tee Class**: This class is designed to write to both the original `sys.stdout` and a file. It overrides the `write` and `flush` methods to handle the output.\n\n2. **Interactive Mode**: In this mode, `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` are replaced with instances of the `Tee` class, which will duplicate output to the console and log file.\n\n3. **Daemon Mode**: In this mode, `os.dup2()` is used to redirect `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` to the log file, effectively silencing console output.\n\n4. **Flush**: It's important to flush the file buffer to ensure that output is written immediately, which is especially useful for real-time logging.\n\nThis approach should help you log both the interactive and daemon mode outputs correctly to your log file and console as intended."
