Specifically, I want to add functionality to check some values of a list of integers that is one of the fields in the data class upon initialization."

        "content": "Yes, you can add additional initialization logic to a Python `dataclass` by using the `__post_init__` method. This method is called automatically after the built-in initializer `__init__` is executed. You can use it to perform any additional setup or validation, such as checking values of a list of integers.\n\nHere's an example of how you might implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom typing import List\n\n@dataclass\nclass MyDataClass:\n    numbers: List[int] = field(default_factory=list)\n\n    def __post_init__(self):\n        # Additional initialization logic\n        for number in self.numbers:\n            if not isinstance(number, int):\n                raise ValueError(f\"All elements must be integers, but found: {number}\")\n            # You can add more checks or initializations as needed\n            if number < 0:\n                raise ValueError(f\"All elements must be non-negative, but found: {number}\")\n\n# Example usage\ntry:\n    obj = MyDataClass(numbers=[1, 2, 3, -4])  # This will raise a ValueError\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(e)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `__post_init__` method checks that all elements in the `numbers` list are integers and are non-negative. If any element does not satisfy these conditions, a `ValueError` is raised.\n\nYou can adjust the logic inside `__post_init__` to suit your specific requirements, such as additional validations or computations based on the initial values of the fields."
