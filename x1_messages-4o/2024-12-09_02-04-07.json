I am suspecting this might be an issue with OSX Yosemite because I recently upgraded to it and I didn't have any problem installing scipy before. Could you please help me understand how can I get scipy to build successfully? Here's the error message and debug log I received:\n\nError:\n```\nCleaning up...\nCommand /Users/administrator/dev/KaggleAux/env/bin/python2.7 -c \"import setuptools, tokenize;__file__='/Users/administrator/dev/KaggleAux/env/build/scipy/setup.py';exec(compile(getattr(tokenize, 'open', open)(__file__).read().replace('\\r\\n', '\\n'), __file__, 'exec'))\" install --record /var/folders/zl/7698ng4d4nxd49q1845jd9340000gn/T/pip-eO8gua-record/install-record.txt --single-version-externally-managed --compile --install-headers /Users/administrator/dev/KaggleAux/env/bin/../include/site/python2.7 failed with error code 1 in /Users/administrator/dev/KaggleAux/env/build/scipy\nStoring debug log for failure in /Users/administrator/.pip/pip.log\n```\nDebug log:\n```\nCleaning up...\n  Removing temporary dir /Users/administrator/dev/KaggleAux/env/build...\nCommand /Users/administrator/dev/KaggleAux/env/bin/python2.7 -c \"import setuptools, tokenize;__file__='/Users/administrator/dev/KaggleAux/env/build/scipy/setup.py';exec(compile(getattr(tokenize, 'open', open)(__file__).read().replace('\\r\\n', '\\n'), __file__, 'exec'))\" install --record /var/folders/zl/7698ng4d4nxd49q1845jd9340000gn/T/pip-eO8gua-record/install-record.txt --single-version-externally-managed --compile --install-headers /Users/administrator/dev/KaggleAux/env/bin/../include/site/python2.7 failed with error code 1 in /Users/administrator/dev/KaggleAux/env/build/scipy\nException information:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Users/administrator/dev/KaggleAux/env/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pip/basecommand.py\", line 122, in main\n    status = self.run(options, args)\n  File \"/Users/administrator/dev/KaggleAux/env/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pip/commands/install.py\", line 283, in run\n    requirement_set.install(install_options, global_options, root=options.root_path)\n  File \"/Users/administrator/dev/KaggleAux/env/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pip/req.py\", line 1435, in install\n    requirement.install(install_options, global_options, *args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/Users/administrator/dev/KaggleAux/env/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pip/req.py\", line 706, in install\n    cwd=self.source_dir, filter_stdout=self._filter_install, show_stdout=False)\n  File \"/Users/administrator/dev/KaggleAux/env/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pip/util.py\", line 697, in call_subprocess\n    % (command_desc, proc.returncode, cwd))\nInstallationError: Command /Users/administrator/dev/KaggleAux/env/bin/python2.7 -c \"import setuptools, tokenize;__file__='/Users/administrator/dev/KaggleAux/env/build/scipy/setup.py';exec(compile(getattr(tokenize, 'open', open)(__file__).read().replace('\\r\\n', '\\n'), __file__, 'exec'))\" install --record /var/folders/zl/7698ng4d4nxd49q1845jd9340000gn/T/pip-eO8gua-record/install-record.txt --single-version-externally-managed --compile --install-headers /Users/administrator/dev/KaggleAux/env/bin/../include/site/python2.7 failed with error code 1 in /Users/administrator/dev/KaggleAux/env/build/scipy\n```"

        "content": "Installing `scipy` on OSX Yosemite can be tricky due to various dependencies and compatibility issues, especially with Python 2.7. Here are a few steps you can follow to troubleshoot and resolve the installation issue:\n\n1. **Update pip and setuptools**:\n   Ensure that you have the latest version of `pip` and `setuptools`, as older versions might have bugs or lack support for certain features.\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade pip setuptools\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Xcode Command Line Tools**:\n   Make sure you have the Xcode Command Line Tools installed, as they provide necessary compilers and libraries.\n   ```bash\n   xcode-select --install\n   ```\n\n3. **Install Homebrew** (if not already installed):\n   Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that simplifies the installation of software.\n   ```bash\n   /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Install necessary dependencies**:\n   Use Homebrew to install `gfortran`, which is often required for compiling `scipy`.\n   ```bash\n   brew install gcc\n   ```\n\n5. **Use a virtual environment**:\n   It's recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with system packages.\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n6. **Install numpy first**:\n   `scipy` depends on `numpy`, so ensure `numpy` is installed before attempting to install `scipy`.\n   ```bash\n   pip install numpy\n   ```\n\n7. **Install scipy**:\n   Now try installing `scipy` again.\n   ```bash\n   pip install scipy\n   ```\n\n8. **Use pre-built binaries (wheels)**:\n   If building from source is problematic, try using pre-built wheels. You can find these on sites like [https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) (though primarily for Windows) or check PyPI for available wheels.\n\n9. **Check Python version compatibility**:\n   Consider upgrading to a newer Python version, as Python 2.7 is no longer supported and it might lead to compatibility issues with newer packages.\n\nIf you continue to face issues, please provide any additional error messages that appear, as they might give more insight into the specific problem you are encountering."
