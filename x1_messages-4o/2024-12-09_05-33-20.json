        "content": "The error you are encountering is because the `datetime` module has not been imported before you tried to use it. In Python, you need to explicitly import modules before using them. Here\u2019s how you can use the `datetime` module to get today\u2019s date:\n\n1. First, import the `datetime` module.\n2. Then, use `datetime.date.today()` to get today\u2019s date.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndate = datetime.date.today()\nprint(date)\n```\n\nThis should work without any errors. The `import datetime` statement makes the `datetime` module available in your script, allowing you to access its classes and functions. Make sure to include this import statement at the beginning of your script or interactive session."
