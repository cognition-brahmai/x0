        "content": "Certainly! Here are five unique camping tasks designed to test your logical reasoning abilities, presented using LaTeX formatting:\n\n1. **Task 1: Tent Arrangement Puzzle**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Given three tents (A, B, C) and three campers (X, Y, Z), arrange the campers so that no camper is in a tent adjacent to their preference.}\n   \\]\n   - Camper X prefers tent A.\n   - Camper Y prefers tent B.\n   - Camper Z prefers tent C.\n\n2. **Task 2: Campfire Cooking Problem**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{You have a pot that can hold 10L and a recipe that requires 7L. Using only a 10L and a 3L container, measure exactly 7L.}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Task 3: Hiking Route Optimization**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{You have 5 campsites (P, Q, R, S, T) connected by trails. Find the shortest path visiting each site exactly once and returning to the starting point.}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Task 4: Water Filtration Puzzle**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{You have a 12L container of dirty water and need to get exactly 5L of clean water using only a 12L and a 7L container.}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Task 5: Campfire Riddle**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Three friends (Alice, Bob, and Carol) are roasting marshmallows. Each makes a statement:}\n   \\]\n   - Alice: \u201cI have more marshmallows than Bob.\u201d\n   - Bob: \u201cI have fewer marshmallows than Carol.\u201d\n   - Carol: \u201cI have fewer marshmallows than Alice.\u201d\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{If only one statement is true, who has the most marshmallows?}\n   \\]\n\nThese tasks will not only test your logical reasoning but also your ability to think critically and solve problems using limited resources. Enjoy your camping adventure!"
