        "content": "I'm trying to run hierarchical clustering on a correlation matrix using scipy/numpy in Python. My matrix comprises of 100 rows and 9 columns and I want to cluster based on correlations of each entry across the 9 conditions. I want to utilize 1-pearson correlation as the distance for clustering. Assuming I have a numpy array 'X' that contains the 100 x 9 matrix, how can I achieve this? I attempted to use hcluster, as per the example below:\n\n```python\nY=pdist(X, 'seuclidean')\nZ=linkage(Y, 'single')\ndendrogram(Z, color_threshold=0)\n```\n\nHowever, I discovered that 'pdist' is not suitable for my needs as it calculates euclidean distance. Do you have any suggestions on how to resolve this?"

        "content": "To perform hierarchical clustering using 1 minus the Pearson correlation as the distance metric, you can modify your approach to calculate the pairwise distances using Pearson correlation and then transform them into a distance metric suitable for clustering. Here's how you can do it with `scipy`:\n\n1. Calculate the Pearson correlation matrix for your data.\n2. Transform the correlation matrix into a distance matrix by subtracting the correlation values from 1.\n3. Use this distance matrix with the `linkage` function to perform hierarchical clustering.\n\nHere's a step-by-step implementation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.spatial.distance import squareform\nfrom scipy.cluster.hierarchy import linkage, dendrogram\nfrom scipy.stats import pearsonr\n\n# Assume 'X' is your 100 x 9 matrix\nX = np.random.rand(100, 9)  # Example data\n\n# Create an empty distance matrix\nnum_samples = X.shape[0]\ndistance_matrix = np.zeros((num_samples, num_samples))\n\n# Calculate 1 - Pearson correlation for each pair of samples\nfor i in range(num_samples):\n    for j in range(i+1, num_samples):\n        corr, _ = pearsonr(X[i], X[j])\n        distance_matrix[i, j] = 1 - corr\n        distance_matrix[j, i] = distance_matrix[i, j]\n\n# Convert the distance matrix to a condensed form\ncondensed_distance_matrix = squareform(distance_matrix)\n\n# Perform hierarchical clustering\nZ = linkage(condensed_distance_matrix, method='single')\n\n# Plot the dendrogram\ndendrogram(Z, color_threshold=0)\n\n# Optional: Show the plot\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- `pearsonr` calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient between two sets of data.\n- `squareform` is used to convert the square distance matrix into a condensed form that `linkage` can accept.\n- The `linkage` method can be adjusted (e.g., 'single', 'complete', 'average') based on your clustering preferences.\n\nThis code snippet should help you achieve hierarchical clustering based on 1 minus the Pearson correlation. Adjust the `linkage` method according to your specific needs for clustering behaviour."
