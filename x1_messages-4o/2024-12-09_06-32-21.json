        "content": "The error message \"ImportError: No module named git\" indicates that Python cannot find the `git` module, which typically refers to the `GitPython` library, not the Git executable itself. The location of the Git executable (`/usr/local/bin/git` vs `/usr/bin/git`) is unrelated to this ImportError, which is due to a missing Python library.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Install GitPython**: First, ensure you have the `GitPython` library installed in your Python environment. You can do this using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install GitPython\n   ```\n\n   If you're using Python 3, you might need to use `pip3` instead:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip3 install GitPython\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify Installation**: After installation, verify that the library is correctly installed by trying to import it in a Python shell:\n\n   ```python\n   import git\n   ```\n\n   If this doesn't raise an error, the installation was successful.\n\n3. **Python Environment**: Ensure that the Python interpreter running your script is the same one where you installed `GitPython`. If you're using a virtual environment, activate it before installing or running your script:\n\n   ```bash\n   source /path/to/your/venv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for Multiple Python Versions**: If you have multiple versions of Python installed, ensure you're using the correct version. You can check the version by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   python --version\n   ```\n\n   or\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 --version\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to fix the ImportError and successfully use the `git` module in your Python code. If you're still having trouble, double-check the Python environment and paths to ensure everything is set up correctly."
