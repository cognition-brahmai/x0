        "content": "To use `os.walk` in Python to list all files along with their containing directory paths while excluding hidden folders and files in a Linux environment, you can follow these steps. Hidden files and directories in Linux start with a dot (`.`), so you can skip any file or directory whose name starts with a dot.\n\nHere's a Python script that demonstrates how to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef list_files_excluding_hidden(root_directory):\n    for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in os.walk(root_directory):\n        # Filter out hidden directories\n        dirnames[:] = [d for d in dirnames if not d.startswith('.')]\n        \n        # Filter out hidden files\n        filenames = [f for f in filenames if not f.startswith('.')]\n        \n        # Print all non-hidden files with their full path\n        for filename in filenames:\n            full_path = os.path.join(dirpath, filename)\n            print(full_path)\n\n# Specify the root directory you want to start the search from\nroot_dir = '/path/to/your/folder'\nlist_files_excluding_hidden(root_dir)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **`os.walk`**: This function generates the file names in a directory tree by walking the tree either top-down or bottom-up.\n\n2. **`dirnames[:] = ...`**: This line modifies the `dirnames` list in place to exclude any directory names that start with a dot, effectively skipping hidden directories.\n\n3. **`filenames = ...`**: This line creates a new list of filenames that excludes any files starting with a dot, effectively skipping hidden files.\n\n4. **`os.path.join(dirpath, filename)`**: This constructs the full path to each file found within the directories.\n\nReplace `'/path/to/your/folder'` with the path to the directory you want to search. This script will print the full paths of all visible files within that directory and its subdirectories."
