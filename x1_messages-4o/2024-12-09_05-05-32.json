        "content": "The error you're encountering, `jinja2.exceptions.TemplateNotFound`, suggests that Flask's `render_template` function cannot locate the template file you're trying to render. In your case, it seems to be looking for the template at `static/themes/default/login.html`.\n\nHere are a few things to check and consider:\n\n1. **Template Directory Structure**: Flask uses a `templates` folder by default to look for templates. Make sure your `login.html` is located inside a directory that Flask recognizes as a template directory. Typically, your directory structure should look something like this:\n   ```\n   your_project/\n       app.py\n       templates/\n           themes/\n               default/\n                   login.html\n   ```\n\n2. **Correct Template Path**: Since Flask expects templates to be in the `templates` folder, you only need to specify the path relative to it. Assuming your templates are in the `templates` directory, your `render_template` call should look like this:\n\n   ```python\n   return render_template(f'themes/{g.blogOptions[\"active_theme\"]}/login.html', blogOptions=g.blogOptions, ref=ref)\n   ```\n\n3. **Configuration Check**: Ensure that your Flask app is set to use the correct template folder if you've customized it. This can be done using:\n   ```python\n   app = Flask(__name__, template_folder='your_template_folder')\n   ```\n\n4. **Path Verification**: Double-check the path to the `login.html` file. Make sure there are no typos and the file is indeed in the location you expect it to be.\n\n5. **File Permissions**: Ensure that your application has the necessary permissions to read the template files.\n\n6. **Active Theme Configuration**: Verify that `g.blogOptions['active_theme']` is correctly set to `default` or whatever theme you intend to use.\n\n7. **Server Restart**: After making changes to the template location or code, restart your Flask server to ensure changes take effect.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `TemplateNotFound` error and ensure your Flask application can find and render the `login.html` template correctly."
