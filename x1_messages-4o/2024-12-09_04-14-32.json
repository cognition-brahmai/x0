I have just installed XCode for the C++ compiler and Anaconda with the latest Python 3 version for personal use. Now, I want to install another version of Anaconda for work-related tasks with Python 2. I need to use both versions in iPython and Spyder IDE and wish to have completely separated Python environments. How can I set up so that I would be able to use commands like `conda install scikit-learn` for Python 3 environment and `conda2 install scikit-learn` for Python 2?"

        "content": "Installing and managing two separate versions of Anaconda to work with both Python 2 and Python 3 on macOS involves creating isolated environments. Anaconda has a built-in solution for managing such environments, which allows you to switch between different Python versions easily. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n### Step 1: Install Anaconda\n\n1. **Download and Install Anaconda for Python 3.**\n   - Visit the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and download the installer for Python 3.\n   - Follow the instructions to install it.\n\n2. **Set Up a Separate Environment for Python 2.**\n\n### Step 2: Create and Manage Environments\n\n1. **Open Terminal** on your Mac.\n\n2. **Create a Python 2 Environment:**\n   ```bash\n   conda create --name py2env python=2.7\n   ```\n   This command creates a new environment named `py2env` with Python 2.7 installed.\n\n3. **Create a Python 3 Environment (if needed):**\n   ```bash\n   conda create --name py3env python=3.8\n   ```\n   Replace `3.8` with the desired Python 3 version if you need a specific version.\n\n### Step 3: Activate Environments\n\n- **Activate the Python 2 Environment:**\n  ```bash\n  conda activate py2env\n  ```\n\n- **Activate the Python 3 Environment:**\n  ```bash\n  conda activate py3env\n  ```\n\n### Step 4: Install Packages in Each Environment\n\n- **Installing Packages in Python 2 Environment:**\n  ```bash\n  conda activate py2env\n  conda install scikit-learn\n  ```\n\n- **Installing Packages in Python 3 Environment:**\n  ```bash\n  conda activate py3env\n  conda install scikit-learn\n  ```\n\n### Step 5: Use iPython and Spyder IDE\n\n- **For Python 2:**\n  - Activate the Python 2 environment first (`conda activate py2env`).\n  - Launch iPython or Spyder:\n    ```bash\n    ipython\n    ```\n    ```bash\n    spyder\n    ```\n\n- **For Python 3:**\n  - Activate the Python 3 environment first (`conda activate py3env`).\n  - Launch iPython or Spyder similarly.\n\n### Additional Tips\n\n- **Switching Environments:** Use `conda activate <env_name>` and `conda deactivate` to switch between environments.\n\n- **Environment Management:**\n  - List all environments:\n    ```bash\n    conda info --envs\n    ```\n  - Remove an environment:\n    ```bash\n    conda remove --name <env_name> --all\n    ```\n\nBy using separate environments, you will have isolated installations of Python 2 and Python 3, each with its own set of packages. This way, you can maintain different project requirements without conflicts."
