For example:\n\n```python\nclass User(object):\n   first_name = models.CharField(..\n\n   def get_username(self):\n       return self.username\n\nclass User(models.Model):\n   first_name = models.CharField(...\n\n   def get_username(self):\n       return self.username\n\n   class Meta:\n       abstract = True\n\nclass Employee(User):\n   title = models.CharField(...\n```"

        "content": "In Django, using an abstract model versus using plain Python inheritance involves some key differences, particularly in how the classes are integrated with Django\u2019s ORM and how they are used in database schema design. Let's break down the distinctions:\n\n### Abstract Models\n\n1. **Inheritance with Django's ORM**:\n   - An abstract model is a Django model class where `Meta: abstract = True` is defined.\n   - Classes that inherit from an abstract model will not create a separate table in the database for the abstract model itself. Instead, the fields and methods defined in the abstract model are included in the concrete subclasses that inherit from it.\n   - An abstract model is typically used to define common fields, methods, or behaviors that should be shared among multiple models without creating a separate table for those common elements.\n\n2. **Database Integration**:\n   - Fields in an abstract model are defined using Django\u2019s ORM field types (e.g., `models.CharField`), and they integrate with the database schema when concrete subclasses are created.\n   - When a subclass of an abstract model is defined, it gets its own table in the database, and that table includes fields from the abstract model along with its own specific fields.\n\n3. **Django-Specific Features**:\n   - Abstract models can leverage Django\u2019s features such as querysets, migrations, and model methods.\n\n### Plain Python Inheritance\n\n1. **Inheritance without Django's ORM**:\n   - A plain Python class that inherits from `object` (or simply doesn\u2019t specify a parent class) is just a standard Python class and is not integrated into Django\u2019s ORM.\n   - Such a class can define methods or attributes, but it doesn\u2019t map those attributes to database fields.\n\n2. **Database Integration**:\n   - Since a plain Python parent class doesn\u2019t use Django\u2019s field types, it does not contribute to the database schema of its subclasses. There is no automatic translation of its attributes into database fields.\n   - Any model class that inherits from a plain Python class must separately define its fields using Django\u2019s ORM field types in order for those fields to be part of the database schema.\n\n3. **Django-Specific Features**:\n   - Plain Python classes do not benefit from Django\u2019s ORM features, such as automatic migrations or query interfaces.\n\n### Example Explanation\n\nIn your example:\n\n- **User as a Plain Python Class**:\n  ```python\n  class User(object):\n      first_name = models.CharField(...)\n      \n      def get_username(self):\n          return self.username\n  ```\n  - This class does not directly integrate with Django's ORM. Any attributes defined here are not translated into database fields automatically.\n\n- **User as an Abstract Model**:\n  ```python\n  class User(models.Model):\n      first_name = models.CharField(...)\n      \n      def get_username(self):\n          return self.username\n      \n      class Meta:\n          abstract = True\n  ```\n  - This is an abstract model. Any class inheriting from this will include `first_name` as a database field in its own table.\n\n- **Employee Inheriting from User**:\n  - If `User` is a plain Python class, `Employee` must define its own fields using Django\u2019s ORM to include them in the database schema.\n  - If `User` is an abstract model, `Employee` automatically includes `first_name` as a database field through inheritance and gets its own table.\n\nIn summary, using an abstract model allows you to leverage Django's ORM to share fields and functionality across models, whereas using a plain Python class provides no ORM integration and requires explicit field definitions in each model."
