For example, I have a DataFrame as follows:\n\n```python\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n                'A':[1,2,'Three',4],\n                'B':[1,'Two',3,4]})\ndf\n   A    B\n0  1    1\n1  2  Two\n2  Three 3\n3  4    4\n```\n\nI want to select the row where the type of data in the \"A\" column is a string. I tried the following code, but it does not work:\n\n```python\ndf[type(df.A) == str]\n```\n\nCan you please help me to solve this problem?"

        "content": "To select rows from a DataFrame based on the type of data in a particular column, you can use the `apply` method along with a boolean mask. In this case, you want to select rows where the type of data in column \"A\" is a string. You can achieve this using the `apply` method to check the type of each element in the column and then use boolean indexing to filter the rows. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Create the DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    'A': [1, 2, 'Three', 4],\n    'B': [1, 'Two', 3, 4]\n})\n\n# Create a boolean mask where the type of the element in column 'A' is str\nmask = df['A'].apply(lambda x: isinstance(x, str))\n\n# Use the mask to filter the DataFrame\nresult = df[mask]\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n       A  B\n2  Three  3\n```\n\nIn this code, `apply(lambda x: isinstance(x, str))` checks each element in column \"A\" to see if it's a string, and `df[mask]` uses the resulting boolean series to filter the DataFrame."
