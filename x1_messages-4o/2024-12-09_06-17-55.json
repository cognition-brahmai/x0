When Django generates HTML for this form, it creates a select box with one option for each row in the table referenced by the ForeignKey. It also creates an option at the top of the list that has no value and displays as a series of dashes. I have configured the ForeignKey field as `verb = models.ForeignKey(Verb, blank=False, default=get_default_verb)`. This sets the default so that it's no longer the empty/dashes option but the empty/dashes option still appears in the list. How can I either remove this auto-generated option from the select box or customize it to show as: `<option value=\"\">Select Item</option>`?"

        "content": "In Django forms, when you have a `ForeignKey` field in a `ModelForm`, the default behavior is to include an empty option in the dropdown list, which allows users to submit an empty value for that field. However, if you want to customize or remove this empty option, you can achieve this by overriding the form's field in your `ModelForm`.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Remove the Empty Option:**\n\n   If you want to completely remove the empty option from the dropdown, you can set the `empty_label` attribute to `None`. This is done when you define the field in the form:\n\n   ```python\n   from django import forms\n   from .models import YourModel\n\n   class YourModelForm(forms.ModelForm):\n       class Meta:\n           model = YourModel\n           fields = ['verb', ...]\n\n       def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n           super(YourModelForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n           self.fields['verb'].empty_label = None\n   ```\n\n   By setting `empty_label` to `None`, the empty option will be removed from the dropdown list.\n\n2. **Customize the Empty Option:**\n\n   If you want to customize the empty option text, you can set the `empty_label` attribute with your custom text:\n\n   ```python\n   from django import forms\n   from .models import YourModel\n\n   class YourModelForm(forms.ModelForm):\n       class Meta:\n           model = YourModel\n           fields = ['verb', ...]\n\n       def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n           super(YourModelForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n           self.fields['verb'].empty_label = \"Select Item\"\n   ```\n\n   This will change the display text of the empty option to \"Select Item\".\n\nBy customizing the form in this way, you can control the appearance and behavior of the `ForeignKey` dropdown list to better fit your application's requirements."
