        "content": "When using the Python extension in Visual Studio Code for debugging, it can be tricky to handle input from the command line. If the debugger seems to hang when it encounters an input statement, follow these steps to handle it effectively:\n\n1. **Integrated Terminal**: Make sure that your debugging is set to use the integrated terminal where you can provide input. You can configure this in your `launch.json` file by setting `\"console\": \"integratedTerminal\"`. This configuration will ensure that the input is read from the terminal where you can interact with it.\n\n    Here's an example of how your `launch.json` configuration might look:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n        \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n        \"configurations\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"Python: Current File\",\n                \"type\": \"python\",\n                \"request\": \"launch\",\n                \"program\": \"${file}\",\n                \"console\": \"integratedTerminal\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    ```\n\n2. **External Terminal**: If you prefer or if the integrated terminal doesn't work as expected, you can set `\"console\": \"externalTerminal\"` in your `launch.json` to open an external terminal window where you can provide input.\n\n3. **Check Debugging Settings**: Ensure that your Python extension and Visual Studio Code are up to date. Sometimes, issues with debugging and input can be resolved by updating to the latest versions.\n\n4. **Use Debug Console for Inputs**: If for some reason the above solutions do not work, try using the Debug Console to simulate input. This is more of a workaround and might not work in every scenario, but it can help in specific cases.\n\n5. **Breakpoints and Step Over**: Use breakpoints and step over the input line to see if the debugger allows you to manually enter input at that point. This can sometimes trigger the input prompt in the console.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to provide input during a debugging session in Visual Studio Code. If you continue to encounter issues, consider checking the Visual Studio Code documentation or community forums for any recent updates or known issues related to debugging with input."
