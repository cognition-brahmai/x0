Here is my code:\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import print_function\nfrom urllib2 import Request, urlopen, URLError\nimport requests\nimport boto3\nimport json\n\ndef lambda_handler(event, context):\n    url = \"https://globalcurrencies.xignite.com/xGlobalCurrencies.json/GetHistoricalRatesRange?Symbol=BTCUSD&amp;PriceType=Mid&amp;StartDate=01/01/2017&amp;EndDate=10/27/2017&amp;PeriodType=Daily&amp;FixingTime=22:00&amp;_token=some_token_xyz\"\n    response = requests.get(url).json()\n    # print json.dumps(response, indent=4) # gives a syntax error\n    return response\n```\n\nThe name of my file is `lambda_function.py`. I've seen a few similar problems on StackOverflow where some users suggested changing the file naming, but this solution didn't work for me. The Python method was named as shown in this image: \n\n![Python Method Naming](https://i.stack.imgur.com/eFIGR.png)\n\nI am getting the following error: \n\n```\nSTART RequestId: cf24e9be-bbef-11e7-97b4-d9b586307f3e Version: $LATEST\nUnable to import module 'lambda_function': No module named requests\n```\n\nAlso, I get a syntax error when I try to print something. Can someone suggest any solutions?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering has two main issues:\n\n1. **Missing Requests Module**: \n   The error \"No module named requests\" indicates that the `requests` library is not available in your AWS Lambda environment. By default, AWS Lambda doesn't include third-party libraries like `requests`. You need to package this library along with your Lambda function.\n\n   Here\u2019s how you can package the `requests` library with your Lambda function:\n\n   - **Option 1: Use Lambda Layers**:\n     - Create a Lambda Layer containing the `requests` library. You can do this by creating a directory structure like `python/lib/python3.x/site-packages/` and installing the `requests` library there using pip:\n       ```bash\n       mkdir -p python/lib/python3.x/site-packages/\n       pip install requests -t python/lib/python3.x/site-packages/\n       zip -r9 lambda_layer.zip python\n       ```\n     - Upload the `lambda_layer.zip` file to AWS Lambda Layers via the console or CLI.\n     - Attach the layer to your Lambda function.\n\n   - **Option 2: Package with Function**:\n     - Create a deployment package containing your `lambda_function.py` and the `requests` library.\n       ```bash\n       pip install requests -t .\n       zip -r9 lambda_function.zip .\n       ```\n     - Upload the `lambda_function.zip` to AWS Lambda.\n\n2. **Syntax Error with Print**:\n   You mentioned getting a syntax error with the `print` statement. The code snippet you posted uses Python 2-style print functions, but AWS Lambda uses Python 3.x by default (unless specified otherwise). In Python 3, `print` is a function, so you need to use parentheses:\n   ```python\n   print(json.dumps(response, indent=4))\n   ```\n\n3. **Additional Notes**:\n   - Ensure that your Lambda function is using the correct runtime. If using Python 3.x, the `from urllib2 import ...` line should be updated, as `urllib2` is not available in Python 3. You might want to replace it with `urllib.request` if you decide to use it:\n     ```python\n     from urllib.request import Request, urlopen\n     from urllib.error import URLError\n     ```\n\n   - Double-check the URL in your code to make sure that the query parameters are correctly formatted. For example, `&amp;` should be replaced with `&`.\n\nBy addressing these issues, you should be able to resolve the errors you're encountering."
