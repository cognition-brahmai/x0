The current method I'm using is quite slow. Here's the code:\n\n```python\nbuf = bytes()\nfor val in floatList:\n   buf += struct.pack('f', val)\nreturn buf\n```"

        "content": "To efficiently convert a list of floats to a bytes buffer, you should avoid repeatedly concatenating bytes using the `+=` operator, as this can be very slow for large lists due to the creation of new immutable bytes objects each time. Instead, you can use a `bytearray` or the `struct` module's ability to pack multiple values at once. Here's an optimized approach using the `struct` module:\n\n```python\nimport struct\n\ndef floats_to_bytes(floatList):\n    # Create a bytes buffer using struct.pack with the correct format\n    # 'f' is the format for floating point numbers, and you can multiply it by the length of the list\n    return struct.pack(f'{len(floatList)}f', *floatList)\n\n# Example usage\nfloatList = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]  # Your list of floats\nbuf = floats_to_bytes(floatList)\n```\n\nThis method takes advantage of `struct.pack`'s ability to pack multiple floats in a single call, which is much more efficient than packing them one by one and concatenating. The format string `{len(floatList)}f` indicates that you want to pack `len(floatList)` floats. The asterisk (`*`) unpacks the list so that each float is passed as a separate argument to `struct.pack`. This should significantly improve the performance for large lists."
