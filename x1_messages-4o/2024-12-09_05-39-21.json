All PDFs are searchable but I haven't found a solution to parse it with Python and apply a script to search it without converting it to a text file first. I've looked into pypdf, pdfminer, adobe pdf documentation, and any related questions but none seemed to directly solve this issue. Is there a simple, effective method for reading PDF text, either by page, line, or the entire document? Or any other workarounds?"

        "content": "To identify the type of a document by searching through its text using Python, you can use libraries like `PyMuPDF` (also known as `fitz`), which provides an effective method to extract text from PDFs without converting them into text files first. Here's a simple way to achieve this:\n\n1. **Install PyMuPDF**:\n   Make sure you have the library installed. You can install it using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install PyMuPDF\n   ```\n\n2. **Extract Text Using PyMuPDF**:\n   You can use the following script to extract text from a PDF document. This script will allow you to read the PDF either page by page or the entire document at once.\n\n   ```python\n   import fitz  # PyMuPDF\n\n   def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):\n       # Open the PDF file\n       document = fitz.open(pdf_path)\n       \n       # Extract text from each page\n       text = \"\"\n       for page_number in range(document.page_count):\n           page = document.load_page(page_number)\n           text += page.get_text()\n       \n       return text\n\n   # Example usage\n   pdf_path = \"your_document.pdf\"\n   document_text = extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path)\n   print(document_text)\n   ```\n\n3. **Identify Document Type**:\n   Once you have the extracted text, you can apply a script to search for keywords or patterns specific to each document type (e.g., pleading, correspondence, subpoena). You can use regular expressions or simple conditional checks:\n\n   ```python\n   def identify_document_type(text):\n       if \"pleading\" in text.lower():\n           return \"Pleading\"\n       elif \"correspondence\" in text.lower():\n           return \"Correspondence\"\n       elif \"subpoena\" in text.lower():\n           return \"Subpoena\"\n       else:\n           return \"Unknown\"\n\n   document_type = identify_document_type(document_text)\n   print(f\"The document type is: {document_type}\")\n   ```\n\nThis method provides a straightforward approach to reading PDF text and identifying document types without converting PDFs to separate text files. Adjust the keyword checks based on the specific characteristics of your documents."
