Whenever I double-click on a Python script on my Windows 8 system, it runs with my old version of Python instead of Anaconda's. For instance, if my script contains `import matplotlib`, an error is thrown. I want to set things up so that I can simply double-click on a .py file and it executes with Anaconda's version of Python. How can this be achieved?"

        "content": "To configure your computer so that double-clicking on a Python script executes it using Anaconda's version of Python, you need to associate the `.py` file type with Anaconda's Python interpreter. Here's how you can achieve this on a Windows 8 system:\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide:\n\n1. **Locate Anaconda's Python Interpreter:**\n   - First, you need to find out where Anaconda's Python interpreter is located. You can do this by opening the Anaconda Prompt and typing the following command:\n     ```bash\n     where python\n     ```\n   - Note the path that is returned. It should be something like `C:\\Users\\<YourUsername>\\Anaconda3\\python.exe`.\n\n2. **Change File Association:**\n   - Open the Control Panel. You can do this by searching for \"Control Panel\" in the Start Menu.\n   - Go to \"Programs\" > \"Default Programs\" > \"Associate a file type or protocol with a program\".\n   - Scroll down to find `.py` in the list of file extensions.\n   - Select `.py`, then click on \"Change program...\".\n   - If Python is already listed, you might need to click on \"More options\" or \"Look for another app on this PC\" to manually navigate to Anaconda's Python interpreter. Use the path you found earlier to select `python.exe`.\n\n3. **Verify the Change:**\n   - After you've set the association, try double-clicking a Python script to see if it runs with Anaconda's Python.\n   - Alternatively, you can check which Python version is being used by creating a simple script, `version_check.py`, with the following content:\n     ```python\n     import sys\n     print(sys.executable)\n     print(sys.version)\n     ```\n   - Double-click the script and ensure it outputs the path and version of Anaconda's Python.\n\n4. **Update Environment Variables (Optional):**\n   - If you frequently switch between different Python environments, you might want to ensure your PATH environment variable is set correctly.\n   - Right-click on \"This PC\" or \"Computer\" on the desktop or in File Explorer, and choose \"Properties\".\n   - Click on \"Advanced system settings\" and then the \"Environment Variables\" button.\n   - In the \"System variables\" section, find the `Path` variable, select it, and click \"Edit\".\n   - Ensure that the path to Anaconda's Python (`C:\\Users\\<YourUsername>\\Anaconda3`) is listed before any other Python paths.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to set up your system to use Anaconda's Python interpreter when double-clicking on `.py` files. This should resolve the issue with incorrect Python versions being used and allow you to use packages like `matplotlib` without errors."
