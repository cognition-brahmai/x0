I was thinking about using a nested max function, but I'm having trouble implementing it. How can I find and extract the maximum value in this two-dimensional array?"

        "content": "To find the maximum value in a two-dimensional array, you can use a combination of Python's built-in `max` function and list comprehensions. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. Use a list comprehension to iterate over each sub-array (row) and find the maximum value in each row using the `max` function.\n2. Use the `max` function again to find the maximum value from the list of maximum values obtained from each row.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\narray = [\n    [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1],\n    [0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1],\n    [0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n]\n\n# Find the maximum value in each row\nmax_in_rows = [max(row) for row in array]\n\n# Find the overall maximum value from all the maximums of each row\noverall_max = max(max_in_rows)\n\nprint(\"The maximum value in the array is:\", overall_max)\n```\n\nThis code will correctly determine that the maximum value in the two-dimensional array is `4`."
