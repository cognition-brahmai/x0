The flow chart must have the following steps: Application submission, Initial screening, Phone interview, In-person interview, Background check, and Job offer or rejection. Also, the flow chart must be responsive and adjust accordingly for different screen sizes."

        "content": "To create a responsive flow chart for a job application process in an HTML page with hover effects, you can use a combination of HTML, CSS, and possibly a bit of JavaScript for responsiveness and interactivity. Here's a basic outline of how you can achieve this:\n\n### HTML Structure\n\nCreate the HTML structure for your flow chart. Use `div` elements for each step and add necessary data attributes for the detailed information.\n\n```html\n<div class=\"flowchart\">\n  <div class=\"step\" data-info=\"Submit your resume and cover letter.\">\n    Application Submission\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"step\" data-info=\"Initial evaluation of your application.\">\n    Initial Screening\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"step\" data-info=\"A phone interview with HR.\">\n    Phone Interview\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"step\" data-info=\"In-person interview with the team.\">\n    In-person Interview\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"step\" data-info=\"Background verification process.\">\n    Background Check\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"step\" data-info=\"Receive a job offer or a rejection notice.\">\n    Job Offer or Rejection\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n### CSS Styling\n\nAdd CSS to style the flow chart and implement hover effects.\n\n```css\n.flowchart {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\n  justify-content: space-around;\n  align-items: center;\n  margin: 20px;\n  padding: 20px;\n}\n\n.step {\n  position: relative;\n  padding: 20px;\n  margin: 10px;\n  border: 2px solid #007BFF;\n  border-radius: 8px;\n  background-color: #f8f9fa;\n  cursor: pointer;\n  transition: transform 0.2s;\n  flex: 1 1 20%;\n  min-width: 150px;\n  text-align: center;\n}\n\n.step:hover {\n  transform: scale(1.05);\n  background-color: #e2e6ea;\n}\n\n.step::after {\n  content: attr(data-info);\n  position: absolute;\n  bottom: 100%;\n  left: 50%;\n  transform: translateX(-50%);\n  background-color: #343a40;\n  color: #fff;\n  padding: 10px;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  white-space: nowrap;\n  opacity: 0;\n  transition: opacity 0.2s;\n  pointer-events: none;\n}\n\n.step:hover::after {\n  opacity: 1;\n}\n\n@media (max-width: 768px) {\n  .flowchart {\n    flex-direction: column;\n  }\n\n  .step {\n    flex: 1 1 100%;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### JavaScript (Optional)\n\nFor enhanced responsiveness or additional interactivity, you might consider using JavaScript or a library like jQuery. However, the above CSS should be sufficient for a basic responsive layout.\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **HTML**: Each step is represented as a `div` with a class of `step` and a `data-info` attribute containing additional information to be displayed on hover.\n  \n- **CSS**: \n  - The `.flowchart` class applies flexbox to arrange the steps in a row and wraps them if necessary.\n  - The `.step` class styles each step, adding borders, padding, and a hover effect for scaling.\n  - The `::after` pseudo-element is used to show additional information on hover. It is positioned absolutely relative to the `.step` element.\n  - Media queries ensure that the flow chart adjusts layout for smaller screen sizes.\n\nThis setup will create a responsive flow chart where each step provides additional information on hover, making it suitable for different screen sizes. Adjust styles and positions as needed to fit your design requirements."
