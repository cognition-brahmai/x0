How can I replace just the values from the 'First Season' column based on the condition?"

Here's how you can do that:\n\n```python\ndf.loc[df['First Season'] > 1990, 'First Season'] = 1\n```\n\nThis code specifies the condition `df['First Season'] > 1990` to select the rows, and then `'First Season'` to indicate that only this column should be modified. As a result, only the values in the 'First Season' column that are greater than 1990 will be replaced with 1."
