I am encountering an issue while using scrape and importing xmlrpc_client from six.moves. The error message I received is \"ImportError: cannot import name xmlrpc_client\". I attempted to resolve it by upgrading 'six' and 'scrape' using Pip, but encountered an exception during the process. The error message is as follows:\n\n```\nFound existing installation: six 1.4.1\nDEPRECATION: Uninstalling a distutils installed project (six) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

        "content": "The issue you're facing is related to the system Python installation on OS X El Capitan, which doesn't allow you to modify packages installed in the system directories due to permission and compatibility constraints. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Use a Virtual Environment**: This is the recommended way to manage Python packages without interfering with the system Python. You can create a virtual environment and install the required packages there.\n\n    ```bash\n    # Install virtualenv if not already installed\n    sudo easy_install pip\n    sudo pip install virtualenv\n\n    # Create a virtual environment\n    virtualenv venv\n\n    # Activate the virtual environment\n    source venv/bin/activate\n\n    # Now you can upgrade/install packages without affecting the system Python\n    pip install --upgrade six\n    pip install scrape\n    ```\n\n2. **Upgrade Pip**: Sometimes, upgrading pip can resolve certain issues. Within your virtual environment, you can upgrade pip by running:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install --upgrade pip\n    ```\n\n3. **Check for Compatibility**: Ensure that the versions of `six` and `scrape` you are trying to install are compatible with your Python version. You can specify a particular version if needed:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install six==1.15.0  # Example version\n    pip install scrape==your_version_here\n    ```\n\n4. **Use a Different Python Version**: If you continue to face issues, consider using a different version of Python. You can install `pyenv` to manage multiple Python versions:\n\n    ```bash\n    # Install pyenv\n    brew install pyenv\n\n    # Install a different version of Python\n    pyenv install 3.8.10\n\n    # Set the Python version for your project\n    pyenv local 3.8.10\n\n    # Create a virtual environment with this Python version\n    python -m venv venv\n    source venv/bin/activate\n\n    # Install packages\n    pip install six scrape\n    ```\n\nBy using a virtual environment and managing Python versions with `pyenv`, you can avoid conflicts with the system Python and have more control over your package dependencies."
