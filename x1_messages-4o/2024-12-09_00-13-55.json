        "content": "Creating a program that sorts sentences based on contextual dependencies involves understanding the semantic relationships between the sentences. This is a complex task typically tackled with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. In this case, we'll simulate a simplistic approach using C++ that can handle small sets of sentences by identifying dependencies manually. For a more advanced solution, you would likely need to integrate machine learning or NLP libraries that can parse and understand the context.\n\nHere's a basic C++ program that demonstrates how you might sort a vector of sentences based on given dependencies:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <string>\n#include <unordered_map>\n#include <algorithm>\n\n// Define the dependencies as pairs of indices\nstd::vector<std::pair<int, int>> dependencies = {\n    {2, 1}, // \"The bird flew over the fence.\" should come before \"The cat chased the bird.\"\n    {3, 4}, // \"The mouse ran into the hole.\" should come before \"The cat waited outside the hole.\"\n    {1, 5}  // \"The cat chased the bird.\" should come before \"The bird landed on the tree.\"\n};\n\n// Function to sort based on dependencies\nstd::vector<int> topologicalSort(const std::vector<std::pair<int, int>>& dependencies, int n) {\n    std::unordered_map<int, std::vector<int>> adjList;\n    std::vector<int> inDegree(n, 0);\n    \n    // Build adjacency list and in-degree count\n    for (const auto& dep : dependencies) {\n        adjList[dep.first].push_back(dep.second);\n        inDegree[dep.second]++;\n    }\n\n    // Find all nodes with 0 in-degree\n    std::vector<int> zeroInDegree;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\n        if (inDegree[i] == 0) {\n            zeroInDegree.push_back(i);\n        }\n    }\n\n    std::vector<int> sortedOrder;\n    while (!zeroInDegree.empty()) {\n        int node = zeroInDegree.back();\n        zeroInDegree.pop_back();\n        sortedOrder.push_back(node);\n\n        for (int neighbor : adjList[node]) {\n            inDegree[neighbor]--;\n            if (inDegree[neighbor] == 0) {\n                zeroInDegree.push_back(neighbor);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Check if topological sort is possible\n    if (sortedOrder.size() != n) {\n        throw std::runtime_error(\"The graph has a cycle!\");\n    }\n\n    return sortedOrder;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::vector<std::string> sentences = {\n        \"The bird flew over the fence.\",\n        \"The cat chased the bird.\",\n        \"The mouse ran into the hole.\",\n        \"The cat waited outside the hole.\",\n        \"The bird landed on the tree.\"\n    };\n\n    int n = sentences.size();\n    try {\n        std::vector<int> sortedIndices = topologicalSort(dependencies, n);\n\n        std::cout << \"Sorted Sentences:\\n\";\n        for (int index : sortedIndices) {\n            std::cout << sentences[index] << \"\\n\";\n        }\n    } catch (const std::exception& e) {\n        std::cerr << e.what() << \"\\n\";\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Dependencies**: We define dependencies as pairs of indices where the first sentence must come before the second.\n\n2. **Topological Sort**: The main logic revolves around using a topological sort algorithm to arrange the sentences based on their dependencies.\n\n3. **Adjacency List and In-Degree**: We build an adjacency list to represent the graph and track the in-degree of each node (sentence).\n\n4. **Sorting**: We find nodes with zero in-degree (no dependencies) and add them to the sorted order, reducing the in-degree of their neighbors iteratively.\n\n5. **Cycle Detection**: If the sorted order does not include all nodes, a cycle exists, which means the dependencies are inconsistent.\n\nThis is a simplified approach and works for small inputs where dependencies are manually defined. For handling large data sets with intricate dependencies, you would need more advanced NLP techniques integrated with machine learning models."
