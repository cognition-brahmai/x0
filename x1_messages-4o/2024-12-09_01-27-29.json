If I set `n_repeats=5` and `n_splits=3`, does that mean the validator is creating 3-folds for our estimator or model to use every fold (similar to KFold), and then repeating that process 5 times? So, would our model use a total of 5 x 3 = 15 folds?"

        "content": "Yes, that's correct. In Python, particularly when using the `scikit-learn` library, `RepeatedKFold` is a cross-validation strategy that extends `KFold` by repeating the cross-validation process multiple times. \n\nHere's how it works:\n\n- **KFold**: This is a cross-validation method that divides the dataset into `n_splits` (or `k`) consecutive folds (without shuffling by default). Each fold is then used once as a validation set while the `k-1` remaining folds form the training set.\n\n- **RepeatedKFold**: As the name suggests, it repeats the K-Fold cross-validation process several times, each time with a different randomization of the dataset. This can provide a better estimate of the model's performance by reducing the variance in the cross-validation results.\n\nWhen you set `n_repeats=5` and `n_splits=3`, it means:\n\n- The dataset is split into 3 folds.\n- The model is trained and validated 3 times per repeat.\n- This process is repeated 5 times, each time with a different random split of the data.\n\nSo, indeed, your model will be trained and validated a total of \\(5 \\times 3 = 15\\) times. This allows for a more robust estimation of the model's performance by averaging the results across different data shuffles and splits."
