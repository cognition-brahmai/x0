        "content": "Is it possible to generate a `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM TABLE` statement in SQLAlchemy without explicitly invoking the `execute()` method? When I use `session.query(table).count()`, it generates a statement like `SELECT count(*) AS count_1 FROM (SELECT table.col1 as col1, table.col2 as col2, ... from table)`, which is significantly slower in MySQL with InnoDB. I'm searching for a solution that doesn't necessitate a known primary key in the table, as suggested in the linked StackOverflow post."

        "content": "Yes, you can generate a `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM TABLE` statement in SQLAlchemy without explicitly invoking the `execute()` method by using SQLAlchemy's `func` to directly construct the `COUNT(*)` query. This allows you to bypass the subquery that is typically generated by the `session.query().count()` method. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine, func\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\nfrom your_module import YourTable  # replace with your actual table model\n\n# Set up the engine and session\nengine = create_engine('your_database_connection_string')\nSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\nsession = Session()\n\n# Directly use the func.count() to construct the query\ncount_query = session.query(func.count(YourTable.id))  # replace `YourTable.id` with any column in your table\ncount = count_query.scalar()\n\nprint(f\"Total Rows: {count}\")\n\n# Close the session when done\nsession.close()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`func.count()`**: Used to create a count expression. You can pass any column from the table to this function. If there's no primary key, you can use any column from the table (e.g., `YourTable.col1`).\n- **`scalar()`**: This method is used to execute the query and return the first column of the first row. It\u2019s a convenient way to fetch a single scalar result from a query.\n\nThis approach generates a query that looks like `SELECT COUNT(your_column) FROM your_table`, which avoids the subquery and is more efficient in cases like yours with MySQL and InnoDB."
