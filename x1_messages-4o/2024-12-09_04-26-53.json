I was reading [this paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7062-a-unified-approach-to-interpreting-model-predictions.pdf) about the `shap` package, and it provided formulas for the Shapley Values in (4) and for SHAP values in (8). However, I am still not clear on the differences between the two. From my understanding, for Shapley, I need to retrain my model on each possible subset of parameters, whereas for SHAP, I just use the basic model trained on all parameters. Is this the main difference and does this make SHAP computationally easier?"

        "content": "The concepts of Shapley values and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) are closely related, but they are applied differently in the context of interpretable machine learning.\n\n### Shapley Values\n\n- **Origin**: Shapley values come from cooperative game theory and are used to fairly distribute the payout among players based on their contribution to the total payout.\n- **Calculation**: In theory, computing Shapley values involves considering all possible subsets of features and measuring each feature's contribution across these subsets. This requires retraining the model for every possible combination of features, which is computationally expensive, especially for models with a large number of features.\n\n### SHAP Values\n\n- **Adaptation**: SHAP adapts the concept of Shapley values for model interpretation. It provides an efficient way to compute Shapley values for a given prediction, making it feasible for practical use.\n- **Efficiency**: The SHAP method leverages approximations and specific algorithmic techniques to avoid the need to retrain the model on every subset of features. Methods like Kernel SHAP, Tree SHAP, and Deep SHAP use model-specific approximations to compute Shapley values efficiently without retraining the model.\n  - **Kernel SHAP**: An approximation method that uses a linear surrogate model to estimate Shapley values.\n  - **Tree SHAP**: Optimized for tree-based models, this method exploits the tree structure to compute exact Shapley values efficiently.\n  - **Deep SHAP**: Combines DeepLIFT with Shapley values for neural networks.\n\n### Key Differences\n\n- **Computational Feasibility**: Traditional Shapley value computation is theoretically sound but computationally intensive due to the need for retraining. SHAP provides efficient algorithms that make it feasible to compute Shapley-like values for complex models.\n- **Implementation**: In practice, SHAP allows practitioners to interpret model predictions without the computational overhead of retraining, which is a significant advantage when dealing with large datasets or complex models.\n\nIn summary, SHAP provides a practical implementation of Shapley values for model interpretation, making it computationally feasible and efficient to use in real-world applications. The key difference is that SHAP uses approximations and model-specific optimizations to avoid the need for retraining the model on every subset of features, which makes it more computationally efficient."
