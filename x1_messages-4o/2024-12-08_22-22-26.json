        "content": "Certainly! To calculate the surface area of a cylindrical tank in Excel, you can use the formula for the surface area of a cylinder, which includes the lateral area and the area of the two circular ends. The formula is:\n\nSurface Area = 2\u03c0r(h + r)\n\nIn this case, you want to use the values from the table you've provided, where:\n- Radius (r) is in cell B2 (9 cm)\n- Height (h) is in cell B1 (8 cm)\n\nThe formula you can enter in cell B3 to calculate the surface area is:\n\n```\n=2*PI()*B2*(B1+B2)\n```\n\nMake sure to enter this formula in cell B3, and it will calculate the surface area of the cylindrical tank using the given measurements."
