If I remove the double quotes and use `from models.admin import *`, I then get \"ImportError: No module named admin\". Is there any way to import from a Python file that has a period in its name?"

        "content": "In Python, the period (`.`) in import statements is used to navigate through package and module hierarchies. This means that when you use `from models.admin import *`, Python expects `admin` to be a module within the `models` package.\n\nHowever, if you have named a file `models.admin.py`, Python will have trouble interpreting it as a module path due to the period in the filename. Typically, Python modules or files should not have periods in their names except for the `.py` extension. Here are a few ways to work around this issue:\n\n1. **Rename the File**: \n   - The best solution is to rename `models.admin.py` to something like `models_admin.py` or `admin_models.py`. This way, you can easily import it using `from models_admin import *` or `from admin_models import *`.\n\n2. **Use `importlib`**:\n   - If renaming is not an option, you can use Python's `importlib` to import the file dynamically. Here's how you can do it:\n\n     ```python\n     import importlib.util\n     import sys\n     import os\n\n     # Construct the path to the file\n     file_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'models.admin.py')\n\n     # Create module spec\n     spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(\"models_admin\", file_path)\n\n     # Create a new module based on the spec\n     admin_module = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)\n\n     # Execute the module\n     spec.loader.exec_module(admin_module)\n\n     # Now you can use `admin_module`\n     # For example, if you know there's a function `my_function`:\n     # admin_module.my_function()\n     ```\n\n3. **Modify PYTHONPATH**:\n   - Another less recommended approach involves modifying the `PYTHONPATH` to directly include the directory where `models.admin.py` resides, and then importing it by filename, though this can be error-prone and is generally not advisable.\n\nUltimately, the best practice is to follow Python's naming conventions and avoid using periods in filenames. This will make your code more readable and maintainable."
