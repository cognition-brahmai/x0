However, it's not working as expected. The URL points to a video, but I'm unable to retrieve it. Can anyone provide assistance? The code I'm using is as follows:\n\n```python\nr = requests.get('http://techtv.mit.edu/videos/1585-music-session-02/download.source') \nfor i in r.history:\n    print(i.url) \n```"

        "content": "The code you've written is on the right track to capture the redirect history, but there are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Check the Response Status**: Make sure that the request is actually resulting in a redirect. If the URL does not redirect, `r.history` will be empty.\n\n2. **Allow Redirects**: By default, the `requests.get` function allows redirects, so this isn't likely the issue. However, you can explicitly set this just to be sure:\n\n   ```python\n   r = requests.get('http://techtv.mit.edu/videos/1585-music-session-02/download.source', allow_redirects=True)\n   ```\n\n3. **Check Final URL**: You might also want to print the final URL after all redirects to see where you end up:\n\n   ```python\n   print(\"Final URL:\", r.url)\n   ```\n\n4. **Check Response Content**: Sometimes, the issue might be with the response itself. You can print the status code and content to see what's being returned:\n\n   ```python\n   print(\"Status Code:\", r.status_code)\n   print(\"Response Content:\", r.content)\n   ```\n\n5. **User-Agent Header**: Some servers behave differently based on the user-agent. You might want to set a user-agent to mimic a browser:\n\n   ```python\n   headers = {'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'}\n   r = requests.get('http://techtv.mit.edu/videos/1585-music-session-02/download.source', headers=headers, allow_redirects=True)\n   ```\n\nHere is a revised version of your code with these considerations:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\nurl = 'http://techtv.mit.edu/videos/1585-music-session-02/download.source'\nheaders = {'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'}\n\nr = requests.get(url, headers=headers, allow_redirects=True)\n\nfor i in r.history:\n    print(\"Redirected URL:\", i.url)\n\nprint(\"Final URL:\", r.url)\nprint(\"Status Code:\", r.status_code)\n```\n\nTry these adjustments and see if you can capture the redirect URL. If the URL still points to a video and you can't retrieve it, it might be worth checking if the server has any restrictions or if the URL is still valid."
