The program must first convert the height measurement from feet and inches to centimeters before doing the calculation. To add an extra layer of complexity, the program must also take into account the person's age and gender, with different formulas for each. The final output should be the average weight of the group, rounded to the nearest whole number. Can you crack this code?"

You can modify the `people` list to include additional data for different individuals."
