Here\u2019s a high-level guide to help you get started:\n\n1. **Define Requirements:**\n   - Determine the type of data you need to index and search.\n   - Decide on the filtering criteria (e.g., date range, categories).\n   - Define the relevance criteria (e.g., keyword matches, popularity).\n\n2. **Choose a Search Engine Technology:**\n   - Consider using existing search engines like Elasticsearch, Apache Solr, or Algolia, which provide robust search capabilities and support complex queries and filters.\n   - Alternatively, you can build a custom solution using a database with full-text search capabilities like PostgreSQL or MySQL.\n\n3. **Indexing Your Data:**\n   - Extract the data you need to search from your web application\u2019s database or other sources.\n   - Structure the data appropriately, considering fields for filtering and full-text search.\n   - Use the chosen search engine to index the data to make it searchable.\n\n4. **Implement Search Functionality:**\n   - Design the search query to include filtering options (e.g., using filters for date ranges).\n   - Ensure the search query accounts for relevance scoring to return the most relevant results.\n   - Implement pagination or limit the number of results to ensure performance within time constraints.\n\n5. **Optimize for Performance:**\n   - Use caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed search results.\n   - Optimize your data model and query logic to reduce response times.\n   - Use asynchronous processing or background jobs for indexing updates.\n\n6. **Integrate with Your Application:**\n   - Develop a search interface within your web application.\n   - Implement a user-friendly UI that allows users to specify queries and filters.\n   - Handle search requests on the server-side or client-side, depending on your architecture.\n\n7. **Testing and Tuning:**\n   - Test the search engine with different queries to ensure it performs well and returns relevant results.\n   - Tune the indexing and search parameters based on feedback and performance metrics.\n\n8. **Monitoring and Maintenance:**\n   - Monitor search performance and user satisfaction continuously.\n   - Update the indexing process and search logic as necessary to accommodate changes in data or user needs.\n\nBy following these steps, you can create a robust search engine for your web application that efficiently filters and returns relevant search results within a specified time limit."
