Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Identify the current differences between the numbers in the sequence.\n2. Ensure that each difference is a prime number.\n3. Generate the next numbers by ensuring the differences are also prime numbers.\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"math\"\n)\n\n// Function to check if a number is prime\nfunc isPrime(n int) bool {\n\tif n <= 1 {\n\t\treturn false\n\t}\n\tfor i := 2; i <= int(math.Sqrt(float64(n))); i++ {\n\t\tif n%i == 0 {\n\t\t\treturn false\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn true\n}\n\n// Function to generate the next number in the sequence\nfunc nextNumberInSequence(seq []int) int {\n\tlastNum := seq[len(seq)-1]\n\tdiff := 2 // Start with the smallest prime number\n\n\tfor {\n\t\tcandidate := lastNum + diff\n\t\tif isPrime(diff) {\n\t\t\treturn candidate\n\t\t}\n\t\tdiff++\n\t}\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Initial sequence\n\tsequence := []int{4, 9, 16, 25, 36}\n\n\t// Generate the next three numbers\n\tfor i := 0; i < 3; i++ {\n\t\tnextNum := nextNumberInSequence(sequence)\n\t\tsequence = append(sequence, nextNum)\n\t}\n\n\t// Print the full sequence\n\tfmt.Println(sequence)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Prime Check Function**: We define a function `isPrime` to check if a number is prime.\n  \n- **Next Number Calculation**: The `nextNumberInSequence` function calculates the next number in the sequence by iterating through possible differences starting from 2 (the smallest prime number) and checking if it's prime.\n\n- **Generating the Sequence**: We start with the given sequence `[4, 9, 16, 25, 36]` and use a loop to add the next three numbers by calling `nextNumberInSequence`.\n\n- **Printing the Sequence**: Finally, we print the entire sequence including the newly generated numbers.\n\nThis approach ensures that each difference between consecutive numbers is a prime number without hardcoding the next numbers."
