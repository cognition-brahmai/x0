Also, is there any comprehensive documentation on models accessible attributes because the official documentation doesn't seem to provide details on attributes like `syn0`?"

        "content": "To retrieve the weight matrices learned during the skip-gram model training using gensim's Word2Vec, you need to access specific attributes within the model. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Retrieve the `W` matrix (`syn0` in older versions):**\n   The `W` matrix represents the input-to-hidden layer weights. In gensim, this is accessible through the `wv` attribute in newer versions.\n\n   ```python\n   from gensim.models import Word2Vec\n\n   model = Word2Vec.load(\"your_model_path\")  # Load your trained model\n   W_matrix = model.wv.vectors  # This is equivalent to the old `syn0`\n   ```\n\n2. **Retrieve the `W'` matrix (`syn1` in older versions):**\n   The `W'` matrix represents the hidden-to-output layer weights. This is accessible through the `syn1` attribute in the model's `trainables` attribute.\n\n   ```python\n   W_prime_matrix = model.trainables.syn1\n   ```\n\n   Note: If you are using negative sampling, the relevant matrix would be `syn1neg`.\n\n3. **Documentation and Attributes:**\n   Gensim's official documentation might not always provide details on internal attributes like `syn0` or `syn1`, as these are considered internal implementation details. However, you can access them and understand their usage by exploring the gensim source code or using tools like `dir()` to inspect the model's attributes.\n\n   ```python\n   # Inspect available attributes\n   print(dir(model))\n   print(dir(model.wv))\n   print(dir(model.trainables))\n   ```\n\n   For comprehensive documentation, it's often helpful to look into the source code on GitHub or follow community discussions on forums like Stack Overflow to get insights into these internal structures.\n\nRemember that gensim updates might change attribute names, so always check the version compatibility and explore the attributes accordingly."
