        "content": "Let's break down this riddle step by step:\n\n1. **A prime number squared, plus four more than it:**  \n   Let's choose the smallest prime number, which is 2.  \n   \\(2^2 = 4\\).  \n   Add four more: \\(4 + 4 = 8\\).\n\n2. **Multiplied by three-sixths of the digit nine's bit:**  \n   Three-sixths is equivalent to one-half.  \n   So we multiply 8 by \\(1/2 \\times 9 = 4.5\\).  \n   \\(8 \\times 4.5 = 36\\).\n\n3. **Then take this result and add to it, the cube root of the difference between pi and fit:**  \n   Assuming \"fit\" refers to the integer 3 (as an approximation of pi),  \n   \\(\\pi - 3 \\approx 0.14159\\).  \n   The cube root of 0.14159 is approximately 0.528.\n\n   Adding this to 36 gives:  \n   \\(36 + 0.528 \\approx 36.528\\).\n\n4. **Now divide by the sum of the roots of the quad, that's formed by negative one and negative god:**  \n   Assuming \"god\" is a placeholder for some integer, let's assume it's similar to \"fit\" and use 3.  \n   The quadratic equation formed will be:  \n   \\(x^2 + x + 3 = 0\\).\n\n   The roots of this equation can be found using the quadratic formula:  \n   \\(x = \\frac{{-b \\pm \\sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{2a}\\),  \n   where \\(a = 1, b = 1, c = 3\\).\n\n   The discriminant is \\(b^2 - 4ac = 1 - 12 = -11\\),  \n   This gives complex roots, which aren't needed for a rational result.  \n   Instead, let's assume \"negative god\" implies a simple integer like -1.\n\n   So, the equation is:  \n   \\(x^2 + x - 1 = 0\\).\n\n   Solving \\(x^2 + x - 1 = 0\\) gives:  \n   Roots are \\(\\frac{{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}}{2}\\).\n\n   Sum of the roots using Vieta's formulas:  \n   \\(-\\frac{{b}}{a} = -1\\).\n\n5. **Division by this sum:**  \n   \\(36.528 / (-1) \\approx -36.528\\).\n\nThe number is rational, but not very near to a simple integer. The riddle is solved!"
