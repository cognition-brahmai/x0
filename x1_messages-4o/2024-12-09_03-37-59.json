How can I correctly obtain the maximum key in the dictionary?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that the keys in your dictionary are Unicode strings, and when you use the `max()` function on strings, it performs a lexicographical comparison rather than a numerical one. To get the maximum key based on numerical value, you need to convert the keys to integers before finding the maximum. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nMyCount = {u'10': 1, u'1': 2, u'3': 2, u'2': 2, u'5': 2, u'4': 2, u'7': 2, u'6': 2, u'9': 2, u'8': 2}\n\n# Convert keys to integers and find the maximum\nmax_key = max(MyCount, key=int)\n\nprint(max_key)  # Output will be '10'\n```\n\nIn this code, the `key=int` argument tells the `max()` function to convert each key to an integer before comparing them, ensuring that the comparison is based on numerical value rather than lexicographical order."
