I'm currently using a Python library that performs an operation on an object using a function `do_something(my_object)`. This function also prints some statistics to stdout while processing the object. Ideally, I would like the function to return this information like `out = do_something(my_object)`, but it might take some time for the developers to implement this change. As a workaround, I thought about parsing whatever `do_something(my_object)` writes to stdout. How can I capture stdout output between two points in the code, specifically, I want to implement a functionality like this:\n```\nstart_capturing()\ndo_something(my_object)\nout = end_capturing()\n```"

        "content": "To capture the `stdout` output from a Python function call, you can redirect the standard output to a string buffer using the `io` module. Here's how you can implement the `start_capturing()` and `end_capturing()` functionality:\n\n```python\nimport io\nimport sys\n\nclass OutputCapture:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self._stdout = sys.stdout\n        self._buffer = io.StringIO()\n\n    def start(self):\n        sys.stdout = self._buffer\n\n    def end(self):\n        sys.stdout = self._stdout\n        return self._buffer.getvalue()\n\n# Example usage\ndef do_something(my_object):\n    # This is where your library function would print to stdout.\n    print(f\"Processing {my_object}\")\n    print(\"Some statistics: 42\")\n\n# Create an instance of OutputCapture\ncapture = OutputCapture()\n\n# Start capturing stdout\ncapture.start()\n\n# Call the function that prints to stdout\ndo_something(\"my_object\")\n\n# End capturing and retrieve the output\nout = capture.end()\n\nprint(\"Captured output:\")\nprint(out)\n```\n\n### How This Works:\n- **OutputCapture class**: This class handles the capturing of the output.\n  - The `__init__()` method initializes the original `sys.stdout` and a new `io.StringIO` object to capture the output.\n  - The `start()` method redirects `sys.stdout` to the `StringIO` buffer.\n  - The `end()` method resets `sys.stdout` to its original state and returns the captured output from the buffer.\n\n- **Usage**: \n  - You create an instance of the `OutputCapture` class.\n  - Use the `start()` method to begin capturing.\n  - Run your function (e.g., `do_something(my_object)`).\n  - Use the `end()` method to stop capturing and retrieve the output.\n\nThis approach allows you to capture everything printed to `stdout` during the execution of `do_something` and return it as a string."
