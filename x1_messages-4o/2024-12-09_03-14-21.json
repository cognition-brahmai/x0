The code was working perfectly fine in production, but it recently started throwing an `ImportError: cannot import name 'ALREADY_HANDLED' from 'eventlet.wsgi'` on my local machine. I'm unable to find relevant solutions online. Could someone help me understand and solve this issue? Here is the error I'm seeing:\n\n```python\nError: class uri 'eventlet' invalid or not found:\nweb_1       |\nweb_1       | [Traceback (most recent call last):\nweb_1       |   File \"/root/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/gunicorn/util.py\", line 99, in load_class\nweb_1       |     mod = importlib.import_module('.'.join(components))\nweb_1       |   File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.7/importlib/__init__.py\", line 127, in import_module\nweb_1       |     return _bootstrap._gcd_import(name[level:], package, level)\nweb_1       |   File \"<frozen importlib._bootstrap>\", line 1006, in _gcd_import\nweb_1       |   File \"<frozen importlib._bootstrap>\", line 983, in _find_and_load\nweb_1       |   File \"<frozen importlib._bootstrap>\", line 967, in _find_and_load_unlocked\nweb_1       |   File \"<frozen importlib._bootstrap>\", line 677, in _load_unlocked\nweb_1       |   File \"<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>\", line 728, in exec_module\nweb_1       |   File \"<frozen importlib._bootstrap>\", line 219, in _call_with_frames_removed\nweb_1       |   File \"/root/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/gunicorn/workers/geventlet.py\", line 20, in <module>\nweb_1       |     from eventlet.wsgi import ALREADY_HANDLED as EVENTLET_ALREADY_HANDLED\nweb_1       | ImportError: cannot import name 'ALREADY_HANDLED' from 'eventlet.wsgi' (/root/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/eventlet/wsgi.py)\nweb_1       | ]\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to a change in the `eventlet` library. It appears that a recent update to `eventlet` removed or altered the `ALREADY_HANDLED` import from `eventlet.wsgi`, which your application or one of its dependencies relies on.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can take the following steps:\n\n1. **Pin the Eventlet Version**: If the recent update to `eventlet` caused the issue, you can pin the version of `eventlet` to a specific version that worked for you before. Modify your `requirements.txt` or equivalent dependency file to specify a version number, such as:\n\n   ```\n   eventlet==0.31.0\n   ```\n\n   Replace `0.31.0` with the version that was previously working for you. You can find the version you were using by checking your version control system or by looking into the Docker image that was working.\n\n2. **Check Compatibility**: If you're using a specific version of Gunicorn or any other library that depends on `eventlet`, ensure that all dependencies are compatible with each other. Sometimes, a newer version of a library may introduce breaking changes that aren't compatible with other libraries in your stack.\n\n3. **Review Change Logs**: Look at the change logs for `eventlet` to see if there's any mention of changes to `ALREADY_HANDLED`. This might give you insight into why the change was made and how you might work around it.\n\n4. **Update Your Code**: If pinning the version isn't an option, you may need to update your code or the specific components that rely on `ALREADY_HANDLED`. This might involve using a different method or handling mechanism.\n\n5. **Consult with the Eventlet Community**: If the issue persists and you need further assistance, consider reaching out to the eventlet community or checking their issue tracker on platforms like GitHub. Others might have encountered the same problem and could offer solutions.\n\n6. **Docker Image Cache**: If you're using Docker, make sure that your image isn't using a cached version of the libraries. You can force-rebuild the image without cache using:\n\n   ```shell\n   docker build --no-cache -t your-image-name .\n   ```\n\nBy addressing these steps, you should be able to resolve the `ImportError` and get your Flask application running smoothly again."
