Whenever I attempt the installation, I receive the following warning: \n\n```\nwarning: GMP or MPIR library not found; Not building Crypto.PublicKey._fastmath.  \n```\n\nIs there a way to install PyCrypto on Python 3.5 in Windows 10?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with PyCrypto is a common one, especially since PyCrypto is an older library and is no longer maintained. However, you can try the following steps to install it on Python 3.5 on Windows 10:\n\n1. **Switch to PyCryptodome**: Since PyCrypto is outdated and unmaintained, it's highly recommended to switch to PyCryptodome, which is a fork of PyCrypto and is actively maintained. It is designed to be a drop-in replacement for PyCrypto.\n\n   You can install PyCryptodome using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install pycryptodome\n   ```\n\n   Once installed, you can import it using the same namespace as PyCrypto:\n\n   ```python\n   from Crypto.Cipher import AES\n   ```\n\n2. **Install GMP/MPIR Libraries**: If you're determined to use PyCrypto, you can try installing the GMP or MPIR libraries, which are required for faster computation in some cryptographic functions.\n\n   - You can download and install the GMP library binaries for Windows. Alternatively, you can build it from source if you have a C compiler available.\n\n3. **Use Precompiled Binaries**: Sometimes, using precompiled binaries for PyCrypto can bypass the requirement for compiling it yourself.\n\n   - You can search for a Windows binary for PyCrypto for Python 3.5. Websites like [Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) often have these available.\n\n4. **Build from Source**: If you have a C compiler set up in your environment, you can try to build PyCrypto from source. You would need to download the source code and use the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   python setup.py build\n   python setup.py install\n   ```\n\n   Ensure your PATH includes the directory where your C compiler is located so that the build process can find and use it.\n\nIn conclusion, the best approach is to transition to PyCryptodome due to its active maintenance and compatibility with PyCrypto. This will help you avoid the issues associated with PyCrypto's obsolescence."
