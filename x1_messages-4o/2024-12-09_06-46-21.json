I am unsure how to correctly use `node: Node`. Should I remove the `: Node` and implement an instance check inside the function? If so, how would I be able to access `node`'s properties, which I expect to be an instance of `Node` class? Additionally, I am not familiar with how to implement type casting in Python. Can you provide some guidance?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that Python interprets the type hint `node: Node` as referring to a `Node` class that hasn't been fully defined yet. This is because the `Node` class itself isn't completely defined by the time the `append_child` method is being interpreted, leading to a circular reference issue.\n\nTo solve this problem, you can use a forward declaration by enclosing the type hint in quotes, like `'Node'`. This tells Python to treat it as a forward reference, and it will resolve the type after the class definition is complete. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.first_child = None\n        self.child_nodes = []\n\n    def append_child(self, node: 'Node'):\n        if node is not None:\n            self.first_child = node\n        self.child_nodes.append(node)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Forward Declaration**: By using `'Node'` in quotes, you allow Python to understand that you're referring to the `Node` class itself, which will be defined completely by the end of the class definition.\n  \n- **Initialize Attributes**: Ensure that you initialize `self.first_child` and `self.child_nodes` in the `__init__` method to prevent attribute errors.\n\n- **Appending to List**: Use `self.child_nodes.append(node)` instead of `self.child_nodes += [node]` for clarity and idiomatic Python.\n\n### Type Casting and Checking:\n\nIf you need to ensure that the `node` being passed is indeed an instance of the `Node` class, you can use `isinstance()` within your method:\n\n```python\ndef append_child(self, node: 'Node'):\n    if isinstance(node, Node):\n        if node is not None:\n            self.first_child = node\n        self.child_nodes.append(node)\n    else:\n        raise TypeError(\"Expected node to be of type 'Node'\")\n```\n\nThis will raise a `TypeError` if the `node` is not an instance of `Node`, providing a safeguard against incorrect usage.\n\nThis approach helps maintain clarity and correctness within your code regarding type expectations and usage."
