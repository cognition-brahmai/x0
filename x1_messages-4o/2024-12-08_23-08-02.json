        "content": "Certainly! To achieve this, we can create a JavaScript function that parses sentences and extracts relevant information, including the intended purchase of oranges and other items mentioned. We'll use regular expressions to identify and extract the quantities and items from each sentence. Here is an enhanced version of a JavaScript function that generates a comprehensive datamap:\n\n```javascript\nfunction extractData(sentence) {\n    // Regular expressions to match the parts of the sentence\n    const intendedRegex = /intending to purchase (\\d+)?\\s*(oranges?)/i;\n    const wentToBuyRegex = /went to the store to buy (\\d+)?\\s*(\\w+)/gi;\n    const couldNotFindRegex = /could not find (\\d+)?\\s*(\\w+)/gi;\n\n    // Initialize the datamap\n    let datamap = {\n        intended: [],\n        wentToBuy: [],\n        couldNotFind: []\n    };\n\n    // Extract intended purchases (oranges)\n    let intendedMatch = intendedRegex.exec(sentence);\n    if (intendedMatch) {\n        let quantity = intendedMatch[1] ? parseInt(intendedMatch[1]) : null;\n        let item = intendedMatch[2];\n        datamap.intended.push({ item, quantity });\n    }\n\n    // Extract went to buy items\n    let wentToBuyMatch;\n    while ((wentToBuyMatch = wentToBuyRegex.exec(sentence)) !== null) {\n        let quantity = wentToBuyMatch[1] ? parseInt(wentToBuyMatch[1]) : null;\n        let item = wentToBuyMatch[2];\n        datamap.wentToBuy.push({ item, quantity });\n    }\n\n    // Extract could not find items\n    let couldNotFindMatch;\n    while ((couldNotFindMatch = couldNotFindRegex.exec(sentence)) !== null) {\n        let quantity = couldNotFindMatch[1] ? parseInt(couldNotFindMatch[1]) : null;\n        let item = couldNotFindMatch[2];\n        datamap.couldNotFind.push({ item, quantity });\n    }\n\n    return datamap;\n}\n\n// Example usage with multiple sentences\nlet sentences = [\n    \"Despite intending to purchase 10 oranges, he went to the store to buy 5 apples and 3 bananas but could not find them\",\n    \"She was intending to purchase oranges, she went to buy 2 mangoes but could not find them\"\n];\n\nlet results = sentences.map(sentence => extractData(sentence));\nconsole.log(results);\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Regex Patterns**: We use regular expressions to identify specific parts of the sentences. These patterns look for phrases indicating intended purchases, items the person went to buy, and items they couldn't find.\n- **Extracting Information**: For each part, we extract both the item and its quantity. If the quantity isn't specified, it is set to `null`.\n- **Datamap Structure**: The extracted data is structured into a `datamap` object with arrays for each category (intended, wentToBuy, couldNotFind), where each entry is an object containing the item and its quantity.\n- **Multiple Sentences**: The function is designed to handle multiple sentences by mapping each sentence to its respective datamap.\n\nThis function provides a structured summary of the intent and outcomes regarding the purchase of fruits, allowing for easy analysis and further manipulation of the data."
