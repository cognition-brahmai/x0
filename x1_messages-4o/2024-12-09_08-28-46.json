I tried to follow certain suggestions, but I encountered an error that says \"expected string, float found\". The code that I am currently using is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\nwith open('combined_file.csv', 'w', newline='') as outcsv:\n    writer = csv.DictWriter(outcsv, fieldnames = [\"Date\", \"temperature 1\", \"Temperature 2\"])\n    writer.writeheader()\n\n    with open('t1.csv', 'r', newline='') as incsv:\n        reader = csv.reader(incsv)\n        writer.writerows(row + [0.0] for row in reader)\n\n    with open('t2.csv', 'r', newline='') as incsv:\n        reader = csv.reader(incsv)\n        writer.writerows(row[:1] + [0.0] + row[1:] for row in reader)\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"expected string, float found\", likely arises from the fact that the `csv.DictWriter` expects dictionaries where keys are strings corresponding to the fieldnames you've defined, but you are trying to write rows as lists, not dictionaries.\n\nTo fix this, you should ensure that the data you are writing to the CSV file aligns with the `DictWriter` expectations. Here's a modified version of your code that should work:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\n# Define the fieldnames for the header\nfieldnames = [\"Date\", \"temperature 1\", \"Temperature 2\"]\n\nwith open('combined_file.csv', 'w', newline='') as outcsv:\n    writer = csv.DictWriter(outcsv, fieldnames=fieldnames)\n    writer.writeheader()\n\n    # Process the first input CSV file\n    with open('t1.csv', 'r', newline='') as incsv:\n        reader = csv.reader(incsv)\n        for row in reader:\n            # Assuming each row in t1.csv corresponds to [\"Date\", \"temperature 1\"]\n            # Create a dictionary for each row\n            row_dict = {\n                \"Date\": row[0],  # Assuming the first column is Date\n                \"temperature 1\": row[1],  # Assuming the second column is temperature 1\n                \"Temperature 2\": 0.0  # Default value for Temperature 2\n            }\n            writer.writerow(row_dict)  # Write the row as a dictionary\n\n    # Process the second input CSV file\n    with open('t2.csv', 'r', newline='') as incsv:\n        reader = csv.reader(incsv)\n        for row in reader:\n            # Assuming each row in t2.csv corresponds to [\"Date\", \"Temperature 2\"]\n            # Create a dictionary for each row\n            row_dict = {\n                \"Date\": row[0],  # Assuming the first column is Date\n                \"temperature 1\": 0.0,  # Default value for temperature 1\n                \"Temperature 2\": row[1]  # Assuming the second column is Temperature 2\n            }\n            writer.writerow(row_dict)  # Write the row as a dictionary\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Fieldnames Consistency**: Ensure that the fieldnames in the `DictWriter` match with your data structure.\n2. **Row Conversion**: Convert each row into a dictionary before writing it with `DictWriter`.\n3. **Assumptions**: The code assumes that `t1.csv` and `t2.csv` have specific structures. If the structure is different, you will need to adjust the indexing accordingly.\n\n### Note:\n- Ensure the assumptions about the structure of the CSV files (`t1.csv` and `t2.csv`) are correct. If they have headers or a different number of columns, you'll need to adapt the logic to fit the actual structure of your data."
