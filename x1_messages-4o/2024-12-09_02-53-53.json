For example, I have a dictionary defined as `data = {'school':'DAV', 'standard': '7', 'name': 'abc', 'city': 'delhi'}` in one file, and I'm trying to pass this dictionary into a function defined in another file as `my_function(*data)`. However, this only passes the keys of the dictionary. How can I modify my function so that it receives the key-value pairs from the dictionary similar to `my_function(school='DAV', standard='7', name='abc', city='delhi')`?"

        "content": "To pass the key-value pairs of a dictionary as arguments to a function in Python, you should use the double asterisk (`**`) syntax. This syntax allows you to unpack a dictionary and pass its key-value pairs as named arguments to the function.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n1. Make sure your dictionary is defined as:\n\n   ```python\n   data = {'school': 'DAV', 'standard': '7', 'name': 'abc', 'city': 'delhi'}\n   ```\n\n2. When calling the function, use the double asterisk syntax to pass the dictionary:\n\n   ```python\n   my_function(**data)\n   ```\n\n3. Ensure your function is defined to accept named arguments. For example, in the other file, you might have:\n\n   ```python\n   def my_function(school, standard, name, city):\n       print(f\"School: {school}, Standard: {standard}, Name: {name}, City: {city}\")\n   ```\n\nWith these changes, calling `my_function(**data)` will pass the dictionary's key-value pairs as named arguments to `my_function`, allowing it to receive them correctly. This is a common technique in Python for function argument unpacking, especially useful when dealing with configurations or options stored in dictionaries."
