        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the mismatch between the number of rows in your `followers_df` and the new index you are trying to assign. The number of elements in the new index must match the number of rows in your DataFrame.\n\nIn your case, the DataFrame seems to have 20 rows, but the error suggests there might be a discrepancy somewhere. Assuming your DataFrame indeed has 20 rows, here's a straightforward way to reindex it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming your DataFrame is called followers_df\n# Reset the index to a range starting from 0\nfollowers_df = followers_df.reset_index(drop=True)\n```\n\nThe `reset_index` method will reset the index of your DataFrame to a default integer index starting from 0, and `drop=True` ensures that the old index is not added as a column in the DataFrame.\n\nBefore running this, ensure `followers_df` actually has 20 rows. You can check the number of rows by using:\n\n```python\nprint(followers_df.shape[0])\n```\n\nIf the number of rows is different from 20, adjust the range accordingly in your index assignment or verify the DataFrame content."
