Here's an example of the file:\n\n\"column1\",\"column2\", \"column3\", \"column4\", \"column5\", \"column6\"\n\"AM\", \"07\", \"1\", \"SD\", \"SD\", \"CR\"\n\"AM\", \"08\", \"1,2,3\", \"PR,SD,SD\", \"PR,SD,SD\", \"PR,SD,SD\"\n\"AM\", \"01\", \"2\", \"SD\", \"SD\", \"SD\"\n\nThere are six columns in total. However, when I try to read the file using the following code:\n\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv(file, quotechar='\"')\n\nI get the following error message: \n\nCParserError: Error tokenizing data. C error: Expected 6 fields in line 3, saw 14\n\nThis error implies that it is ignoring the double quotes and parsing every comma as a field. However, for line 3, columns 3 through 6 should be strings with commas in them. (\"1,2,3\", \"PR,SD,SD\", \"PR,SD,SD\", \"PR,SD,SD\") How can I use pandas.read_csv to parse this CSV file correctly?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that the `read_csv` function is not correctly recognizing the quoted fields as single entries, especially when there are commas inside the quoted strings. To handle this situation, you should ensure that the `quotechar` and `quoting` parameters are set correctly. You can use the `quoting` parameter from the `csv` module to handle this. Here's how you can adjust your code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport csv\n\n# Ensure you specify the correct quoting parameter\ndf = pd.read_csv(file, quotechar='\"', quoting=csv.QUOTE_ALL)\n\n# Display the dataframe\nprint(df)\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, `quoting=csv.QUOTE_ALL` ensures that pandas treats all the fields surrounded by quotes as single entries, even if they contain commas. This should correctly parse your CSV file and avoid the tokenization error.\n\nMake sure that the `file` variable is correctly set to the path of your CSV file. If you continue to experience issues, double-check that the file is being read correctly and that there are no hidden formatting issues in the CSV file itself."
