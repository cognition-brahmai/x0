For instance, if a user inputs A123, I want to be able to find any Item that has series and number like %A and 123% or %A1 and 23%. Is this possible using the Django models or with raw SQL? I would rather not construct a new column with the concatenation. My current model is as follows:\n\n```python\nclass Item(models.Model):\n    series = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n    number = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n```"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this by using the Django ORM along with the `Concat` function and `Value` from `django.db.models`. The `Concat` function allows you to concatenate fields and then filter based on the combined result. Here's how you can do it:\n\nFirst, import the necessary functions:\n\n```python\nfrom django.db.models import Value\nfrom django.db.models.functions import Concat\nfrom django.db.models import Q\n```\n\nThen, you can filter the `Item` model using a query like this:\n\n```python\nfrom yourapp.models import Item\n\ndef filter_items(user_input):\n    # Split the user input into two parts if you have a specific pattern like A123\n    # This is a simple example, you might need a more robust splitting logic depending on your needs\n    part1 = user_input[:1]  # 'A'\n    part2 = user_input[1:]  # '123'\n\n    # Use Concat to concatenate series and number and then filter\n    items = Item.objects.annotate(\n        concatenated=Concat('series', 'number')\n    ).filter(\n        Q(concatenated__icontains=user_input) |\n        Q(series__icontains=part1, number__icontains=part2) |\n        Q(series__icontains=part1 + part2[0], number__icontains=part2[1:])\n    )\n\n    return items\n```\n\nIn this example, the `filter_items` function splits the `user_input` into parts and performs filtering to match the concatenated string as well as other conditions you described.\n\nThis method avoids creating a new column in the database and makes use of Django's ORM capabilities. If your database supports it, this approach should be both efficient and effective."
