Here's how you can do it for your `foo.txt` file:\n\n```bash\nsed -i '$d' foo.txt\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `sed` is a stream editor that is used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream.\n- `-i` option edits the file in place, meaning it will directly modify `foo.txt`.\n- `'$d'` tells `sed` to delete the last line (`$` represents the last line, and `d` is the delete command).\n\nAfter running this command, `foo.txt` will contain:\n\n```\na\nb\n```"
