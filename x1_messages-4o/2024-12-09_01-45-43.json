I get the following error: 'TypeError: sequence index must be integer, not 'slice''. Here's a simple REPL that illustrates the issue:\n\n```python\n>>> import collections\n>>> d = collections.deque()\n>>> for i in range(3):\n...     d.append(i)\n...\n>>> d\ndeque([0, 1, 2])\n>>> d[2:]\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nTypeError: sequence index must be integer, not 'slice'\n```\nIs there a workaround to support slicing into deques in Python?"

        "content": "The `collections.deque` in Python does not support slicing directly, as you discovered. This is because deques are optimized for fast appends and pops from both ends and do not support random access and slicing like lists.\n\nHowever, you can work around this limitation by converting the `deque` to a `list` when you need to perform slicing. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\n# Create a deque and populate it\nd = collections.deque()\nfor i in range(3):\n    d.append(i)\n\n# Convert the deque to a list for slicing\nsliced_part = list(d)[2:]\n\nprint(sliced_part)  # Output: [2]\n```\n\nBy converting the `deque` to a list, you can use all the list features, including slicing. Keep in mind that this conversion comes with some overhead, so if slicing is a frequent operation in your application, you might want to reconsider whether using a `deque` is appropriate in this context."
