For example, in the following code, the function \"is-even\" results in a syntax error while \"is_even\" works as expected. I have noticed that languages like Lisp and Clojure allow the use of hyphens in function and variable names. What could be the reason Python doesn't allow the same?\n\n```python\n# This won't work -- SyntaxError\ndef is-even(num):\n    return num % 2\n\n# This will work\ndef is_even(num):\n    return num % 2\n```\nI am unable to find an answer to this online, could anyone provide an explanation?"

        "content": "Python's syntax design choices, including the disallowance of hyphens in identifiers such as function and variable names, are largely influenced by readability and consistency. Here are some reasons for this decision:\n\n1. **Operator Confusion**: In Python, the hyphen (`-`) is used as a subtraction operator. Allowing hyphens in identifiers could lead to ambiguity and confusion in parsing the code. For instance, `is-even` could be mistakenly interpreted as `is` minus `even`, rather than a single identifier.\n\n2. **Syntax Clarity**: By restricting identifiers to use underscores (`_`) instead of hyphens, Python maintains a clear and consistent syntax. Underscores provide a clear visual separation without conflicting with any operators, which preserves readability.\n\n3. **Readability and Conventions**: Python emphasizes readability and has established conventions like \"snake_case\" for variable and function names, which use underscores to separate words. This is part of the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP 8) style guide, which encourages consistency and clarity in code.\n\n4. **Consistency Across Languages**: Many programming languages that are similar to Python, such as C, C++, and Java, also disallow hyphens in identifiers. This consistency helps developers transition between languages more easily.\n\n5. **Historical Context**: Python's syntax and design decisions were influenced by languages like C and ABC, both of which do not allow hyphens in identifiers. These historical influences have shaped Python's development and syntax rules.\n\nIn contrast, languages like Lisp and Clojure have different syntax rules and parsing mechanisms that accommodate hyphens in identifiers without causing ambiguity. These languages were designed with different paradigms and goals, which is why they allow syntax that Python does not."
