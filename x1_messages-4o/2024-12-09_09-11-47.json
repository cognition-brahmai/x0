        "content": "Adding two matrices of different sizes directly is not defined in standard matrix arithmetic. However, if you want to add two matrices of different sizes, you have to decide how you want to handle the size mismatch. Here are a few possible approaches:\n\n1. **Padding with Zeros:** You can pad the smaller matrix with zeros to match the size of the larger matrix, and then add them.\n\n2. **Cropping:** You can crop the larger matrix to the size of the smaller matrix and then perform the addition.\n\n3. **Returning an Error:** You can choose to return an error or a message indicating that the matrices are of different sizes and cannot be added directly.\n\nHere's a Python function implementing the padding with zeros approach:\n\n```python\ndef add_matrices(mat1, mat2):\n    # Determine the size of the result matrix\n    rows = max(len(mat1), len(mat2))\n    cols = max(len(mat1[0]), len(mat2[0]))\n\n    # Initialize the result matrix with zeros\n    result = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]\n\n    # Add the elements of the first matrix\n    for i in range(len(mat1)):\n        for j in range(len(mat1[0])):\n            result[i][j] += mat1[i][j]\n\n    # Add the elements of the second matrix\n    for i in range(len(mat2)):\n        for j in range(len(mat2[0])):\n            result[i][j] += mat2[i][j]\n\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nmat1 = [\n    [1, 2],\n    [3, 4]\n]\n\nmat2 = [\n    [5, 6, 7],\n    [8, 9, 10],\n    [11, 12, 13]\n]\n\nresult = add_matrices(mat1, mat2)\nfor row in result:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis code pads the smaller matrix with zeros to match the size of the larger matrix. If you choose a different approach, you can modify the function accordingly."
