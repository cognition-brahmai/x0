I've noticed that the \"~\" operator seems to work fine, but I haven't found it in any numpy reference manual. Also, it does not seem to work with scalars. For instance, if I try to use \"bool(~True)\", it returns \"True\". Can you help me understand this?"

        "content": "Yes, you can use the `~` operator to invert a NumPy array of booleans, and this is a common practice among NumPy users. The `~` operator is a bitwise NOT operator, and when applied to boolean arrays, it effectively inverts the boolean values (i.e., it turns `True` to `False` and vice versa).\n\nHere's how it works with a NumPy array:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nbool_array = np.array([True, False, True, False])\ninverted_array = ~bool_array\n\nprint(inverted_array)\n# Output: [False  True False  True]\n```\n\nThe reason why the `~` operator works with NumPy boolean arrays is that NumPy arrays support element-wise operations, and the `~` operator is applied element-wise to each element in the array. Under the hood, NumPy treats booleans as integers (`True` as 1 and `False` as 0), and the bitwise NOT operation flips the bits, resulting in the inversion of boolean values.\n\nHowever, when you use the `~` operator on a Python boolean scalar (like `~True`), it doesn't behave the same way. This is because Python's native booleans are not designed to support bitwise operations directly. The `~` operator is applied to the integer representation of the boolean, which results in:\n\n- `~True` (which is `~1`) results in `-2`\n- `~False` (which is `~0`) results in `-1`\n\nWhen you convert these results back to boolean using `bool()`, they are both considered `True` because any non-zero integer is `True` in Python.\n\nIn summary, using `~` with NumPy boolean arrays is a convenient and efficient way to invert them, but it doesn't work the same way with native Python boolean scalars due to the underlying integer representation and how the `bool()` function interprets non-zero integers."
