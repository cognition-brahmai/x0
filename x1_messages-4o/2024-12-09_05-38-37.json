However, when I check the version of Matplotlib, it shows '1.1.1', which is very outdated and none of my programs run with it. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling Matplotlib but the version remains the same. I've also tried reinstalling python 2.7 with scipy, numpy, and matplotlib through macports but still have the same issue. Is there a way I can manually delete all python libraries, even python itself, and restart from scratch? Also, could some things be installing to opt/local/bin when they need to be installed to usr/local/bin? \n\nAdditionally, I'm getting outdated versions for scipy and numpy as well. Is there a way to delete everything that is connected to python and restart?"

        "content": "It sounds like you're dealing with a complex Python environment issue on your Mac. Here's a step-by-step approach to help you clean up your Python installation and start fresh:\n\n### Step 1: Uninstall Existing Python Packages\n\n1. **Uninstall Matplotlib, NumPy, and SciPy:**\n   - Use `pip` to uninstall each package. You might need to use `pip2` if you're using Python 2.7:\n     ```bash\n     pip uninstall matplotlib numpy scipy\n     ```\n\n2. **Locate and Remove Python Packages:**\n   - Check common library locations and manually remove any lingering packages:\n     ```bash\n     rm -rf /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/matplotlib*\n     rm -rf /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/numpy*\n     rm -rf /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/scipy*\n     ```\n\n### Step 2: Uninstall Python\n\n1. **Uninstall Python via Homebrew:**\n   - If Python is installed via Homebrew, you can uninstall it:\n     ```bash\n     brew uninstall python\n     ```\n\n2. **Remove MacPorts Python:**\n   - If you've installed Python through MacPorts, you can uninstall it:\n     ```bash\n     sudo port uninstall python27\n     sudo port uninstall python38  # Replace with your versions\n     ```\n\n3. **Remove Python Frameworks:**\n   - Delete the Python frameworks if they still exist:\n     ```bash\n     sudo rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework\n     ```\n\n### Step 3: Clean Up Environment Variables\n\n1. **Check Your PATH:**\n   - Ensure your PATH environment variable is not pointing to unwanted Python binaries:\n     ```bash\n     echo $PATH\n     ```\n\n2. **Edit Shell Configuration:**\n   - Open your shell configuration file (like `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zshrc`) and remove any unwanted Python paths:\n     ```bash\n     nano ~/.bashrc\n     ```\n   - Remove or comment out lines pointing to `/opt/local/bin` or any other incorrect Python paths.\n\n### Step 4: Reinstall Python\n\n1. **Install Python via Homebrew:**\n   - Homebrew is a good option for managing Python versions:\n     ```bash\n     brew install python\n     ```\n\n2. **Use Virtual Environments:**\n   - It's a good practice to use virtual environments to manage dependencies:\n     ```bash\n     python3 -m venv myenv\n     source myenv/bin/activate\n     ```\n\n3. **Reinstall Packages in Virtual Environment:**\n   - Once inside the virtual environment, reinstall your packages:\n     ```bash\n     pip install numpy scipy matplotlib\n     ```\n\n### Step 5: Verify Installation\n\n1. **Check Versions:**\n   - Verify that you have the correct versions installed:\n     ```bash\n     python -c \"import numpy; print(numpy.__version__)\"\n     python -c \"import scipy; print(scipy.__version__)\"\n     python -c \"import matplotlib; print(matplotlib.__version__)\"\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to clean up your Python environment and start fresh. Virtual environments are highly recommended as they help isolate project-specific dependencies and avoid conflicts with global installations."
