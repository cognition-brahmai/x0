However, I'm encountering a `LookupError: unknown encoding: cp65001`. The same command seems to work fine with Python 3, and I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling both Python and pip, but haven't had any success. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The `LookupError: unknown encoding: cp65001` error occurs because Python 2.7 doesn't handle the `cp65001` encoding (which corresponds to UTF-8) very well on some Windows systems. This is particularly common when the Windows command prompt is set to use UTF-8 encoding, which is what `cp65001` represents.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Change the Command Prompt Encoding**:\n   You can change the code page in the command prompt to a more compatible one, such as `cp1252`, by running the following command before executing your `pip --version` command:\n   ```sh\n   chcp 1252\n   ```\n\n2. **Set the PYTHONIOENCODING Environment Variable**:\n   Set the `PYTHONIOENCODING` environment variable to a compatible encoding like `utf-8`. This can be done temporarily in the command prompt or permanently in the system settings.\n   \n   **Temporarily:**\n   ```sh\n   set PYTHONIOENCODING=UTF-8\n   ```\n   \n   **Permanently:**\n   - Right-click on \"Computer\" or \"This PC\" and select \"Properties\".\n   - Click \"Advanced system settings\".\n   - Go to the \"Environment Variables\" section.\n   - Under \"System variables\" or \"User variables\", click \"New\" and add:\n     - Variable name: `PYTHONIOENCODING`\n     - Variable value: `utf-8`\n\n3. **Modify `site.py`**:\n   If the above solutions do not work, you can modify the `site.py` file in your Python installation directory to handle this encoding issue. Locate the `site.py` file, and add the following lines at the beginning:\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   sys.setdefaultencoding('utf-8')\n   ```\n\n4. **Use a Python Wrapper**:\n   Consider using a Python wrapper like `win-unicode-console`, which can help deal with Unicode issues in Windows console applications. You can install it via pip using Python 3, and then run your scripts with it:\n   ```sh\n   pip install win-unicode-console\n   python -m run your_script.py\n   ```\n\nTry these steps, and one of them should help you resolve the encoding issue with pip on Python 2.7. If possible, consider migrating your scripts to Python 3, as Python 2 is no longer supported and has better support for Unicode and encoding issues."
