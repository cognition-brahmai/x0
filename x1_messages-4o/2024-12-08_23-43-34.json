        "content": "To categorize the movie genre of \"The Shawshank Redemption\" and identify recurring themes or motifs, we can use a combination of data structures to store information about the movie and some basic logic to categorize it. Here's a simple implementation using Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the movie data\nmovie_title = \"The Shawshank Redemption\"\ndirector = \"Frank Darabont\"\nlead_actors = [\"Tim Robbins\", \"Morgan Freeman\"]\ngenres = [\"Drama\", \"Crime\"]\nthemes_motifs = [\n    \"Hope\",\n    \"Friendship\",\n    \"Redemption\",\n    \"Freedom\",\n    \"Institutionalization\"\n]\n\n# Function to categorize the movie based on director and lead actors\ndef categorize_movie(director, lead_actors):\n    # Simple logic for categorization\n    if director == \"Frank Darabont\" and \"Tim Robbins\" in lead_actors and \"Morgan Freeman\" in lead_actors:\n        return genres\n    else:\n        return [\"Unknown\"]\n\n# Function to identify recurring themes/motifs\ndef identify_themes():\n    return themes_motifs\n\n# Categorize the movie\nmovie_genres = categorize_movie(director, lead_actors)\nprint(f\"The genres of '{movie_title}' are: {', '.join(movie_genres)}\")\n\n# Identify recurring themes/motifs\nmovie_themes = identify_themes()\nprint(f\"Recurring themes/motifs in '{movie_title}' are: {', '.join(movie_themes)}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Movie Data:** The movie's title, director, lead actors, genres, and themes/motifs are stored in variables and lists.\n2. **Categorization Function:** A function `categorize_movie` is defined to match the director and lead actors with predefined conditions to return the movie's genres.\n3. **Themes Function:** Another function `identify_themes` returns the list of recurring themes or motifs in the movie.\n4. **Output:** The code prints out the genres and themes/motifs of \"The Shawshank Redemption.\"\n\nThis code is a simple representation and can be expanded with more complex logic or data sources for more dynamic applications."
