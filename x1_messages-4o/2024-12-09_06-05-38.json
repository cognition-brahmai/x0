        "content": "The \"Event loop is closed\" error can sometimes occur due to the way the event loop is being managed, especially in older versions of Python like 3.5.3. Here are a few strategies you can use to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Proper Closing of the Event Loop:**\n   Make sure that `loop.close()` is not being called prematurely. In some environments, like Jupyter Notebooks or certain IDEs, the event loop may be closed automatically, leading to this error. You can try removing the `loop.close()` line to see if the issue persists.\n\n2. **Use asyncio.run() (for Python 3.7+):**\n   Although your version of Python does not support `asyncio.run()`, upgrading to Python 3.7 or later is recommended if possible. This function simplifies the running of asyncio programs by managing the event loop for you. If you upgrade, your code can be rewritten as follows:\n\n   ```python\n   import asyncio\n\n   async def hello_world():\n       print(\"Hello World!\")\n\n   asyncio.run(hello_world())\n   ```\n\n3. **Explicitly Create a New Event Loop:**\n   If upgrading is not an option, you can explicitly create a new event loop when the existing one is closed. You can modify your code slightly to ensure a fresh loop is created:\n\n   ```python\n   import asyncio\n\n   async def hello_world():\n       print(\"Hello World!\")\n\n   try:\n       loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n       loop.run_until_complete(hello_world())\n   finally:\n       loop.close()\n   ```\n\n   If you encounter an error stating that the loop is closed, you can replace the `get_event_loop()` line with:\n\n   ```python\n   loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()\n   asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)\n   ```\n\n   This ensures that you're working with a new and open event loop.\n\n4. **Environment Considerations:**\n   If the issue persists, consider the environment in which you're running the code. Some interactive environments or scripts that are run multiple times can interfere with the event loop's state. Running the script from a fresh terminal or console might help.\n\nTry these solutions and see which one resolves the error in your setup."
