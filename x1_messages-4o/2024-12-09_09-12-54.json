        "content": "Certainly! Here's a Ruby method that compares two strings and returns the number of characters that are different between them:\n\n```ruby\ndef count_differences(str1, str2)\n  # Ensure both strings are of equal length by padding with spaces if necessary\n  max_length = [str1.length, str2.length].max\n  str1 = str1.ljust(max_length)\n  str2 = str2.ljust(max_length)\n  \n  # Count the number of differing characters\n  differences = 0\n  (0...max_length).each do |i|\n    differences += 1 if str1[i] != str2[i]\n  end\n  \n  differences\nend\n\n# Example usage:\nstring1 = \"hello\"\nstring2 = \"hallo\"\nputs count_differences(string1, string2)  # Output: 1\n```\n\nThis method first ensures that both strings are of the same length by padding the shorter one with spaces. Then, it iterates through each character in the strings, comparing them and counting the differences. Finally, it returns the total count of differing characters. You can test this method with different string inputs to see how it works."
