My issue is that after printing the colorized text, I'm not able to turn off the color and the color remains even after my program ends. How can I read the current escape sequence and restore the default color after printing my colorized text? I'm working on a Red Hat 5.x system, using Bash and Python 2.3."

        "content": "To solve the issue of restoring the default color after printing colorized text in your terminal, you need to ensure that you reset the terminal's color settings after printing colored text. This can be done by using the appropriate escape sequences.\n\nHere's a simple example of how you can modify your `pprint` function to achieve this:\n\n```python\nclass ColorPrinter:\n    # Define color escape sequences\n    COLORS = {\n        'red': '\\033[31m',\n        'green': '\\033[32m',\n        'yellow': '\\033[33m',\n        'blue': '\\033[34m',\n        # Add more colors if needed\n    }\n    RESET = '\\033[0m'  # Reset escape sequence\n\n    def pprint(self, msg, color):\n        # Get the escape sequence for the specified color\n        color_escape = self.COLORS.get(color, self.RESET)\n        # Print the message with the color and then reset the color\n        print(f\"{color_escape}{msg}{self.RESET}\")\n\n# Usage example\nprinter = ColorPrinter()\nprinter.pprint(\"This is a red message\", \"red\")\nprinter.pprint(\"This is a green message\", \"green\")\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n- We define a dictionary `COLORS` that maps color names to their respective ANSI escape sequences.\n- We use `\\033[0m` as the reset escape sequence, which resets all attributes, including color, to their defaults.\n- In the `pprint` method, we retrieve the appropriate escape sequence for the desired color and append the reset sequence at the end of the message to ensure that the terminal returns to its default settings.\n\nWhen you print using this method, the terminal color should automatically reset after each message, and you shouldn't experience lingering color settings."
