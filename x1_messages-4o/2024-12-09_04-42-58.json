According to the official documentation, it seems I can only make a join between fields having the same name. How can I perform a join operation equivalent to the following SQL statement?\n\n```SQL\nSELECT *\nFROM df1\nLEFT OUTER JOIN df2\n  ON df1.id_key = df2.fk_key\n```"

        "content": "Yes, you can join two DataFrames in Pandas on fields with different names using the `merge()` function. You can specify the column names from each DataFrame that you want to join on using the `left_on` and `right_on` parameters. Here's how you can perform a left outer join equivalent to the SQL statement you provided:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrames\ndf1 = pd.DataFrame({\n    'id_key': [1, 2, 3],\n    'value1': ['A', 'B', 'C']\n})\n\ndf2 = pd.DataFrame({\n    'fk_key': [2, 3, 4],\n    'value2': ['D', 'E', 'F']\n})\n\n# Performing the left outer join\nresult = pd.merge(df1, df2, how='left', left_on='id_key', right_on='fk_key')\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nIn this example, `df1` and `df2` are joined on `df1.id_key` and `df2.fk_key` using a left outer join. The `how='left'` parameter specifies that it's a left join. The resulting DataFrame will include all rows from `df1` and the matching rows from `df2`, with `NaN` values where there is no match."
