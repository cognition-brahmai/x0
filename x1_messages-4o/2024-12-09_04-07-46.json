According to the Python documentation, this should be possible using `set.remove(elem)` or `set.discard(elem)`. However, when I try to use these methods with a set as an argument, I get a KeyError. I expect to get a set that excludes the elements from the second set. I know I can accomplish this with `a.difference(b)` or `set.difference_update(other)`, but I'm wondering if this is a documentation error or if `set.remove(elem)` and `set.discard(elem)` can't actually take a set as an argument. Here's the code I'm using:\n\n```\nPython 2.7.2 (default, Jun 12 2011, 14:24:46) [M...\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\"\n>>> a = set(range(10))\n>>> b = set(range(5,10))\n>>> a\nset([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])\n>>> b\nset([8, 9, 5, 6, 7])\n>>> a.remove(b)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nKeyError: set([8, 9, 5, 6, 7])\n>>> a.discard(b)\n>>> a\nset([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])\n```\nI expect the result to be `set([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])`. Can anyone help me understand what I'm doing wrong?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to a misunderstanding of how the `set.remove()` and `set.discard()` methods work. These methods are designed to remove a single element from a set, not another set. When you pass a set (like `b`) as an argument, Python tries to interpret it as a single element to remove, which is why you're getting a `KeyError`.\n\nTo remove elements of one set that are present in another set, you should use the `difference` or `difference_update` methods, as they are specifically designed for this purpose. Here's how you can achieve what you're expecting:\n\n```python\n# Initialize the sets\na = set(range(10))\nb = set(range(5, 10))\n\n# Use difference to create a new set\nresult = a.difference(b)\nprint(result)  # Output: set([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])\n\n# Or use difference_update to modify the original set\na.difference_update(b)\nprint(a)  # Output: set([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])\n```\n\nThe `difference` method returns a new set with elements that are in `a` but not in `b`, while `difference_update` modifies the original set `a` to exclude elements that are present in `b`.\n\nRemember that `set.remove(elem)` and `set.discard(elem)` are for individual elements, not for entire sets."
