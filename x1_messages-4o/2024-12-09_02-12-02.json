Previously, the execution of the following Python code within Visual Studio Code would not generate any exceptions:\n\n```python\n# Import exit from sys\nfrom sys import exit as sys_exit\n# Exit to system with errorlevel set to 1\nsys_exit(1)\n# Next instruction is never executed.\n# Executing the script directly from the terminal in Windows sets the\n# errorlevel to 1 and the script execution is terminated. \nprint('unreachable code')\n```\n\nHowever, with the latest versions, when the `sys_exit(1)` instruction is executed, it results in a SystemExit exception. Is there a way to disable this behavior and return to the previous one?"

        "content": "The behavior you're experiencing is due to how Visual Studio Code's integrated terminal handles the `SystemExit` exception. In your earlier setup, it seems the exit was being handled more like a direct script execution in a terminal, whereas now, the environment is explicitly catching the `SystemExit` exception.\n\nTo manage this behavior and achieve the desired effect where the script exits without showing the exception, you can modify your code to handle the `SystemExit` exception. Here's a way to handle it gracefully:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Import exit from sys\n    from sys import exit as sys_exit\n    # Exit to system with errorlevel set to 1\n    sys_exit(1)\nexcept SystemExit as e:\n    # Handle the exception and exit with the same error code\n    sys_exit(e.code)\n\n# This line will not be executed\nprint('unreachable code')\n```\n\nIn this setup, you directly handle the `SystemExit` exception and re-raise it using the same exit code. This should bypass the exception message in the Visual Studio Code terminal, emulating the previous behavior more closely.\n\nAdditionally, you might want to check the settings in your Python extension or VS Code to see if there are any configurations related to exception handling that can be adjusted. However, such settings are typically more focused on debugging rather than altering fundamental exception handling in the execution environment."
