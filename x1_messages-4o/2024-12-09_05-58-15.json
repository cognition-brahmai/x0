        "content": "The error message \"no kernel image is available for execution on the device\" indicates that the compiled CUDA code is not compatible with your Quadro 6000 GPU. This usually happens when the compute capability of the GPU is not supported by the CUDA code you compiled.\n\nThe Quadro 6000 has a compute capability of 2.0 (Fermi architecture), and CUDA 9.0 should support it. However, it is possible that the default architecture set during the compilation doesn't include compute capability 2.0.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to explicitly specify the architecture for which you want to compile the CUDA code. You can do this by using the `-arch` flag with `nvcc`. Here's how you can modify your compilation command:\n\n```bash\nnvcc -arch=sm_20 -o sapx simples_cuda.cu\n```\n\nThis command specifies that the CUDA code should be compiled for devices with compute capability 2.0.\n\nIf you continue to face issues, you might want to check:\n\n1. **CUDA Version Compatibility**: Ensure that CUDA 9.0 is properly installed and compatible with your GPU. Although CUDA 9.0 should support Fermi architecture, check if there are any specific configurations needed.\n\n2. **Driver Update**: Ensure that your NVIDIA driver is up to date and supports the CUDA version you are using.\n\n3. **Device Query**: You can run a CUDA device query sample to check if the system recognizes the GPU correctly.\n\nIf the above steps do not resolve the issue, consider trying a different CUDA toolkit version (if possible) that explicitly supports the Quadro 6000 and its architecture."
