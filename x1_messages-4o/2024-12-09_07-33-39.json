        "content": "To extract the third row of a pandas DataFrame and store it as a separate DataFrame with the desired shape, you can use the `iloc` method. Here's how you can accomplish that:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming X_test is your dataframe\nX_test = pd.DataFrame({\n    'BoxRatio': [-0.163, 0.000, 0.417, 0.054],\n    'Thrust': [-0.817, 0.000, -0.298, -0.574],\n    'Velocity': [0.741, 0.732, 2.036, 1.323],\n    'OnBalRun': [1.702, 1.798, 4.107, 2.553],\n    'vwapGain': [0.218, 0.307, 1.793, 1.185]\n}, index=[5, 8, 11, 13])\n\n# Extract the third row and store it in a new DataFrame\nrow3 = X_test.iloc[[2]]  # iloc[2] for the third row (0-based index)\n\nprint(row3)\nprint(\"Shape of row3:\", row3.shape)\n```\n\nThis code will create a new DataFrame `row3` containing only the third row of `X_test`, and its shape will be `(1, 5)`. The `iloc` method with `[[2]]` ensures that the result is a DataFrame, not a Series, thus maintaining the shape `(1, 5)`."
