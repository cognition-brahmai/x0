        "content": "Integrating stored procedures with Django's ORM can be a practical approach when you need to perform complex queries or operations that are beyond the capabilities of Django's ORM. Here's how you can accomplish this integration:\n\n### Supported RDBMS\nDjango supports several relational database management systems (RDBMS), including:\n\n- **PostgreSQL**\n- **MySQL**\n- **SQLite**\n- **Oracle**\n\nEach of these databases supports stored procedures, but the implementation details can vary slightly. Here's a general approach:\n\n### Steps to Integrate Stored Procedures\n\n1. **Define the Stored Procedure:**\n   First, create and define your stored procedure in the database. This will depend on the specific SQL dialect of your RDBMS.\n\n   For example, in PostgreSQL:\n\n   ```sql\n   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION my_stored_procedure(param1 INTEGER)\n   RETURNS TABLE(column1 INTEGER, column2 VARCHAR) AS $$\n   BEGIN\n       RETURN QUERY\n       SELECT column1, column2 FROM my_table WHERE id = param1;\n   END;\n   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n   ```\n\n2. **Accessing Stored Procedures via Django:**\n   You'll need to execute raw SQL through Django's ORM to call stored procedures. You can use Django's `connection` object to run raw SQL.\n\n   Here's an example using PostgreSQL:\n\n   ```python\n   from django.db import connection\n\n   def call_my_stored_procedure(param1):\n       with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n           cursor.callproc('my_stored_procedure', [param1])\n           results = cursor.fetchall()\n       return results\n   ```\n\n   In this example, `callproc()` is used to call the stored procedure, and `fetchall()` retrieves the results.\n\n3. **Handle Transactions:**\n   Ensure that your stored procedures are properly handling transactions if they are modifying data. Django's transaction management will not automatically encompass raw SQL executions unless you explicitly manage them.\n\n   You can manage transactions using Django's `transaction` module:\n\n   ```python\n   from django.db import transaction\n\n   @transaction.atomic\n   def call_my_stored_procedure(param1):\n       # Your logic here\n       pass\n   ```\n\n4. **Return Results:**\n   Process and return the results as needed. The results will typically be a list of tuples, which you can convert into a more convenient format if necessary.\n\n### Considerations\n\n- **Security:** Ensure that any user inputs are properly sanitized to prevent SQL injection attacks.\n- **Performance:** Stored procedures can offer performance benefits, but always test and profile to ensure they meet your needs.\n- **Maintenance:** Remember that stored procedures are maintained outside of your Django application, which can add complexity to your deployment and version control processes.\n\nUsing stored procedures can be a powerful tool in your Django application, especially when dealing with complex queries or database-intensive operations. Make sure to test thoroughly in your development environment before deploying to production."
