        "content": "The error message you're encountering is related to permission issues with the MySQL server. Here's a breakdown of the error and how you might resolve it:\n\n### Error Analysis\n1. **Error 1018 (HY000): Can't read dir of '.' (errno: 13)**:\n   - This error usually indicates a permission problem where the MySQL server doesn't have the necessary permissions to read the directory where the databases are stored.\n\n2. **(2002, \"Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket '/var/lib/mysql/my_database' (13)\")**:\n   - This error suggests that there is an issue with the MySQL socket file. Errno 13 indicates a permissions problem. The MySQL server can't access the socket file due to insufficient permissions.\n\n### Possible Solutions\n1. **Check MySQL Directory Permissions**:\n   - Ensure that the MySQL data directory (often `/var/lib/mysql`) has the correct permissions and ownership. The MySQL user should have the necessary permissions to access this directory.\n   ```bash\n   sudo chown -R mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql\n   sudo chmod -R 755 /var/lib/mysql\n   ```\n\n2. **Check AppArmor or SELinux**:\n   - If you're on a system that uses AppArmor or SELinux, these security modules may restrict MySQL's access to certain directories. Check the logs for any AppArmor or SELinux denials and adjust the security policies accordingly.\n   - For AppArmor:\n     ```bash\n     sudo aa-status\n     sudo aa-complain /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld\n     ```\n   - For SELinux:\n     ```bash\n     sudo setenforce 0  # Temporarily disable SELinux to check if it's causing the issue\n     ```\n\n3. **Verify MySQL Configuration**:\n   - Ensure that your MySQL configuration file (`my.cnf`) is correctly set up and that the `socket` entry points to the correct location.\n\n4. **MySQL Service Status**:\n   - Ensure that the MySQL service is running. You can check the status with:\n   ```bash\n   sudo systemctl status mysql\n   ```\n   - Restart the service if necessary:\n   ```bash\n   sudo systemctl restart mysql\n   ```\n\n5. **Check for MySQL Logs**:\n   - Review the MySQL error log, typically located at `/var/log/mysql/error.log`, for any additional error messages that could provide more insight into the problem.\n\n6. **Django Configuration**:\n   - Double-check your Django settings file to ensure that the `HOST` and `PORT` are correctly configured. If MySQL is on the same server, `HOST` can be set to `'localhost'`.\n\nBy addressing these potential issues, you should be able to resolve the permission-related errors and successfully connect to your MySQL database from Django. If the problem persists, further investigation into server-specific configurations may be required."
