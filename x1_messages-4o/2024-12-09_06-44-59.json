We extensively use this library in our API and as we transition to creating a series of Python workers, it would be beneficial to have a similar structure to our API syntactics. Does such a library exist for Python?"

        "content": "Yes, there are several libraries in Python that offer functionalities similar to Lodash in JavaScript. Here are a few libraries that you might find useful:\n\n1. **PyToolz**: Toolz is a Python library that provides utility functions for iterators, functions, and dictionaries, much like what Lodash does in JavaScript. You can find it at [PyToolz on GitHub](https://github.com/pytoolz/toolz).\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install toolz\n   ```\n\n2. **Funcy**: Funcy is another library that provides a collection of functional programming tools for Python. It offers a range of utilities for working with sequences, mappings, and functions, similar to Lodash.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install funcy\n   ```\n\n3. **Underscore.py**: This is a Python port of the Underscore.js library, which is similar to Lodash. It provides a lot of functional programming helpers without extending built-in objects.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install underscore.py\n   ```\n\n4. **Lodash-Py**: While not as comprehensive as Lodash for JavaScript, Lodash-Py aims to bring some of the Lodash functionality to Python. It might be worth checking if it meets your needs.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install lodash\n   ```\n\nEach of these libraries provides various utilities that could help you achieve a similar syntactic structure to what you're familiar with in your JavaScript API. Consider looking into their documentation to see which one aligns best with your specific use cases and coding style."
