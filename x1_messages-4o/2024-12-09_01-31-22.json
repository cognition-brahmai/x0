It is used to unpack the elements of a list or tuple so that they can be passed as individual arguments to a function. When used in a function definition, such as `def function(*args)`, it is referred to as \"packing\", where it allows the function to accept an arbitrary number of positional arguments, which are then accessible as a tuple named `args` within the function."
