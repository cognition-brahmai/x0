So far, my code is able to output only some combinations, but not all. Here is what I have so far:\n\n```python\nstring = raw_input(\"Enter String: \")\nlength = len(string)\nfor i in range(0, length):\n    for j in range(0, length):\n        if i == j:\n            x = string.replace(string[i], string[i].upper())\n            print x\n```\n\nWhen I run this code and input \"fox\", the output I get is:\n\n```text\nEnter String: fox\nFox\nfOx\nfoX\n```\n\nHow can I modify my code to get all possible combinations of upper, lower and mixed case of the input string?"

        "content": "To generate all possible combinations of upper, lower, and mixed case for a given string, you can use a recursive approach or utilize Python's itertools library to generate all combinations of cases for each character in the string. Here is a solution using itertools:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef case_combinations(s):\n    # Generate all combinations of upper and lower case for each character\n    return map(''.join, itertools.product(*((c.lower(), c.upper()) for c in s)))\n\nstring = input(\"Enter String: \")\ncombinations = case_combinations(string)\n\nfor combo in combinations:\n    print(combo)\n```\n\n### How it Works:\n\n1. **`itertools.product`**: This function computes the Cartesian product of input iterables. For each character in the string, we create a tuple of its lower and upper case versions, e.g., `('f', 'F')`.\n\n2. **`map(''.join, ...)`**: This maps each tuple generated by `itertools.product` to a string by joining the characters together.\n\n3. **Result**: The function `case_combinations` will generate and return an iterator of all possible case combinations for the input string.\n\nWhen you input \"fox\", this code will output all possible combinations:\n\n```text\nfox\nfoX\nfOx\nfOX\nFox\nFoX\nFOx\nFOX\n```\n\nThis approach efficiently generates all case permutations for the input string."
