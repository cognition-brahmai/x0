For instance, I currently use this code to check if the key exists before deleting it:\n\n```python\nif 'key' in my_dict:\n    del my_dict['key']\n```\n\nIs there a more concise way to achieve the same functionality?"

This method allows you to specify a default value to return if the key is not found, which effectively suppresses the `KeyError`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nmy_dict.pop('key', None)\n```\n\nIn this line, `'key'` is the key you want to remove, and `None` is the default value returned if the key does not exist in the dictionary. This ensures that no error is raised if the key is not present."
