        "content": "Certainly! Here's a formatted summary of Pangaea:\n\n---\n\n**Definition of Pangaea:**\n\nPangaea was a supercontinent that existed during the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic eras. It was a massive landmass that combined almost all of Earth's land areas into one large continent.\n\n---\n\n**Time Period When Pangaea Existed:**\n\nPangaea formed approximately 335 million years ago and began to break apart about 175 million years ago, during the Jurassic period.\n\n---\n\n**Explanation of How Pangaea Formed:**\n\nPangaea formed through the process of plate tectonics, where the Earth's lithospheric plates moved and collided over millions of years. The landmasses that would become Pangaea drifted together due to the movement of these tectonic plates, eventually merging into a single supercontinent.\n\n---\n\n**Major Geological Features of Pangaea:**\n\n- **Central Mountain Ranges:** Pangaea had a series of central mountain ranges formed by the collision of landmasses.\n- **Vast Interior Deserts:** Due to its immense size, Pangaea had vast interior deserts, as areas far from the ocean received less moisture.\n- **Coastlines:** The supercontinent was surrounded by the Panthalassa Ocean, with varied coastlines that would later become distinct continental boundaries.\n\n---\n\n**Examples of Modern-Day Continents That Were Once Part of Pangaea:**\n\n- **Africa**\n- **North America**\n- **South America**\n- **Eurasia (Europe and Asia)**\n- **Australia**\n- **Antarctica**\n\n---\n\nPangaea's breakup led to the formation of the continents as we know them today, driven by the continuous movement of tectonic plates."
