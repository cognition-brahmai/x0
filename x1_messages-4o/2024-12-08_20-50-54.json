Multiplication and Division first (from left to right):\n   - \\(7 \\times 2 = 14\\)\n   - \\(3 \\div 6 = 0.5\\)\n\n2. Now the expression is \\(4 + 14 - 0.5\\).\n\n3. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right):\n   - \\(4 + 14 = 18\\)\n   - \\(18 - 0.5 = 17.5\\)\n\nSo, \\(4 + 7 \\times 2 - 3 \\div 6 = 17.5\\)."
