        "content": "Yes, you can insert a column at a specific index in a pandas DataFrame using the `insert()` method. This method allows you to specify the position where you want to insert the new column. Here's how you can insert column 'n' at the beginning of your DataFrame:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Initial DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'l': ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], 'v': [1, 2, 1, 2]})\n\n# Insert column 'n' at the beginning (index 0) with the value 0\ndf.insert(0, 'n', 0)\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nThis code will result in the following DataFrame, with 'n' as the first column:\n\n```\n   n  l  v\n0  0  a  1\n1  0  b  2\n2  0  c  1\n3  0  d  2\n```\n\nThe `insert()` method takes three arguments:\n1. The index at which to insert the column (in this case, `0` for the first column).\n2. The name of the column (`'n'`).\n3. The data for the column (in this case, `0`, which will be broadcast to all rows)."
