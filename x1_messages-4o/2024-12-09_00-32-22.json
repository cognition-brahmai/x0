How can I solve this?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to how Python handles module imports and the way your project structure is set up. Here are a few steps to help you resolve it:\n\n1. **Correct Project Structure**:\n   Ensure that your directory structure is correctly set up to be recognized as a package. The `__init__.py` file is crucial because it tells Python that the directory should be treated as a package.\n\n2. **Directory Hierarchy**:\n   From your description, it seems there might be a misunderstanding about the directory hierarchy. Here's how it should ideally look:\n\n   ```\n   myapp/\n       __init__.py\n       myapp.py\n       SomeObject.py\n   tests/\n       __init__.py\n       TestCase.py\n   ```\n\n   Ensure that the `tests` directory also has an `__init__.py`, which allows it to be treated as part of the package.\n\n3. **Modify Import Paths**:\n   Depending on how you run your scripts, the import paths might need slight adjustments. Here's how you can adjust the imports:\n\n   - In `myapp.py`, import `SomeObject` directly if it resides in the same package level:\n\n     ```python\n     from . import SomeObject\n     ```\n\n   - In `TestCase.py`, since it is outside of the main `myapp` package, you can adjust the import to:\n\n     ```python\n     from myapp import SomeObject\n     ```\n\n4. **Setting the Python Path**:\n   When running your scripts, make sure your Python path includes the top-level directory where `myapp` is located. You can do this by:\n\n   - Running your script from the top-level directory: Ensure you are in the directory that contains `myapp` and then run your script using `python -m`:\n\n     ```bash\n     python -m tests.TestCase\n     ```\n\n   - Alternatively, you can temporarily add the directory to your `PYTHONPATH`:\n\n     ```bash\n     export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)\n     python tests/TestCase.py\n     ```\n\n5. **Using Virtual Environments**:\n   Consider using a virtual environment to manage dependencies and ensure your Python path is set correctly.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to correctly import `SomeObject` in both `myapp.py` and `TestCase.py`. If you encounter further issues, double-check the directory structure and ensure that the Python path is set correctly."
