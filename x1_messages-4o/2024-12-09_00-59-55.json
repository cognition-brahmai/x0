The error message I'm receiving is:\n\n```\nCommand \"/usr/bin/python3.5 -u -c \"\n    import setuptools, tokenize;\n    __file__='/tmp/pip-build-tl8y2tfg/psutil/setup.py';\n    f=getattr(tokenize, 'open', open)(__file__);\n    code=f.read().replace('\\r\\n', '\\n');\n    f.close();\n    exec(compile(code, __file__, 'exec'))\n\"install \n    --record /tmp/pip-7t8rbku0-record/install-record.txt \n    --single-version-externally-managed --compile\" \nfailed with error code 1 in /tmp/pip-build-tl8y2tfg/psutil/\n```\n\nI've followed the steps from the installation manual provided in the auto-sklearn documentation and also tried the commands from a similar issue on Stack Overflow, but neither of these have resolved my problem. Notably, there are no files or directories that begin with \"pip-\" present in my `/tmp/` directory. How can I successfully install auto-sklearn?"

        "content": "Installing `auto-sklearn` can sometimes be challenging due to its dependencies. Here are some steps to help you troubleshoot and successfully install it on your Ubuntu 16.04.2 system:\n\n1. **Upgrade pip and setuptools**: Before installing, ensure that your `pip` and `setuptools` are up to date:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get install python3-pip\n   pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel\n   ```\n\n2. **Install system dependencies**: `auto-sklearn` requires several system-level dependencies. Install them with:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install build-essential swig\n   sudo apt-get install python3-dev\n   sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev\n   sudo apt-get install libpq-dev\n   ```\n\n3. **Install additional Python dependencies**: You may need to manually install some Python modules before installing `auto-sklearn`.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip3 install cython\n   pip3 install numpy scipy scikit-learn\n   pip3 install psutil\n   ```\n\n4. **Create a virtual environment**: It's a good idea to install `auto-sklearn` in a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other packages.\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install python3-venv\n   python3 -m venv autosklearn-env\n   source autosklearn-env/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n5. **Install auto-sklearn**: Now, try installing `auto-sklearn`:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install auto-sklearn\n   ```\n\n6. **Check for specific errors**: If you still encounter issues, check the error messages for specific missing packages or compilation errors. You might need additional libraries depending on the error message.\n\n7. **Consult the documentation and community**: If problems persist, consult the [auto-sklearn documentation](https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/master/) and consider reaching out to community forums or their GitHub issues page for more specific advice.\n\n8. **Consider upgrading your OS**: Lastly, if feasible, consider upgrading your operating system to a more recent version, as Ubuntu 16.04 is quite old and might lack support for some newer libraries and dependencies.\n\nFollowing these steps should help you resolve the installation issues and successfully install `auto-sklearn`."
