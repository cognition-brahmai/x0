I have decided to use the min-max algorithm for this purpose, but I am concerned that the values of incoming data objects will be calculated differently as the values of min and max may vary. Is my understanding correct? If it is, can you suggest an alternative algorithm that I should use?"

        "content": "Your understanding is correct. The Min-Max normalization scales data to a specific range [0, 1] based on the minimum and maximum values of the dataset. When dealing with streaming data, the min and max values can change as new data arrives, potentially leading to inconsistencies in normalized values over time.\n\nTo address this issue, consider the following alternatives:\n\n1. **Z-score Normalization (Standardization):** This method transforms the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It is less sensitive to changes in the range because it accounts for the mean and standard deviation. However, you'll need to compute these statistics iteratively as new data arrives.\n\n2. **Robust Scaling:** This approach uses the median and the interquartile range (IQR) for scaling, making it robust to outliers. It scales data to a range defined by the IQR, which remains relatively stable even if the dataset grows.\n\n3. **Adaptive Normalization:** Maintain a sliding window of the most recent data points and calculate min-max values based on this window. This way, normalization adapts to recent data without being overly influenced by older values.\n\n4. **Log Transformation:** Apply a log transformation if the data is skewed. This can stabilize variance and make the data more normally distributed, which can help in certain scenarios.\n\nWhen choosing a normalization strategy for streaming data, consider the nature of your data and the specific requirements of your application. If computational efficiency is a concern, you might also look into incremental or online normalization methods that update statistics dynamically as new data arrives."
