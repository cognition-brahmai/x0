I have previously set up assertion-style tests that raise my own exceptions; for instance, when creating a `Node` object with certain arguments, it checks if the arguments are valid for creating a node, and if not, it raises a `NodeError`. I am aware that Python has a `-o` mode where asserts are skipped which can make my program more efficient, but I want to maintain my custom exceptions. How can I use assert with my own exceptions?"

        "content": "In Python, the `assert` statement is designed to raise an `AssertionError` when its condition evaluates to `False`. However, it does not directly support raising custom exceptions. If you want to have the functionality of assertions while raising a custom exception, you will need to explicitly implement that logic using an `if` statement instead of relying on `assert`.\n\nHere's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nclass NodeError(Exception):\n    pass\n\ndef create_node(arg):\n    # Replace assert with an if statement that raises your custom exception\n    if not is_valid_node(arg):\n        raise NodeError(f\"Invalid argument for creating a node: {arg}\")\n    \n    # Continue with the rest of your function...\n    # For example, creating and returning the node\n    return Node(arg)\n\ndef is_valid_node(arg):\n    # Placeholder function to check if the argument is valid for a node\n    # Replace this with your actual validation logic\n    return isinstance(arg, int) and arg > 0\n\n# Example usage\ntry:\n    node = create_node(-1)\nexcept NodeError as e:\n    print(e)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `is_valid_node` function is a placeholder for whatever logic you use to determine if an argument is valid for creating a node. If the argument is invalid, the `NodeError` is raised with a custom error message.\n\nUsing this approach, you achieve two things:\n1. You maintain the ability to raise custom exceptions specific to your application logic.\n2. You avoid the potential pitfalls of using `assert`, which can be globally disabled with the `-O` or `-OO` flags when running Python, potentially skipping important validation checks.\n\nThis method also provides greater clarity and flexibility in handling different error conditions, as you can easily modify the exception raising logic or add more complex conditions as necessary."
