        "content": "To obtain a list of methods in a Python class, you can use the `inspect` module, which provides several useful functions to get information about live objects, including classes and their methods. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using `inspect.getmembers`**: This function can retrieve all the members of a class. You can filter these to get only the methods.\n\n2. **Using `dir()` and checking callable**: Another way is to list all attributes using `dir()` and filter out the callable ones that belong to the class.\n\nHere's an example of both approaches:\n\n### Using `inspect.getmembers`\n\n```python\nimport inspect\n\nclass MyClass:\n    def method_one(self):\n        pass\n\n    def method_two(self):\n        pass\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def static_method():\n        pass\n\n    @classmethod\n    def class_method(cls):\n        pass\n\n# Get all methods\nmethods = inspect.getmembers(MyClass, predicate=inspect.isfunction)\n\n# Print method names\nfor name, method in methods:\n    print(name)\n```\n\n### Using `dir()` and `callable()`\n\n```python\nclass MyClass:\n    def method_one(self):\n        pass\n\n    def method_two(self):\n        pass\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def static_method():\n        pass\n\n    @classmethod\n    def class_method(cls):\n        pass\n\n# Create an instance\nobj = MyClass()\n\n# Get all attributes and filter callable methods\nmethods = [method_name for method_name in dir(obj) if callable(getattr(obj, method_name)) and not method_name.startswith(\"__\")]\n\n# Print method names\nfor method in methods:\n    print(method)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`inspect.getmembers`**: This function returns all the members of a class, and by using `inspect.isfunction`, we can filter out the methods. Note that this will include functions defined in the class, but not inherited methods.\n\n- **`dir()` and `callable()`**: This approach lists all attributes of the instance and filters out the callable ones. This will include all methods, including inherited ones, and any callable attributes.\n\nChoose the method that best suits your needs depending on whether you want to include inherited methods or not."
