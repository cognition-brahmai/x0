        "content": "In Python, you can use the `isinstance()` function to check if an object is an instance of a class or a tuple of classes. To use the negation form of `isinstance()`, you can simply use the `not` keyword. This allows you to check if an object is not an instance of a specific class or tuple of classes.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\n# Define a sample class\nclass Animal:\n    pass\n\n# Create an instance of Animal\na = Animal()\n\n# Check if 'a' is not an instance of Animal\nif not isinstance(a, Animal):\n    print(\"a is not an instance of Animal\")\nelse:\n    print(\"a is an instance of Animal\")\n\n# Check if 'a' is not an instance of a different class, for example, list\nif not isinstance(a, list):\n    print(\"a is not an instance of list\")\nelse:\n    print(\"a is an instance of list\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `not` keyword is used to negate the result of `isinstance()`. The first condition checks if `a` is not an instance of the `Animal` class, which evaluates to `False`, so the else block is executed. The second condition checks if `a` is not an instance of the `list` class, which evaluates to `True`, so the if block is executed."
