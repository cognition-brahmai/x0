Here's a simple algorithm in pseudocode to find the smallest number in a given array:\n\n```plaintext\nAlgorithm FindSmallestNumber\n\nInput: An array A of n numbers\n\nOutput: The smallest number in the array\n\n1.  Start\n2.  Initialize a variable called 'smallest' with the value of the first element in the array, i.e., smallest = A[0]\n3.  For each element in the array starting from the second element (i.e., from index 1 to n-1), do the following:\n      a.  If the current element A[i] is less than 'smallest', then:\n            i.  Update 'smallest' with the value of A[i]\n4.  End For\n5.  Return 'smallest' as the smallest number in the array\n6.  End\n```\n\nThis algorithm assumes that the array has at least one element. It initializes the smallest number with the first element and iterates through the array to update the smallest value whenever a smaller element is found."
