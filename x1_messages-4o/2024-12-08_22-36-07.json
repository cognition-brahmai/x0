The room has a message written on the wall that reads, \"You should exit now.\" However, the game's AI has made it more challenging by transforming the message into \"Exit is your only option.\"\nTo crack the puzzle and escape the room, you need to convert the sentence from the second person to the first person, just like in the Go program. Replace the words \"you\" with \"I\", \"your\" with \"my\", and \"yours\" with \"mine\" to reveal the correct sentence.\nCan you do it?"
