        "content": "I am trying to understand how Python allocates memory for large integers. I have observed that an `int` type has a size of `28 bytes` and as I keep increasing the value of the `int`, the size increases in increments of `4 bytes`. For instance, if I run the following code:\n\n```python\n>>> a=1\n>>> print(a.__sizeof__())\n28\n>>> a=1024\n>>> print(a.__sizeof__())\n28\n>>> a=1024*1024*1024\n>>> print(a.__sizeof__())\n32\n>>> a=1024*1024*1024*1024\n>>> print(a.__sizeof__())\n32\n>>> a=1024*1024*1024*1024*1024*1024\n>>> a\n1152921504606846976\n>>> print(a.__sizeof__())\n36\n```\nI get `28 bytes` initially for any value as low as `1` and increments of `4 bytes` as the value increases. My questions are, why is `28 bytes` initially allocated for any value as low as `1` and why are there increments of `4 bytes`? I am running Python 3.5.2 on a x86_64 (64 bit machine) and I am looking for any pointers/resources/PEPs on how the Python 3.0+ interpreters work on such huge numbers."

        "content": "In Python, integers are represented as objects of the `int` type. Python's `int` is not limited by the size of a machine word, unlike languages like C where an `int` is typically 32 or 64 bits. Instead, Python's `int` can grow to accommodate as large a value as your machine's memory can hold.\n\n### Memory Allocation for Integers\n\n1. **Initial Size (28 bytes):** \n   - The initial size of 28 bytes for an `int` object in Python is due to the overhead associated with the Python object header. This header consists of several fields necessary for Python's memory management and object model, such as reference counts and type information.\n   - Specifically, the size breakdown can be explained as follows:\n     - A base overhead for every Python object, which includes reference count and a pointer to the object's type.\n     - Additional fields specific to the `int` type, such as the storage for the integer value itself.\n\n2. **Incremental Growth (4 bytes):**\n   - Python uses a variable-length representation for integers, which means that the size of the integer object increases as the value of the integer increases.\n   - The incremental growth of 4 bytes is due to the fact that Python stores integers in a format similar to a sign-magnitude representation, where the magnitude is stored in \"digits\". Each digit typically requires an additional 4 bytes on a 64-bit system. This allows Python to efficiently handle very large integers.\n   - The transition from 28 bytes to 32 bytes occurs when the integer value requires more than what can be stored in the initial allocation. Similarly, further increases happen when additional storage for more digits is needed.\n\n### Pointers/Resources:\n\n- **PEP 237**: This PEP discusses the unification of `int` and `long` types in Python 2.x and how Python 3.x handles integers as a single `int` type supporting arbitrary precision.\n- **Python C API**: Reviewing the source code of the Python C API, specifically the `Objects/intobject.c` file, can provide insight into how Python implements its integer type.\n- **Python's Memory Management**: Understanding Python's memory management and object model can also provide context on why certain overheads exist. Books like \"Python Cookbook\" and \"Fluent Python\" often cover these topics in detail.\n\nBy examining these resources, you can gain a deeper understanding of how Python handles integer storage and memory allocation."
