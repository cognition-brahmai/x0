The syntax for environment markers allows you to specify conditions under which a package should be installed. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\ninstall_requires=[\n    \"threadpool >= 1.2.7; python_version < '3.2'\",\n],\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, the `threadpool` package will only be installed if the Python version is less than 3.2. The semicolon (`;`) is used to separate the package specification from the environment marker. The condition `python_version < '3.2'` is evaluated, and if it is true, the package will be included in the installation."
