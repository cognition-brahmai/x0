Here's how you can modify your query:\n\n\\[\n\\text{{string query = \"SELECT * FROM Products INNER JOIN Inventory ON Products.ID = Inventory.ProductID WHERE Inventory.Quantity > 0\";}}\n\\]\n\nIn this modified query:\n\n- `INNER JOIN` is used to explicitly join the `Products` and `Inventory` tables based on the foreign key relationship (`Products.ID = Inventory.ProductID`).\n- The `WHERE` clause is added to filter the results to include only those products that have an inventory greater than 0 (`Inventory.Quantity > 0`). Make sure the column name `Quantity` matches the actual column name in your `Inventory` table that represents the quantity or stock level."
