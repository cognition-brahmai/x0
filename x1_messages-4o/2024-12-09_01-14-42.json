Can you identify what is wrong with my code?"

        "content": "The issue with your code arises from the way you're plotting the normal distribution. When you use `norm.pdf(h, mean, std)`, it computes the probability density function (PDF) values for the specific data points in your list `h`. The problem is that you're plotting these discrete points directly, which doesn't give you a smooth normal distribution curve.\n\nTo properly plot a normal distribution curve that represents the distribution of your data, you should create a range of values (a continuous set of points) around the mean and then calculate the PDF for those points. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\n\n# Your data\nh = [186, 176, 158, 180, 186, 168, 168, 164, 178, 170, 189, 195, 172,\n     187, 180, 186, 185, 168, 179, 178, 183, 179, 170, 175, 186, 159,\n     161, 178, 175, 185, 175, 162, 173, 172, 177, 175, 172, 177, 180]\n\n# Calculate mean and standard deviation\nmean = np.mean(h)\nstd = np.std(h)\n\n# Create a range of values for the x-axis\nx = np.linspace(min(h) - 10, max(h) + 10, 1000)\n\n# Calculate the PDF for the range of x values\npdf_values = norm.pdf(x, mean, std)\n\n# Plot the PDF\nplt.plot(x, pdf_values, label='Normal Distribution', color='blue')\n\n# Optionally, plot a histogram of the data for comparison\nplt.hist(h, bins=10, density=True, alpha=0.6, color='g', label='Data Histogram')\n\n# Add labels and show the plot\nplt.xlabel('Value')\nplt.ylabel('Probability Density')\nplt.title('Normal Distribution of Data')\nplt.legend()\nplt.grid()\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this code, `np.linspace(min(h) - 10, max(h) + 10, 1000)` creates a continuous range of values for the x-axis, and `norm.pdf(x, mean, std)` calculates the PDF for these values, resulting in a smooth curve. The histogram of your data is also plotted to visually compare the actual data distribution with the theoretical normal distribution."
