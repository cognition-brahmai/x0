Initially, the wall time is 349 ms but on running the same operation again, it drastically drops to 999 \u00b5s. I am using two 10000*10000 matrices for multiplication. Here is the code I executed:\n\n```python\nimport torch, numpy as np, datetime\ncuda = torch.device('cuda')\n\nac = torch.randn(10000, 10000).to(cuda)\nbc = torch.randn(10000, 10000).to(cuda)\n%time cc = torch.matmul(ac, bc)\nprint(cc[0, 0], torch.sum(ac[0, :] * bc[:, 0]))\n```\n\nThe time is low but still reasonable (0.35 sec for 1e12 multiplications). However, when I repeat the same operation, the execution time drops to 1ms. Why is there such a significant change in execution time? The same phenomenon can be reproduced on Google Colab."

        "content": "The difference in execution time you're observing for the PyTorch matrix multiplication on a GPU is related to several factors, including GPU warm-up, caching mechanisms, and optimized execution paths. Here's a breakdown of why this happens:\n\n1. **GPU Warm-up**: The first time you run a GPU operation, there is some overhead associated with initializing CUDA contexts, setting up the GPU for computation, and potentially loading CUDA kernels. This initialization takes time, which affects the execution time for the first operation.\n\n2. **Caching**: GPUs often use caching to store intermediate results and configurations. After the first execution, the necessary data and computation paths are cached, allowing subsequent operations to bypass some of the initialization steps and run significantly faster.\n\n3. **Kernel Optimization**: Modern deep learning frameworks like PyTorch use highly optimized libraries for tensor operations (e.g., cuBLAS for matrix multiplication). The first operation may include time for selecting and optimizing the execution path for the given input shapes and data types. Once this is done, subsequent operations benefit from these optimizations.\n\n4. **Asynchronous Execution**: GPU operations in PyTorch are often asynchronous. The `%time` magic command in Jupyter captures the time taken to launch the operation, but not necessarily its completion. To accurately measure GPU execution time, you might need to synchronize the device using `torch.cuda.synchronize()` before and after your timing code.\n\nTo better understand the timing, you can modify your code to include synchronization:\n\n```python\nimport torch, numpy as np, datetime\ncuda = torch.device('cuda')\n\nac = torch.randn(10000, 10000).to(cuda)\nbc = torch.randn(10000, 10000).to(cuda)\n\ntorch.cuda.synchronize()  # Ensure any prior GPU work is complete\n%time cc = torch.matmul(ac, bc)\ntorch.cuda.synchronize()  # Ensure the operation is complete\n\n# Second run\ntorch.cuda.synchronize()\n%time cc = torch.matmul(ac, bc)\ntorch.cuda.synchronize()\n```\n\nBy including `torch.cuda.synchronize()`, you ensure that the timing includes the actual computation time on the GPU, rather than just the time to dispatch the GPU operation. This approach should give you a more accurate representation of the execution time for both the first and subsequent runs."
