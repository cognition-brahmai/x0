        "content": "Yes, your Keras model will still be able to train even if the sample size is not divisible by the batch size. When you specify a batch size, Keras attempts to divide the dataset into batches of the specified size. In your case, with a sample size of 1000 and a batch size of 15, you would get 66 full batches (66 * 15 = 990 samples) and a final batch containing the remaining 10 samples.\n\nThis final batch, which is smaller than the specified batch size, will be processed during training just like any other batch. Keras is designed to handle such situations gracefully, so you don't need to worry about the remainder of the data. This allows you to use any batch size you prefer, even if it doesn't perfectly divide the total number of samples."
