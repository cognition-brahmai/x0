I am seeking a way to create a single list that contains all the possible permutations of these elements. For instance, if I have a list such as [[a, b, c], [d], [e, f]], I would like to get a list like [[a, d, e], [a, d, f], [b, d, e], [b, d, f], [c, d, e], [c, d, f]]. However, I don't know the value of n in advance. I initially thought that itertools.product might be a good solution, but it requires the number of arguments to be known in advance."

        "content": "You are on the right track by thinking about using `itertools.product` to solve this problem. `itertools.product` can indeed help you generate the Cartesian product of the lists, effectively giving you all possible permutations of the elements across the lists. Even though `itertools.product` requires arguments to be passed explicitly, you can handle this scenario by unpacking your list of lists using the `*` operator.\n\nHere's how you can achieve the desired result using `itertools.product`:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Your list of lists\nlist_of_lists = [['a', 'b', 'c'], ['d'], ['e', 'f']]\n\n# Use itertools.product with unpacking\nresult = list(itertools.product(*list_of_lists))\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nIn this code, `*list_of_lists` unpacks the list of lists into separate arguments, which `itertools.product` can then process. The result will be a list of tuples, each representing a possible permutation of elements from the input lists.\n\nThe output for the given example will be:\n\n```\n[('a', 'd', 'e'), ('a', 'd', 'f'), ('b', 'd', 'e'), ('b', 'd', 'f'), ('c', 'd', 'e'), ('c', 'd', 'f')]\n```\n\nIf you want the result as a list of lists instead of a list of tuples, you can use a list comprehension to convert each tuple to a list:\n\n```python\n# Convert tuples to lists\nresult_as_lists = [list(item) for item in result]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result_as_lists)\n```\n\nThis will give you:\n\n```\n[['a', 'd', 'e'], ['a', 'd', 'f'], ['b', 'd', 'e'], ['b', 'd', 'f'], ['c', 'd', 'e'], ['c', 'd', 'f']]\n```"
