How can I sort the entire dataframe according to the sorted index?"

Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming df is your DataFrame with a DateTimeIndex\n# First, ensure your index is a DateTimeIndex (if not already)\ndf.index = pd.to_datetime(df.index)\n\n# Sort the DataFrame based on the DateTimeIndex\ndf_sorted = df.sort_index()\n\n# Now df_sorted is your DataFrame sorted by the DateTimeIndex\n```\n\nBy using `sort_index()`, the entire DataFrame is sorted according to the index values, ensuring that all columns are rearranged to match the order of the sorted index. This is particularly useful for time series analysis, where the order of data is crucial."
