Hummus provides protein and healthy fats, making this a balanced snack.\n\n2. **Apple Slices with Almond Butter**\n   - Apples are high in fiber and vitamin C, and almond butter adds healthy fats and protein. This combination is satisfying and provides steady energy.\n\n3. **Trail Mix with Nuts, Seeds, and Dried Fruit**\n   - Choose a mix with unsweetened dried fruits, nuts like almonds or walnuts, and seeds such as pumpkin or sunflower seeds. This snack offers a variety of nutrients including fiber, healthy fats, and antioxidants.\n\n4. **Roasted Chickpeas**\n   - Chickpeas are a great source of protein, fiber, and various vitamins and minerals. Roasting them with a bit of olive oil and spices makes a crunchy, satisfying snack.\n\n5. **Hard-Boiled Egg with a Piece of Fruit**\n   - Eggs are an excellent source of high-quality protein and essential nutrients like choline, which is important for brain health. Pair it with a piece of fruit for added fiber and vitamins.\n\nThese options will not only satisfy your hunger but also provide essential nutrients to support both physical and cognitive functions."
