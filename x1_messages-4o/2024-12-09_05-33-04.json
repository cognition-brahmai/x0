        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the dynamic linker not being able to find the `libmysqlclient.18.dylib` library, which is required by the MySQLdb Python module. To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the dynamic linker can find the library. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n### Solution Steps\n\n1. **Locate `libmysqlclient.18.dylib`:**\n   Ensure that you have the `libmysqlclient.18.dylib` file in `/usr/local/mysql/lib`. If it's not there, you may need to reinstall MySQL or make sure the MySQL client libraries are properly installed.\n\n2. **Set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:**\n   You can set the `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to include the directory where the `libmysqlclient.18.dylib` file is located. This helps the dynamic linker find the library at runtime.\n\n   Open your terminal and execute the following command:\n   ```bash\n   export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/mysql/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH\n   ```\n\n   To make this change permanent, you can add the above line to your shell's startup script (e.g., `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bashrc`, or `~/.zshrc`).\n\n3. **Use `install_name_tool`:**\n   Alternatively, you can modify the `_mysql.so` file to look for the library in the correct location. Use `install_name_tool` to change the path:\n\n   ```bash\n   install_name_tool -change libmysqlclient.18.dylib /usr/local/mysql/lib/libmysqlclient.18.dylib /path/to/_mysql.so\n   ```\n\n   Replace `/path/to/_mysql.so` with the actual path to `_mysql.so` in your Python environment.\n\n4. **Restart Eclipse:**\n   After making these changes, restart Eclipse to ensure it picks up the new environment settings.\n\n5. **Verify the Python Path in Eclipse:**\n   Make sure that the Python interpreter in Eclipse is set up correctly to point to the Python version where MySQLdb is installed. You can check this in Eclipse under:\n   - Preferences -> PyDev -> Interpreters -> Python Interpreter\n   - Ensure that the paths include the directory where MySQLdb is installed.\n\n6. **Check Permissions:**\n   Ensure that you have the proper permissions to access the directories and files involved, especially if you're running Eclipse with specific user privileges.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the \"Library not loaded\" error and successfully import MySQLdb in your Python scripts."
