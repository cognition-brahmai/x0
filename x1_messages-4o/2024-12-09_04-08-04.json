Here are two methods to achieve this:\n\n### Method 1: Using `os.path`\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Given file path\nfile_path = r'C:\\stuff\\directory_i_need\\subdir\\file.jpg'\n\n# Get the directory name of the file path\nparent_directory = os.path.basename(os.path.dirname(file_path))\n\nprint(parent_directory)\n```\n\n### Method 2: Using `pathlib`\n\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n# Given file path\nfile_path = Path(r'C:\\stuff\\directory_i_need\\subdir\\file.jpg')\n\n# Get the parent directory name\nparent_directory = file_path.parent.name\n\nprint(parent_directory)\n```\n\nBoth methods should output `directory_i_need` as expected. The `pathlib` module is often preferred for its readability and ease of use, especially for complex path manipulations."
