I've also tried numpy.savez and numpy.load, but numpy.load seems to load a npy file into \"memory-map\" which makes regular manipulation of arrays really slow. For instance, when running the following code:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport numpy as np;\nimport time; \nfrom tempfile import TemporaryFile\n\nn = 10000000;\n\na = np.arange(n)\nb = np.arange(n) * 10\nc = np.arange(n) * -0.5\n\nfile = TemporaryFile()\nnp.savez(file,a = a, b = b, c = c);\n\nfile.seek(0)\nt = time.time()\nz = np.load(file)\nprint \"loading time = \", time.time() - t\n\nt = time.time()\naa = z['a']\nbb = z['b']\ncc = z['c']\nprint \"assigning time = \", time.time() - t;\n```\n\nThe loading time is really fast, but the assigning time is too slow:\n\n```python\nloading time =  0.000220775604248\nassining time =  2.72940087318\n```\n\nIs there a better way to store and load numpy arrays, ideally multiple arrays in one file?"

        "content": "If you are looking for faster storage and retrieval of large NumPy arrays, there are a few alternatives you can consider that may offer better performance:\n\n1. **HDF5 with h5py**:\n   HDF5 is a file format that supports the creation, access, and sharing of scientific data. It is particularly well-suited for handling large datasets.\n\n   ```python\n   import h5py\n   import numpy as np\n\n   n = 10000000\n\n   a = np.arange(n)\n   b = np.arange(n) * 10\n   c = np.arange(n) * -0.5\n\n   # Writing to HDF5\n   with h5py.File('data.h5', 'w') as f:\n       f.create_dataset('a', data=a)\n       f.create_dataset('b', data=b)\n       f.create_dataset('c', data=c)\n\n   # Reading from HDF5\n   with h5py.File('data.h5', 'r') as f:\n       aa = f['a'][:]\n       bb = f['b'][:]\n       cc = f['c'][:]\n   ```\n\n   This approach is generally faster for both reading and writing compared to using `np.savez`.\n\n2. **Zarr**:\n   Zarr is a library for chunked, compressed, N-dimensional arrays. It is designed to work with distributed and parallel computing.\n\n   ```python\n   import zarr\n   import numpy as np\n\n   n = 10000000\n\n   a = np.arange(n)\n   b = np.arange(n) * 10\n   c = np.arange(n) * -0.5\n\n   # Writing to Zarr\n   zarr.save('data.zarr', a=a, b=b, c=c)\n\n   # Reading from Zarr\n   arrays = zarr.load('data.zarr')\n   aa = arrays['a']\n   bb = arrays['b']\n   cc = arrays['c']\n   ```\n\n3. **PyTables**:\n   PyTables is another option that provides fast and efficient storage of large datasets.\n\n   ```python\n   import tables\n   import numpy as np\n\n   n = 10000000\n\n   a = np.arange(n)\n   b = np.arange(n) * 10\n   c = np.arange(n) * -0.5\n\n   # Writing to PyTables\n   with tables.open_file('data.h5', mode='w') as f:\n       f.create_array('/', 'a', obj=a)\n       f.create_array('/', 'b', obj=b)\n       f.create_array('/', 'c', obj=c)\n\n   # Reading from PyTables\n   with tables.open_file('data.h5', mode='r') as f:\n       aa = f.root.a[:]\n       bb = f.root.b[:]\n       cc = f.root.c[:]\n   ```\n\nAll of these methods provide efficient ways to store and retrieve large datasets. HDF5 with `h5py` is a popular choice due to its wide adoption and support for complex data structures. Zarr is beneficial for chunked storage and parallel processing. PyTables also offers good performance and flexibility. Choose the one that best fits your use case and environment."
