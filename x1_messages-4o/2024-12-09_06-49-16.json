This function is supposed to return two separate variables, `i` and `card`. However, when I tried to return these two values using `return i, card`, it gave me a tuple which is not what I want. Here is the code:\n\n```python\ndef select_choice():\n    loop = 1\n    row = 0\n    while loop == 1:\n        print('''Choose from the following options?:\n                 1. Row 1\n                 2. Row 2\n                 3. Row 3''')\n\n        row = int(input(\"Which row would you like to move the card from?: \"))\n        if row == 1:\n            i = 2\n            card = list_a[-1]\n        elif row == 2:\n            i = 1\n            card = list_b[-1]\n        elif row == 3:\n            i = 0\n            card = list_c[-1]\n        return i\n        return card\n```"

        "content": "In Python, when you want to return multiple values from a function, the most common practice is to return them as a tuple. However, if you don't want to return a tuple and instead want to handle each value separately, there are a few approaches you can consider:\n\n1. **Return a List**: You can return the values inside a list and then unpack them as needed.\n\n2. **Use a Custom Class or NamedTuple**: If the values are related and you want to give them meaningful names, you can use a class or a `namedtuple`.\n\n3. **Modify Global Variables**: While not generally recommended due to potential side effects, you can modify global variables within your function.\n\nHere's how you can implement each approach:\n\n### Approach 1: Return a List\n\n```python\ndef select_choice():\n    loop = 1\n    row = 0\n    while loop == 1:\n        print('''Choose from the following options?:\n                 1. Row 1\n                 2. Row 2\n                 3. Row 3''')\n\n        row = int(input(\"Which row would you like to move the card from?: \"))\n        if row == 1:\n            i = 2\n            card = list_a[-1]\n        elif row == 2:\n            i = 1\n            card = list_b[-1]\n        elif row == 3:\n            i = 0\n            card = list_c[-1]\n        return [i, card]\n\n# Usage\nresult = select_choice()\ni, card = result[0], result[1]\n```\n\n### Approach 2: Use a NamedTuple\n\n```python\nfrom collections import namedtuple\n\ndef select_choice():\n    Choice = namedtuple('Choice', ['index', 'card'])\n    loop = 1\n    row = 0\n    while loop == 1:\n        print('''Choose from the following options?:\n                 1. Row 1\n                 2. Row 2\n                 3. Row 3''')\n\n        row = int(input(\"Which row would you like to move the card from?: \"))\n        if row == 1:\n            i = 2\n            card = list_a[-1]\n        elif row == 2:\n            i = 1\n            card = list_b[-1]\n        elif row == 3:\n            i = 0\n            card = list_c[-1]\n        return Choice(i, card)\n\n# Usage\nchoice = select_choice()\ni, card = choice.index, choice.card\n```\n\n### Approach 3: Modify Global Variables\n\n```python\ni, card = None, None\n\ndef select_choice():\n    global i, card\n    loop = 1\n    row = 0\n    while loop == 1:\n        print('''Choose from the following options?:\n                 1. Row 1\n                 2. Row 2\n                 3. Row 3''')\n\n        row = int(input(\"Which row would you like to move the card from?: \"))\n        if row == 1:\n            i = 2\n            card = list_a[-1]\n        elif row == 2:\n            i = 1\n            card = list_b[-1]\n        elif row == 3:\n            i = 0\n            card = list_c[-1]\n\n# Usage\nselect_choice()\nprint(i, card)\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nReturning multiple values as a tuple is the most straightforward method in Python, but if you prefer not to use a tuple, you can consider one of the above approaches based on your specific requirements and context."
