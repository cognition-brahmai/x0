        "content": "To create a Node.js program that filters an array of strings based on their length, you can use the `Array.prototype.filter` method. Below is a simple example of how you can achieve this:\n\n```javascript\n// Function to filter strings by length\nfunction filterStringsByLength(strings, minLength) {\n  return strings.filter(string => string.length > minLength);\n}\n\n// Example usage\nconst stringsArray = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"pear\", \"grape\", \"kiwi\"];\nconst minLength = 4;\n\nconst filteredStrings = filterStringsByLength(stringsArray, minLength);\n\nconsole.log(filteredStrings); // Output: [ 'apple', 'banana', 'grape' ]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: We define a function `filterStringsByLength` that takes two parameters: `strings` (the array of strings) and `minLength` (the minimum length a string needs to have to be included in the output).\n\n2. **Filter Method**: Inside the function, we use the `filter` method on the array. The `filter` method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. Here, the test checks if a string's length is greater than `minLength`.\n\n3. **Example Usage**: We create an example array `stringsArray` and specify a `minLength`. We then call `filterStringsByLength` with these parameters and store the result in `filteredStrings`.\n\n4. **Output**: Finally, we log the filtered array to the console, which will contain only the strings with a length greater than the specified `minLength`.\n\nYou can run this code in a Node.js environment, and it will filter the strings as specified."
