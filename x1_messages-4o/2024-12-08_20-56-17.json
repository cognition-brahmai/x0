        "content": "To find the median age of the US population using your Excel dataset, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Prepare Your Data\nMake sure your Excel dataset is organized with two columns: one for \"Age\" and another for \"Number of People in that Age Group.\"\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Cumulative Frequency\n1. **Create a Cumulative Frequency Column:**\n   - Assume your \"Age\" data starts in cell A2, and \"Number of People\" starts in B2.\n   - In cell C2, enter the formula `=B2` to set the initial cumulative frequency.\n   - In cell C3, enter the formula `=C2 + B3`, and drag this formula down through the column to compute the cumulative frequency for each age group.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Total Population\n1. **Calculate Total Population:**\n   - In a new cell, let's say D1, enter the formula `=SUM(B2:Bn)`, where `Bn` is the last cell in the \"Number of People\" column. This will give you the total population.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Median\n1. **Calculate the Median Position:**\n   - Divide the total population by 2 to find the median position. For example, if your total population is in D1, enter the formula `=D1/2` in another cell, say E1.\n\n2. **Find the Median Age:**\n   - Look through the cumulative frequency column to find the first age group where the cumulative frequency is greater than or equal to the median position (value in E1).\n   - The corresponding age in the \"Age\" column is the median age.\n\n### Step 5: Output the Median Age\n- Once you have identified the median age, you can directly use this age value as the median age of the population.\n\n### Example:\nIf your dataset looks like this:\n\n| Age | Number of People |\n|-----|------------------|\n| 0   | 5000             |\n| 1   | 5200             |\n| 2   | 5300             |\n| 3   | 5400             |\n| ... | ...              |\n\n1. Compute cumulative frequency.\n2. Sum the \"Number of People\" column to get the total population.\n3. Divide the total by 2 to find the median position.\n4. Identify the age group where the cumulative frequency first reaches or exceeds this median position.\n\nThis will give you the median age of the US population in years."
