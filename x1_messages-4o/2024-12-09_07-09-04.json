        "content": "To use additional command line arguments with Gunicorn while starting a Flask app, you can leverage the `gunicorn` configuration and its hooks to parse custom arguments. However, Gunicorn itself doesn\u2019t directly support custom command-line arguments beyond its predefined ones. To work around this, you can use environment variables or a configuration file to pass custom settings to your Flask application.\n\nHere's one way to achieve this using environment variables:\n\n1. **Set up your Flask app to read from environment variables:**\n\n   Modify your Flask application to read custom configuration options from environment variables. For instance, you can use the `os` module to access environment variables within your app.\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   from flask import Flask\n\n   app = Flask(__name__)\n\n   # Example of reading a custom config value\n   app.config['FOO'] = os.environ.get('FOO', 'default_value')\n\n   @app.route('/')\n   def hello():\n       foo_value = app.config['FOO']\n       return f'The value of foo is: {foo_value}'\n   ```\n\n2. **Set the environment variable before running Gunicorn:**\n\n   You can set the environment variable `FOO` before starting Gunicorn. This can be done in the command line as follows:\n\n   ```bash\n   export FOO=bar\n   gunicorn mypackage:app\n   ```\n\n   Alternatively, you can pass the environment variable on the same line:\n\n   ```bash\n   FOO=bar gunicorn mypackage:app\n   ```\n\n3. **Using Gunicorn hooks (Optional):**\n\n   If you need to perform some initialization or logging based on the custom argument when Gunicorn starts, you can use Gunicorn hooks in a configuration file. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   # gunicorn_config.py\n\n   def on_starting(server):\n       foo_value = os.environ.get('FOO', 'default_value')\n       server.log.info(f'Starting with FOO={foo_value}')\n   ```\n\n   Then, run Gunicorn with the configuration file:\n\n   ```bash\n   FOO=bar gunicorn mypackage:app -c gunicorn_config.py\n   ```\n\nThis approach uses environment variables, which are a common strategy for configuring applications in production environments, especially when direct command-line argument parsing is not supported by the server framework."
