        "content": "To get the number of seconds since the epoch from a date and time string like 'Jul 9, 2009 @ 20:02:58 UTC', you should use the `datetime` module in Python, which provides a straightforward way to parse the date and time and convert it to a timestamp. The `time.strftime` function is not suitable for this purpose as it is primarily used for formatting a `time` object as a string rather than parsing a string into a `time` object.\n\nHere is how you can accomplish this using the `datetime` module:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Define the date and time string\ndate_string = 'Jul 9, 2009 @ 20:02:58 UTC'\n\n# Define the format of the date string\ndate_format = '%b %d, %Y @ %H:%M:%S %Z'\n\n# Parse the date string into a datetime object\ndt = datetime.strptime(date_string, date_format)\n\n# Convert the datetime object to a timestamp\ntimestamp = dt.timestamp()\n\nprint(f\"The number of seconds since the epoch is: {int(timestamp)}\")\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We define the format of the date string using `strftime` directives:\n  - `%b` is the abbreviated month name.\n  - `%d` is the day of the month.\n  - `%Y` is the four-digit year.\n  - `%H` is the hour in 24-hour format.\n  - `%M` is the minute.\n  - `%S` is the second.\n  - `%Z` is the timezone name.\n  \n- `datetime.strptime()` is used to parse the date string into a `datetime` object.\n\n- `datetime.timestamp()` is then used to convert the `datetime` object into a Unix timestamp, which is the number of seconds since the epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC).\n\nNote: If you are working in a timezone-aware context, you might need to handle timezones appropriately, possibly using the `pytz` library to set the timezone information for accurate conversion. The above code assumes the datetime is already in UTC."
