The main function is `f1()`, which returns a tuple, and the other function `f2()` calls `f1()` and returns a tuple as well. I am trying to test `f2()` by mocking `f1()` and returning a custom result. However, my tests are currently failing with an AssertionError. How can I correctly use Python's mock library to patch `f1()` and return a custom result for testing `f2()`? Here is the code I am working with:\n\n```python\ndef f1():\n    return 10, True\n\ndef f2():\n    num, stat = f1()\n    return 2*num, stat\n```\n\nand here are my unsuccessful tests:\n\n```python\nfrom foo.bar import f2\nfrom mock import patch\n\nclass MyTest(TestCase):\n\n    def test_f2_1(self):\n        with patch('project.module.f1') as some_func:\n            some_func.return_value = (20, False)\n            num, stat = f2()\n            self.assertEqual((num, stat), (40, False))\n\n    @patch('project.module.f1')\n    def test_f2_2(self, some_func):\n        some_func.return_value = (20, False)\n        num, stat = f2()\n        self.assertEqual((num, stat), (40, False))\n```"

        "content": "To correctly mock the `f1()` function in your tests, you need to ensure that you are patching the correct import path that `f2()` uses to call `f1()`. This means you should patch `f1()` in the context of the module where `f2()` is defined, not where `f1()` is originally defined. \n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to correctly mock `f1()`:\n\n1. Identify the module where `f2()` is defined. Let's assume `f2()` is defined in the module `foo.bar`.\n\n2. Use the correct import path in the `patch()` decorator or context manager. You need to patch `f1()` as it is used in `foo.bar`.\n\nHere's the updated test code with the correct patching:\n\n```python\nfrom unittest import TestCase\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\nfrom foo.bar import f2\n\nclass MyTest(TestCase):\n\n    def test_f2_1(self):\n        # Patch `f1` as it is used in the context of `foo.bar`\n        with patch('foo.bar.f1') as some_func:\n            some_func.return_value = (20, False)\n            num, stat = f2()\n            self.assertEqual((num, stat), (40, False))\n\n    @patch('foo.bar.f1')\n    def test_f2_2(self, some_func):\n        some_func.return_value = (20, False)\n        num, stat = f2()\n        self.assertEqual((num, stat), (40, False))\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- Always patch the function as it is used in the module where the function under test is defined.\n- Ensure that the import path in the `patch()` call matches the way `f1()` is accessed within `f2()`. In this case, since `f2()` is accessing `f1()` from within the `foo.bar` module, you need to patch `'foo.bar.f1'`.\n- Use `unittest.mock` instead of `mock` when writing tests in Python 3, as `mock` is now part of the `unittest` library. \n\nBy following these steps, your tests should successfully mock `f1()` and pass as expected."
