I have a string such as \"ftp://www.somewhere.com/over/the/rainbow/image.jpg\" and I want to match both the start \"ftp://\" and end \".jpg\" in a single regular expression search. I tried using the following pattern, but it isn't working as expected: re.search(\"^ftp:// & .jpg$\" ,string). How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To use regular expressions in Python to match both the start and the end of a string, you need to combine the patterns for the start and end using a logical structure that allows both to be checked in the same expression. The `^` symbol is used to assert the start of a string, and the `$` symbol is used to assert the end of a string. However, the `&` operator is not used in regular expressions for combining patterns. Instead, you should clearly define the sequence you expect.\n\nHere's how you can write a regular expression to match a string that starts with \"ftp://\" and ends with \".jpg\":\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nstring = \"ftp://www.somewhere.com/over/the/rainbow/image.jpg\"\n\n# Regular expression pattern to match a string that starts with \"ftp://\"\n# and ends with \".jpg\"\npattern = r\"^ftp://.*\\.jpg$\"\n\n# Use re.search to find a match\nmatch = re.search(pattern, string)\n\n# Check if there was a match\nif match:\n    print(\"The string matches the pattern.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The string does not match the pattern.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `^ftp://` asserts that the string starts with \"ftp://\".\n- `.*` matches any character (except a newline) zero or more times, allowing for any characters in between the start and end.\n- `\\.jpg$` asserts that the string ends with \".jpg\". The backslash (`\\`) is used to escape the dot (`.`) because a plain dot in a regex pattern matches any character.\n  \nThis pattern will successfully match strings that begin with \"ftp://\" and end with \".jpg\"."
