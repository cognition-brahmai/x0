        "content": "Yes, you've correctly demonstrated how you can represent an SQL query in JSON format. This format is useful when you're working with systems that can interpret this JSON structure to execute the corresponding SQL query. This is often used in contexts where you are interacting with APIs or middleware that abstract SQL operations into JSON-based configurations.\n\nHere's a breakdown of your JSON representation:\n\n- **\"SELECT\"**: This key signifies that the operation is a selection or query operation.\n- **\"columns\"**: This specifies the columns to be retrieved from the database, in this case, \"country\" and \"capital\".\n- **\"from\"**: This indicates the table from which to retrieve the data, which is \"countries\".\n- **\"where\"**: This specifies the condition that must be satisfied for the rows to be selected. In your example, it uses the \"$in\" operator to match any country from the provided list, indicating that you only want to select European countries.\n\nThis JSON structure is particularly useful in applications where you want to dynamically construct queries based on certain parameters or conditions, and it provides a way to represent SQL operations in a format that is friendly for web services and APIs."
