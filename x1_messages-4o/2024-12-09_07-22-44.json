        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"connection already closed,\" typically occurs when the database connection is closed before your task completes. This can happen due to the long-running nature of your Scrapy parsing function. Here are a few strategies to help resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Use Database Connection Pooling:**\n   - Consider using a connection pooler like `pgbouncer` to manage database connections. It helps in reusing connections and can handle the overhead of opening and closing connections.\n\n2. **Close and Reopen Connections:**\n   - Ensure that your Celery tasks close database connections explicitly after completing a database operation. You can use Django's connection management utilities:\n     ```python\n     from django.db import connections\n\n     def close_db_connections():\n         for conn in connections.all():\n             conn.close()\n\n     @app.task\n     def my_task():\n         # Perform your task\n         close_db_connections()\n     ```\n\n3. **Increase Timeout Settings:**\n   - If you have control over the database server settings, you might want to increase the `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` or similar settings to prevent the server from closing idle connections.\n\n4. **Use `ATOMIC_REQUESTS`:**\n   - Enable `ATOMIC_REQUESTS` in your Django settings. This setting wraps each request in a transaction, which may help if your task is prematurely closing connections:\n     ```python\n     DATABASES = {\n         'default': {\n             ...\n             'ATOMIC_REQUESTS': True,\n         }\n     }\n     ```\n\n5. **Break Down the Task:**\n   - If possible, break down the long-running task into smaller, more manageable chunks. This can help keep each task within a reasonable execution time and reduce the likelihood of connection timeouts.\n\n6. **Use Celery's `acks_late` and `max_retries`:**\n   - Set `acks_late` to `True` in your Celery task to ensure that a task is acknowledged only after it completes successfully. Also, consider using `max_retries` to define retry behavior:\n     ```python\n     @app.task(acks_late=True, max_retries=3)\n     def my_task():\n         # Task logic\n     ```\n\n7. **Celery's Ping:**\n   - Utilize Celery's `ping` to keep connections alive. This can be a workaround to ensure connections are kept open during long tasks.\n\n8. **Use Django's `close_old_connections`:**\n   - If you are using Django, you can manually call `close_old_connections` from `django.db` at the beginning of your task to ensure any stale connections are closed:\n     ```python\n     from django.db import close_old_connections\n\n     @app.task\n     def my_task():\n         close_old_connections()\n         # Task logic\n     ```\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you should be able to mitigate the \"connection already closed\" error in your Celery tasks."
