My understanding is that the Tk keypress and keyrelease events should only fire when the key is actually pressed or released. However, with my simple code, if I hold down the \"a\" key I get a continual sequence of alternating keypress/keyrelease events. I am wondering if I am doing something wrong or if TkInter is buggy. I am using Python 2.7 on Linux mint. Here is my code and the output when pressing and holding \"a\":\n\nCode:\n```python\nfrom Tkinter import *\ndef keyup(e):\n    print 'up', e.char\ndef keydown(e):\n    print 'down', e.char\n\nroot = Tk()\nframe = Frame(root, width=100, height=100)\nframe.bind(\"<KeyPress>\", keydown)\nframe.bind(\"<KeyRelease>\", keyup)\nframe.pack()\nframe.focus_set()\nroot.mainloop()\n```\nOutput when pressing and holding \"a\":\n```python\ndown a\nup a\ndown a\nup a\ndown a\nup a\ndown a\nup a\netc...\n```"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is typical and not a bug in Tkinter or Python. This behavior is due to how the operating system handles keyboard input, specifically the auto-repeat feature. When you hold down a key, the operating system generates repeated keypress and keyrelease events at a certain rate, which is why you see alternating \"down\" and \"up\" events in your output.\n\nIf you want to detect only the initial keypress and the final keyrelease when the key is held down, you can implement a simple flag system to differentiate between the initial press and the auto-repeat events. Here's a modified version of your code that achieves this:\n\n```python\nfrom Tkinter import *\n\ndef keyup(e):\n    if e.keysym == 'a':\n        print('up', e.char)\n        key_states['a'] = False\n\ndef keydown(e):\n    if e.keysym == 'a' and not key_states.get('a', False):\n        print('down', e.char)\n        key_states['a'] = True\n\nroot = Tk()\nframe = Frame(root, width=100, height=100)\nframe.bind(\"<KeyPress>\", keydown)\nframe.bind(\"<KeyRelease>\", keyup)\nframe.pack()\nframe.focus_set()\n\nkey_states = {}\nroot.mainloop()\n```\n\nIn this version, we use a dictionary `key_states` to keep track of whether a key is currently pressed or not. When the `keydown` event is triggered, it checks if the key is already marked as pressed; if it is not, it prints \"down\" and marks the key as pressed in the `key_states` dictionary. The `keyup` event marks the key as not pressed. This way, you only get the initial \"down\" event when you first press the key, and only one \"up\" event when you release it."
