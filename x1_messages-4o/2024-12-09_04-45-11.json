        "content": "Certainly! In Python, when you use the `print()` function, it outputs text to a stream, which is usually the console or terminal. Streams can be buffered, meaning that data is not immediately written to the destination; instead, it is held in a temporary storage area called a buffer.\n\nThere are two main types of buffering:\n1. **Line buffering**: The buffer is flushed (i.e., written out) when a newline character is encountered.\n2. **Block buffering**: The buffer is flushed when it is full or when the program explicitly requests it.\n\nThe `flush` argument in the `print()` function is a boolean flag that determines whether to forcefully flush the buffer after the print statement executes. By default, `flush` is set to `False`, meaning the output may not appear immediately if the stream is buffered.\n\nHere's how to use it:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, World!\", flush=True)\n```\n\nBy setting `flush=True`, you ensure that the output is immediately written to the terminal, regardless of the buffering strategy. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need real-time output, such as in logging, progress indicators, or interactive applications.\n\nIn summary, using `flush=True` ensures that the output is promptly displayed, bypassing any buffering mechanisms that might delay it."
