I installed CUDA according to a specific guide and adapted the SDK Makefiles as per certain suggestions. However, none of the CUDA SDK examples are working. I am getting errors such as \"cudaGetDeviceCount returned 10 -> invalid device ordinal\" and \"cudaErrorInvalidDevice: This indicates that the device ordinal supplied by the user does not correspond to a valid CUDA device.\" I have checked the power plugs, but that did not solve the issue. How can I fix this?"

        "content": "The errors you're encountering suggest that your system is having trouble recognizing or correctly interfacing with your CUDA-capable GPUs. Here are several steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify GPU Recognition**:\n   - Use the command `nvidia-smi` to check if your GPUs are being recognized by the system. This tool should list all NVIDIA GPUs along with their statuses. If the GPUs are not listed, there may be an issue with the hardware connection or driver installation.\n\n2. **Check Driver Installation**:\n   - Ensure that the NVIDIA driver is correctly installed. You can check the currently installed driver version using `nvidia-smi` and verify if it supports Tesla C2075 and Quadro 600. Ensure that you are using a driver version compatible with both your GPUs and the version of CUDA you installed.\n\n3. **CUDA Toolkit Installation**:\n   - Make sure that the CUDA Toolkit is properly installed. You can verify this by checking the CUDA version with `nvcc --version`.\n\n4. **Environment Variables**:\n   - Ensure that environment variables for CUDA are correctly set in your `.bashrc` or equivalent shell startup file:\n     ```bash\n     export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}\n     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}\n     ```\n\n5. **Check Compatibility**:\n   - Confirm that the CUDA version you installed is compatible with your GPUs. Tesla C2075 and Quadro 600 are older models, so they may not be compatible with the latest CUDA versions.\n\n6. **Device Query Example**:\n   - Compile and run the `deviceQuery` example from the CUDA samples. This example helps verify that your CUDA setup can detect and communicate with the GPUs. If `deviceQuery` fails, it suggests an issue with the installation, drivers, or hardware.\n\n7. **Reinstall CUDA and NVIDIA Drivers**:\n   - If the above steps do not resolve the issue, consider reinstalling both the NVIDIA drivers and CUDA Toolkit. Be sure to follow the installation instructions carefully to avoid conflicts.\n\n8. **Kernel Module**:\n   - Ensure that the NVIDIA kernel module is loaded. You can check this using the command `lsmod | grep nvidia`. If not present, you may need to manually load it using `modprobe nvidia`.\n\n9. **Check for BIOS/UEFI Settings**:\n   - Ensure that any relevant BIOS or UEFI settings related to PCIe slots or GPU configurations are correctly set.\n\n10. **Review dmesg Logs**:\n    - Use `dmesg | grep -i nvidia` to check for any error messages related to the NVIDIA drivers during boot or module loading.\n\nBy systematically checking these areas, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue preventing your CUDA SDK examples from functioning correctly. If problems persist, consider consulting NVIDIA's forums or support for additional guidance."
