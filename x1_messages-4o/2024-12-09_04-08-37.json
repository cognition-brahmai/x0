        "content": "To sort a list of tuples in ascending order based on the second item (the integer value) in each tuple, you can use the `sorted()` function in Python with a custom sorting key. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Your list of tuples\nlist_of_tuples = [('abc', 121), ('abc', 231), ('abc', 148), ('abc', 221)]\n\n# Sort the list based on the second item in each tuple\nsorted_list = sorted(list_of_tuples, key=lambda x: x[1])\n\n# Print the sorted list\nprint(sorted_list)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `sorted()` function is used along with a lambda function `key=lambda x: x[1]` as the sorting key. This lambda function takes a tuple `x` and returns its second element `x[1]`, which is used as the basis for sorting. The result will be a new list sorted in ascending order based on the integer values:\n\n```\n[('abc', 121), ('abc', 148), ('abc', 221), ('abc', 231)]\n```"
