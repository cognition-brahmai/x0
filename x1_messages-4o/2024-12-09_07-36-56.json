After running the training, the output for Epoch 1/50 shows a training accuracy of 0.9381. I am trying to understand how this training accuracy is calculated. Is it the mean training accuracy, taken as the average from the 500 times the training is performed for every batch? Or is it the best (or max) training accuracy from out of the 500 instances the training procedure is run?\n\nHere is the code I am using for training:\n\n```python\nmodel.fit(Xtrn, ytrn, batch_size=16, epochs=50, verbose=1, shuffle=True,\n          callbacks=[model_checkpoint], validation_data=(Xval, yval))\n```"

        "content": "In Keras, when you train a model using the `model.fit()` method, the training accuracy reported at the end of each epoch is indeed the mean accuracy over all batches processed during that epoch. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Batch Processing:** With a batch size of 16 and a total of 8000 training samples, your training data is divided into 500 batches (8000 / 16 = 500). Each batch contains 16 samples.\n\n2. **Batch-wise Training:** During each epoch, the model processes each of these 500 batches sequentially. For each batch, the model updates its weights by performing backpropagation and computes a batch-specific accuracy.\n\n3. **Mean Accuracy Calculation:** The training accuracy for an epoch is calculated by averaging the accuracies from all 500 batches processed during that epoch. This gives you the mean training accuracy for the entire dataset for that epoch.\n\n4. **Reporting:** At the end of each epoch, Keras reports this mean training accuracy, which reflects how well the model performed across all the batches processed during that epoch.\n\nTherefore, the training accuracy you see (0.9381) at the end of Epoch 1/50 is the mean accuracy over all 500 batches for that epoch, not the best or max accuracy from any single batch."
