However, it seems to be picking up the entire node or cluster resource. I used the following code to set the configurations:\n\n```python\nspark  = SparkSession.builder\n                  .master(\"ip\")\n                  .enableHiveSupport()\n                  .getOrCreate()\n\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.executor.memory\", '8g')\nspark.conf.set('spark.executor.cores', '3')\nspark.conf.set('spark.cores.max', '3')\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.driver.memory\",'8g')\nsc = spark.sparkContext\n```\n\nBut when I include the configuration in the Spark submit, everything works fine:\n\n```bash\nspark-submit --master ip --executor-cores=3 --diver 10G code.py\n```\n\nCan you provide a solution for correctly setting the configurations in the Spark Session?"

        "content": "When you create a Spark session using `SparkSession.builder`, the configurations you set using `spark.conf.set` might not always take effect if the Spark session is already initialized. This is because some configurations can only be set before the Spark context is initialized. If you want to ensure that your configurations are applied, you should specify them in the builder itself, before calling `getOrCreate()`. Here's how you can adjust your code:\n\n```python\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\nspark = SparkSession.builder \\\n    .master(\"ip\") \\\n    .config(\"spark.executor.memory\", \"8g\") \\\n    .config(\"spark.executor.cores\", \"3\") \\\n    .config(\"spark.cores.max\", \"3\") \\\n    .config(\"spark.driver.memory\", \"8g\") \\\n    .enableHiveSupport() \\\n    .getOrCreate()\n\nsc = spark.sparkContext\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that the configurations are set before the Spark session is actually created. If you still face issues, make sure that there are no conflicting configurations set in the Spark defaults or environment variables.\n\nAdditionally, when running in a cluster environment, it's important to ensure that the cluster manager allows these configurations and that they are within the limits of the resources available to your Spark application. If you have specific settings in your cluster configuration files (like `spark-defaults.conf`), they might override your session settings.\n\nIf you're using a cluster manager like YARN, ensure that your resource allocations there are consistent with your Spark settings."
