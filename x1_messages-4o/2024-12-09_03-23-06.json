        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to the configuration of Celery in your Django application. The `worker_state_db` attribute is not a standard configuration option in Celery, which suggests that there might be a misconfiguration or a missing configuration option in your settings.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Celery Version:** Ensure that you are using a compatible version of Celery with your Django application. Sometimes, an upgrade or downgrade might be necessary if there are compatibility issues.\n\n2. **Inspect Celery Configuration:** Review your Celery configuration to ensure that all settings are correctly specified. In your Django settings, look for any misconfigured or deprecated options related to Celery.\n\n   Ensure that your `celery.py` file within your Django project directory is correctly set up. It should look something like this:\n\n   ```python\n   from celery import Celery\n   import os\n\n   os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'myApp.settings')\n\n   app = Celery('myApp')\n   app.config_from_object('django.conf:settings', namespace='CELERY')\n   app.autodiscover_tasks()\n   ```\n\n3. **Update Dependencies:** Update Celery and any related packages to the latest versions that are compatible with your environment. You can do this using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install -U celery\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for Custom Configurations:** If you have any custom configurations or extensions for Celery, ensure that they are correctly implemented and compatible with your current version of Celery.\n\n5. **Debugging:** Use the `-l debug` flag instead of `-l info` when starting the worker to get more detailed information about what's happening:\n\n   ```bash\n   celery -A myApp worker -l debug\n   ```\n\n6. **Review the Complete Error Traceback:** Sometimes the error might be triggered by another underlying issue. Reviewing the complete traceback leading up to the error might help pinpoint a more specific problem.\n\n7. **Consult Documentation/Community:** If the issue persists, consider consulting the Celery documentation or community forums for any similar issues or updates.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and fix the issue causing the `AttributeError`. If the problem persists, it might be helpful to provide more context or code snippets for further assistance."
