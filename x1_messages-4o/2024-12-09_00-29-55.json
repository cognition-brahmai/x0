        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this by using NumPy, a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. With NumPy, you can easily manipulate arrays and matrices. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to duplicate the values from the upper triangle to the lower triangle of your matrix:\n\nFirst, you need to install NumPy if you haven't already:\n\n```bash\npip install numpy\n```\n\nNow, you can use the following code to perform the task:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define your upper triangular matrix\ndata = np.array([\n    [0, 84.6, 97.4, 44],\n    [0, 0, 97.4, 84.6],\n    [0, 0, 0, 97.4],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0]\n])\n\n# Duplicate the upper triangle to the lower triangle\n# Using numpy's tril function to get the lower triangle indices\n# and copy values from the upper triangle\nrows, cols = np.triu_indices_from(data, k=1)\ndata[(cols, rows)] = data[(rows, cols)]\n\n# Print the resulting symmetric matrix\nprint(data)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Matrix Definition**: The matrix is initially defined with the upper triangular values filled in.\n2. **triu_indices_from**: This function retrieves the indices for the upper triangle of the matrix. By specifying `k=1`, we exclude the diagonal (since it's already zero in your case).\n3. **Assignment**: We then assign the upper triangle values to the corresponding positions in the lower triangle using the indices obtained.\n4. **Output**: Finally, we print the symmetric matrix.\n\nThis method efficiently fills the lower triangle by mirroring the upper triangle, resulting in a symmetric matrix."
