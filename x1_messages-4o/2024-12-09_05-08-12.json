If you want to rearrange the dictionary to a specific order, you can create a new dictionary with the desired order of keys.\n\nHere's how you can rearrange the dictionary:\n\n```python\noriginal_dict = {'a': 'first', 'b': 'second'}\n\n# Creating a new dictionary with the desired order of keys\nrearranged_dict = {'b': original_dict['b'], 'a': original_dict['a']}\n\nprint(rearranged_dict)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n{'b': 'second', 'a': 'first'}\n```\n\nThis method explicitly specifies the order of keys in the new dictionary."
