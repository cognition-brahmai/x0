However, when I run an incorrect command, the os.system does not raise an exception and instead it prints 'wrongcommand: command not found', and not my custom error message 'command does not work'. Why is this happening and how can I make it print my custom error message instead? Here is my code:\n\n```python\nimport os\ntry:\n  os.system('wrongcommand')\nexcept:\n  print(\"command does not work\")\n```"

        "content": "The behavior you're experiencing is because `os.system` does not raise a Python exception when a command fails. Instead, it simply returns the exit status of the command executed, which means it won't be caught by a `try`/`except` block.\n\nIn your case, the command `wrongcommand` is not found, so the shell prints an error message to the standard error stream, but no Python exception is raised. To handle this situation and print your custom error message, you can capture the exit status and check it. If the exit status is non-zero, it indicates an error occurred.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Run the command and capture the exit status\nexit_status = os.system('wrongcommand')\n\n# Check the exit status\nif exit_status != 0:\n    print(\"command does not work\")\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `subprocess` module, which provides more powerful facilities for running commands and can raise exceptions if something goes wrong:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\ntry:\n    # Run the command\n    subprocess.check_call('wrongcommand', shell=True)\nexcept subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n    # Handle the error\n    print(\"command does not work\")\n```\n\nIn this alternative approach, `subprocess.check_call` will raise a `CalledProcessError` if the command returns a non-zero exit status, allowing you to catch it and print your custom error message."
