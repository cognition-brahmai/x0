        "content": "The correlation coefficient is a statistical measure that describes the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. In this context, it represents the relationship between crime rates and pollution levels across various cities in the dataset.\n\nHere's how to interpret the correlation coefficient:\n\n1. **Value Range**: The correlation coefficient, often denoted as \\( r \\), ranges from -1 to 1.\n   - \\( r = 1 \\) implies a perfect positive linear relationship.\n   - \\( r = -1 \\) implies a perfect negative linear relationship.\n   - \\( r = 0 \\) implies no linear relationship.\n\n2. **Positive Correlation**: If the coefficient is positive (0 < \\( r \\leq 1 \\)), it means that as the crime rate increases, pollution levels also tend to increase. The closer the value is to 1, the stronger the positive relationship.\n\n3. **Negative Correlation**: If the coefficient is negative (-1 \\(\\leq r < 0\\)), it indicates that as the crime rate increases, pollution levels tend to decrease. The closer the value is to -1, the stronger the negative relationship.\n\n4. **Strength of the Relationship**:\n   - \\( 0.7 \\leq |r| \\leq 1 \\): Strong correlation\n   - \\( 0.3 \\leq |r| < 0.7 \\): Moderate correlation\n   - \\( 0 \\leq |r| < 0.3 \\): Weak correlation\n\nBy calculating the correlation coefficient using `corrcoef(data.crime_rate, data.pollution_level);`, you can determine whether there is a significant relationship between crime rates and pollution levels and how strong that relationship is. The scatter plot will visually display this relationship, with the title indicating the computed correlation coefficient to provide quantitative insight."
