This works on local installs and some Nginx servers. However, it doesn't seem to work on Heroku. I have tried almost all possible combinations in settings.py and none of them seems to be working. How can I solve this issue?\n\nHere are my code and settings:\n\nPython file:\n```python\nimport logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.info('some important infos')\n```\nSettings.py:\n```python\nLOGGING = {\n    'version': 1,\n    'disable_existing_loggers': False,\n    'handlers': {\n        'console': {\n            'level': 'INFO',\n            'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',\n            'stream': sys.stdout\n        }\n    },\n    'loggers': {\n        'django': {\n            'handlers': ['console'],\n            'propagate': True,\n            'level': 'INFO',\n        },\n        '': {\n            'handlers': ['console'],\n            'level': 'INFO',\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nShell command:\n```python\nimport logging\nlevel = logging.INFO\nhandler = logging.StreamHandler()\nhandler.setLevel(level)\nhandler.setFormatter(logging.Formatter('%(levelname)s: %(message)s'))\nlogger = logging.getLogger('info')\nlogger.addHandler(handler)\nlogger.setLevel(level) #even if not required...\nlogger.info('logging test')\n```\nI get some application logs but none of my logs appear in `heroku logs`. How can I fix this?"

        "content": "When deploying Django applications on Heroku, logging can sometimes be a bit tricky due to differences in how Heroku handles logging and environment configurations. Here are some steps and tips you can follow to ensure your Django logging works correctly on Heroku:\n\n1. **Check Python Imports**:\n   Ensure that `import sys` is included at the top of your `settings.py` since you are using `sys.stdout` in your logging configuration.\n\n2. **StreamHandler Configuration**:\n   Heroku captures logs from `stdout`, so using `StreamHandler` directed to `sys.stdout` is correct. However, make sure there are no typos or missing imports.\n\n3. **Logger Name Configuration**:\n   Double-check your logger names. If you use `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` in your code, it will inherit the module's name. Ensure that the logger configuration in `settings.py` matches this, or use an empty string `''` to catch all loggers.\n\n4. **Environment Variables**:\n   Make sure that your logging level configurations are not overridden by any environment variables set on Heroku. You can check and manage environment variables using `heroku config`.\n\n5. **Management Commands**:\n   If logging from management commands is not working, ensure that they are executed in an environment where Django's settings are fully loaded. Sometimes, specifying the settings module directly in the command can help:\n   ```bash\n   heroku run python manage.py your_command --settings=your_project.settings\n   ```\n\n6. **Check Heroku Log Drains**:\n   Ensure that your Heroku app is correctly configured to display logs. Sometimes, issues with log drains or viewing logs can cause logs to not appear as expected. You can check the logs with:\n   ```bash\n   heroku logs --tail\n   ```\n\n7. **Heroku Logging Add-ons**:\n   Consider using Heroku's logging add-ons like Papertrail or Loggly for more advanced logging features and easier troubleshooting.\n\n8. **Debugging**:\n   Add temporary debug print statements in your code to ensure that the log statements are reached during execution:\n   ```python\n   print(\"Debug: This line reached\")\n   logger.info('some important infos')\n   ```\n\n9. **Heroku Dyno Logs**:\n   Sometimes, the logs you are looking for might be in the dyno's startup or runtime logs. Make sure to check those as well.\n\n10. **Django Settings**:\n    Verify that your Django settings are being loaded correctly on Heroku. Sometimes, environment-specific settings can cause unexpected behavior.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and fix any issues with Django logging on Heroku. If the problem persists, consider isolating the issue by creating a minimal Django project to test logging in isolation."
