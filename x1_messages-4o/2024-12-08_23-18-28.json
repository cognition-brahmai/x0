        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find a positive integer \\( N \\) that satisfies the following conditions:\n\n1. \\( N \\) is the product of two different prime numbers.\n2. \\( N = a^2 - b^2 \\), where \\( a^2 \\) has a unit digit that is a multiple of 3.\n\nLet's break down these conditions:\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the difference of squares**\n\nThe expression \\( a^2 - b^2 \\) can be factored as \\((a-b)(a+b)\\). Hence, we need \\( N = (a-b)(a+b) \\).\n\n**Step 2: Unit digit of a perfect square**\n\nThe unit digits for perfect squares and their corresponding possible unit digits are:\n- 0: 0\n- 1: 1, 9\n- 4: 2, 8\n- 5: 5\n- 6: 4, 6\n- 9: 3, 7\n\nSince we need \\( a^2 \\) to have a unit digit which is a multiple of 3, the possible unit digits for \\( a^2 \\) are 9 (from \\( a \\equiv 3, 7 \\pmod{10} \\)).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze small products of two distinct primes**\n\nLet's consider small products of two distinct primes:\n\n- \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\)\n- \\( 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\)\n- \\( 2 \\times 7 = 14 \\)\n- \\( 2 \\times 11 = 22 \\)\n- \\( 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\)\n\nNow, checking \\( N = 15 \\) (product of 3 and 5):\n\n- \\( 15 = a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b) \\).\n\nWe need to find integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) such that:\n\n\\[ (a-b)(a+b) = 15 \\]\n\nThe possible pairs \\((a-b, a+b)\\) are \\((1, 15)\\), \\((3, 5)\\).\n\nFor \\((a-b, a+b) = (1, 15)\\):\n- Solving the equations:\n  - \\( a-b = 1 \\)\n  - \\( a+b = 15 \\)\n\nAdding these equations, we have:\n\\[ 2a = 16 \\Rightarrow a = 8 \\]\n\nSubtracting the first from the second:\n\\[ 2b = 14 \\Rightarrow b = 7 \\]\n\nChecking the unit digit of \\( a^2 \\):\n- \\( a = 8 \\Rightarrow a^2 = 64 \\), which does not end in a digit multiple of 3.\n\nFor \\((a-b, a+b) = (3, 5)\\):\n- Solving the equations:\n  - \\( a-b = 3 \\)\n  - \\( a+b = 5 \\)\n\nAdding these equations, we have:\n\\[ 2a = 8 \\Rightarrow a = 4 \\]\n\nSubtracting the first from the second:\n\\[ 2b = 2 \\Rightarrow b = 1 \\]\n\nChecking the unit digit of \\( a^2 \\):\n- \\( a = 4 \\Rightarrow a^2 = 16 \\), which does not end in a digit multiple of 3.\n\nSo, let's try another combination of primes. Consider \\( N = 21 \\) (product of 3 and 7):\n\n- \\( 21 = a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b) \\).\n\nThe possible pairs are \\((1, 21)\\), \\((3, 7)\\).\n\nFor \\((a-b, a+b) = (3, 7)\\):\n- Solving the equations:\n  - \\( a-b = 3 \\)\n  - \\( a+b = 7 \\)\n\nAdding these equations, we have:\n\\[ 2a = 10 \\Rightarrow a = 5 \\]\n\nSubtracting the first from the second:\n\\[ 2b = 4 \\Rightarrow b = 2 \\]\n\nChecking the unit digit of \\( a^2 \\):\n- \\( a = 5 \\Rightarrow a^2 = 25 \\), which does not end in a digit multiple of 3.\n\nFinally, let's try \\( N = 35 \\) (product of 5 and 7):\n\n- \\( 35 = a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b) \\).\n\nThe possible pairs are \\((1, 35)\\), \\((5, 7)\\).\n\nFor \\((a-b, a+b) = (5, 7)\\):\n- Solving the equations:\n  - \\( a-b = 5 \\)\n  - \\( a+b = 7 \\)\n\nAdding these equations, we have:\n\\[ 2a = 12 \\Rightarrow a = 6 \\]\n\nSubtracting the first from the second:\n\\[ 2b = 2 \\Rightarrow b = 1 \\]\n\nChecking the unit digit of \\( a^2 \\):\n- \\( a = 6 \\Rightarrow a^2 = 36 \\), which ends in 6, a multiple of 3.\n\nThus, \\( N = 35 \\) satisfies all conditions. Hence, the minimum positive integer \\( N \\) is 35.\n\n**Sum of the digits of 35:**\n\n\\[ 3 + 5 = 8 \\]\n\nTherefore, the sum of the digits of this integer is 8."
