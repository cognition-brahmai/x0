I need to create a graph that shows the number of people born in each month of each year. I've tried to accomplish this by grouping the data by year and month and then counting the occurrences, but I've only been able to group and count by either year or month separately, not both. The code I've used is:\n\n```python\ndf['birthdate'].groupby(df.birthdate.dt.year).agg('count')\n```\n\nI've seen references in other Stack Overflow questions to a \"TimeGrouper\" in Pandas, but I can't find any documentation on it. Can anyone help me group and count my data by both month and year?"

        "content": "To analyze your data by both month and year using Pandas, you can take advantage of the `groupby` method combined with the `pd.Grouper` function. The `pd.Grouper` is a powerful tool for grouping data with time-based indices or columns. Here\u2019s how you can achieve your goal:\n\n1. Ensure your `birthdate` column is in datetime format.\n2. Use `groupby` with `pd.Grouper` to group by year and month.\n3. Count the occurrences.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample data frame creation for demonstration\ndata = {'name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David'],\n        'height': [165, 175, 180, 160],\n        'weight': [65, 75, 85, 55],\n        'birthdate': ['1990-01-15', '1985-03-22', '1990-01-30', '1992-07-12']}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Convert birthdate column to datetime\ndf['birthdate'] = pd.to_datetime(df['birthdate'])\n\n# Group by both year and month, and count occurrences\ngrouped = df.groupby(pd.Grouper(key='birthdate', freq='M')).size().reset_index(name='count')\n\n# Extract year and month for clearer presentation\ngrouped['year'] = grouped['birthdate'].dt.year\ngrouped['month'] = grouped['birthdate'].dt.month\n\n# Drop the 'birthdate' column if you only want year and month\ngrouped.drop(columns='birthdate', inplace=True)\n\nprint(grouped)\n```\n\nThis will give you a DataFrame with the count of people born in each month of each year. You can then use a plotting library like Matplotlib or Seaborn to visualize this data:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Create a bar plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.bar(grouped.index, grouped['count'], color='skyblue')\nplt.xlabel('Year-Month')\nplt.ylabel('Number of People Born')\nplt.title('Number of People Born Each Month of Each Year')\nplt.xticks(ticks=grouped.index, labels=[f\"{y}-{m:02d}\" for y, m in zip(grouped['year'], grouped['month'])], rotation=45)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis setup will help you visualize the distribution of births by year and month effectively."
