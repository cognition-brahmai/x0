Now I'm looking for a similar function that returns the product of all numbers in an iterable. I believe such a function exists, but I'm unable to find it. For example, I want something like this:\n\nsomelib.somefunc([3,4,5]) == 3 * 4 * 5 == 60\n\nWhat is the equivalent function to sum() but for multiplication in Python?"

        "content": "In Python, there isn't a built-in function equivalent to `sum()` for calculating the product of all numbers in an iterable. However, you can achieve this using the `reduce()` function from the `functools` module along with the `mul` operator from the `operator` module. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom functools import reduce\nfrom operator import mul\n\ndef product(iterable):\n    return reduce(mul, iterable, 1)\n\n# Example usage\nresult = product([3, 4, 5])\nprint(result)  # Output: 60\n```\n\nIn this example, `reduce()` applies the `mul` operator cumulatively to the items of the iterable, starting with a default value of 1, to compute the product. This effectively multiplies all the numbers together in the list."
