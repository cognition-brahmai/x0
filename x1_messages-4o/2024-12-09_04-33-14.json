        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to a compatibility issue between the versions of the `protobuf` library and the TensorFlow Object Detection API you are using. This type of error often occurs when an update or change in the `protobuf` library is not compatible with the version of the TensorFlow Object Detection API you're using.\n\nHere are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Downgrade Protobuf**: An effective approach is to downgrade the `protobuf` library to a version that is known to be compatible. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or Jupyter notebook:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install protobuf==3.20.*\n   ```\n\n   This version is typically compatible with many versions of TensorFlow and the Object Detection API.\n\n2. **Check for Compatibility**: Make sure you are using a compatible version of TensorFlow and the Object Detection API. Sometimes, newer versions of TensorFlow might not be compatible with older versions of the Object Detection API and vice versa.\n\n3. **Update TensorFlow and Object Detection API**: If downgrading `protobuf` doesn't resolve the issue, consider upgrading TensorFlow and the Object Detection API to the latest versions. This can be done with:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade tensorflow\n   pip install --upgrade tensorflow-object-detection-api\n   ```\n\n4. **Modify Code (if needed)**: If you have control over the source code where the error occurs, you can sometimes fix this by modifying the code to remove the use of `_internal_create_key`. However, this is generally not recommended unless you are comfortable with making changes to the library code.\n\n5. **Create a Virtual Environment**: If issues persist, try creating a new virtual environment and install the required packages there. This can help isolate dependencies and avoid conflicts.\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: myenv\\Scripts\\activate\n   pip install tensorflow\n   pip install tensorflow-object-detection-api\n   ```\n\nOnce you've tried these steps, attempt to run your notebook again to see if the issue is resolved."
