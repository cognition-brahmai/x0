Even after deleting the .theanorc file from my Windows user directory, Theano tries to load from the GPU. I've only specified to install Theano, yet Conda wants to install everything including optional dependencies. When I run the command 'conda install theano', it displays the following:\n\n```python\nconda install theano\nFetching package metadata .............\nSolving package specifications: .\n\nPackage plan for installation in environment \nC:\\Users\\zebco\\Miniconda3\\envs\\py35:\n\nThe following NEW packages will be INSTALLED:\n\nlibgpuarray: 0.6.9-vc14_0\npygpu:       0.6.9-py36_0\ntheano:      0.9.0-py36_0\n\nProceed ([y]/n)?\n```"

        "content": "When you try to install Theano using Conda, it sometimes includes optional dependencies like `pygpu` and `libgpuarray` because these packages are often used to enable GPU support in Theano. Conda's package resolution mechanism may include these dependencies if they are considered optional but beneficial for enhancing performance or functionality, especially if they are available for installation.\n\nHere are a few things you can try to manage this behavior:\n\n1. **Specify the Environment:** Ensure you are installing Theano in a new or clean environment where there are no previous configurations that might influence package selection.\n\n   ```bash\n   conda create -n myenv python=3.6\n   conda activate myenv\n   conda install theano\n   ```\n\n2. **Install without GPU Support:** If you do not need GPU support, you might try installing Theano with a specific version that does not automatically include GPU dependencies. This might involve specifying a different channel or version that does not have these dependencies.\n\n3. **Skip Optional Dependencies:** Although Conda doesn\u2019t have a direct option to skip optional dependencies, you can manually uninstall them after installation if they are not required:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda uninstall pygpu libgpuarray\n   ```\n\n4. **Check Environment Variables:** If Theano is still attempting to use the GPU, check if there are any environment variables or system configurations that might be influencing its behavior. Specifically, look for `THEANO_FLAGS` or similar settings in your environment variables.\n\n5. **Edit Configuration Manually:** Since you mentioned deleting `.theanorc`, ensure no other configuration files are specifying GPU usage. You can explicitly set Theano to use the CPU by creating or editing `.theanorc` with the following configuration:\n\n   ```ini\n   [global]\n   device = cpu\n   ```\n\n6. **Consult Conda Channels:** Sometimes different channels might have different packaging strategies. If you are using the default channels, consider checking if other channels like `conda-forge` have different packaging for Theano that might not include optional GPU dependencies.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to control the installation of optional dependencies when setting up Theano with Conda."
