        "content": "A blockchain is like a digital ledger or record book that is shared across a network of computers. Imagine it as a chain of blocks, where each block contains a list of transactions. Once a block is filled with transactions, it is added to the chain in a way that is secure and unchangeable. \n\nEach block is connected to the one before and after it, like links in a chain, and they all have a unique code called a cryptographic hash that makes them tamper-proof. This means once information is recorded in a block, it\u2019s very hard to change it without altering every subsequent block, which would require the agreement of the majority of the network.\n\nBlockchains are decentralized, meaning no single person or organization has control over the entire chain. Instead, everyone on the network has access to the same information, which makes the system transparent and trustworthy. This technology is used in various applications, most famously in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, to ensure secure and transparent transactions."
