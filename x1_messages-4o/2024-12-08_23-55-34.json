        "content": "To prevent vehicle crashes, technology has been developed and integrated into modern vehicles to enhance safety. Here are three methods:\n\n1. **Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS):** These systems include features such as adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, and automatic emergency braking. They use sensors, cameras, and radar to monitor the vehicle's surroundings and assist the driver in maintaining safe driving conditions by providing alerts or taking automatic corrective actions.\n\n2. **Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Communication:** This technology enables vehicles to communicate with each other and with infrastructure like traffic signals and road signs. By sharing real-time information about traffic conditions, road hazards, and other critical data, V2X can help prevent collisions by alerting drivers to potential dangers before they are visible.\n\n3. **Autonomous Driving Technology:** Fully autonomous or self-driving vehicles use a combination of sensors, cameras, LIDAR, and AI algorithms to navigate and make driving decisions without human intervention. By eliminating human error, which is a leading cause of accidents, autonomous vehicles have the potential to significantly reduce crash rates.\n\nThese technologies are continually being developed and refined to improve safety and reduce the likelihood of vehicle crashes."
