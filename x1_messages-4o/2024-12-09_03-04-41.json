        "content": "I am attempting to configure a logger in Django that will log to the console. This is because I am using Heroku with Papertrails, Heroku's logging addon, and any console logs will appear in Papertrails, allowing for filtering and other features. Despite setting up the logger in my settings and my page_processors.py file, I don't see the logger when I refresh the page. I see the print and the file log, but not the console logger. I tried changing the logging.StreamHandler to STDOUT instead of STDERR, but it still doesn't work. What could be the problem?\n\nHere is the code I used:\n\nIn settings:\n```python\nLOGGING = {\n    'handlers' = {\n        'file': {\n            'level': 'DEBUG',\n            'class': 'logging.FileHandler',\n            'filename': 'mysite.log',\n            'formatter': 'verbose'\n        },\n        'console':{\n            'level': 'DEBUG',\n            'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',\n        },\n    },\n    (...)\n    'loggers'={\n        (...)\n        'page_processors': {\n            'handlers': ['console','file'],\n            'level': 'DEBUG',\n        }\n    }\n    (...)\n}\n```\n\nIn page_processors.py:\n```python\nimport logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n@process_for(MyPage):\ndef myfunc(request, Page):\n    logger.info('page_processor logging test')\n    print 'my page_processor print'\n    (...)\n```\n\nAfter refreshing the page, I see the print and the file log:\n```python\n[02/Mar/2014 23:07:10] INFO [myApp.page_processors:13] page_processor logging test\n```\n\nBut not the console logger. What could be the issue?"

        "content": "It looks like you've set up your logging configuration correctly, but there might be a few things to check to ensure that the console logging is working as expected:\n\n1. **Check the Logging Configuration Syntax:**\n   Ensure the syntax of the `LOGGING` configuration dictionary is correct. Particularly, ensure the use of colons (`:`) instead of equal signs (`=`) in the dictionary keys. For example, the `handlers` and `loggers` should be defined with colons.\n\n2. **Root Logger Configuration:**\n   Ensure that the root logger is configured to handle logs at the DEBUG level or lower and that it includes the `console` handler. Adding a root logger configuration can help catch logs that might otherwise be missed.\n\n   ```python\n   'root': {\n       'handlers': ['console', 'file'],\n       'level': 'DEBUG',\n   },\n   ```\n\n3. **StreamHandler Target:**\n   You mentioned changing `logging.StreamHandler` to `STDOUT`, but it's important to ensure that the console output is not being suppressed elsewhere. By default, `StreamHandler` logs to `stderr`, and this should generally work unless specified otherwise in Heroku or other configurations.\n\n4. **Heroku Logging:**\n   Check if Heroku's logging setup is configured to capture `stderr` output. Sometimes deployment environments have specific setups or restrictions. Make sure there isn't a platform-specific setting that affects how logs are handled.\n\n5. **Environment Variables:**\n   If you're running your Django app with a different configuration in production (e.g., using environment variables), ensure that the logging settings are correctly loaded in the deployed environment.\n\n6. **Check Logger Names:**\n   Ensure that the logger name used in `page_processors.py` matches the logger name in your `LOGGING` configuration. You're using `__name__`, which should resolve to the module's name, so ensure that this matches the name specified in the `loggers` dictionary.\n\n7. **Flush Logs:**\n   Sometimes logs may need to be flushed to appear in the console output, though this is less common with standard logging configurations.\n\nIf you've checked these and the issue persists, consider adding debug statements or temporary print statements to verify the flow and identify where the logs might be getting lost. Additionally, reviewing Heroku's logging documentation or support resources might provide more insights into how logs are managed and displayed in your specific environment."
