This issue can be resolved by restarting the computer, but I'm looking for a better solution. I've tried several solutions from the Nvidia forum and also attempted to unload and reload the driver, but nothing has worked so far. My setup includes OSX 10.6.8 and NVIDIA CUDA drivers : CUDA Driver Version: 4.0.31 (latest), GPU Driver Version: 1.6.36.10 (256.00.35f11). The device querying result and the code that may fail is provided below. Could you suggest a way to rectify this issue without having to reboot the system each time it occurs?"

        "content": "Encountering the \"all CUDA-capable devices are busy or unavailable\" error can indeed be frustrating. Here are a few suggestions that might help resolve the issue without requiring a system reboot:\n\n1. **Check for Processes Using the GPU:**\n   - Often, the error may occur if other processes are using the GPU resources. Use the `nvidia-smi` command to check for any processes that might be using the GPU. If you find any unnecessary processes, terminate them.\n\n2. **Reset the GPU:**\n   - Try resetting the GPU using `nvidia-smi --gpu-reset` if your GPU and driver support it. This can sometimes clear the issue without a full system restart.\n\n3. **Update CUDA and Drivers:**\n   - Ensure that both your GPU drivers and CUDA toolkit are up to date. Sometimes compatibility issues between the CUDA version and the driver version can cause such errors.\n\n4. **Check for Resource Leaks in Your Application:**\n   - Review your code to ensure there are no resource leaks. For example, ensure that all allocated memory is properly freed and that all CUDA streams and events are properly destroyed.\n\n5. **Reduce GPU Load:**\n   - If your GPU is under heavy load, consider optimizing your code to reduce resource consumption or running processes sequentially instead of in parallel.\n\n6. **Use CUDA Context Management:**\n   - Implement proper context management in your application. Ensure that contexts are created and destroyed correctly, as improper context handling can lead to resource exhaustion.\n\n7. **Increase GPU Timeout:**\n   - Modify the TDR (Timeout Detection and Recovery) settings on your system to increase the timeout value, which can prevent the driver from timing out during long-running computations.\n\n8. **Check System Logs:**\n   - Review system logs for any potential errors or warnings that might give more context about what is causing the GPU to become unavailable.\n\n9. **Reinstall Drivers:**\n   - As a last resort, consider completely uninstalling and then reinstalling the GPU drivers and CUDA toolkit to ensure a clean setup.\n\nIf none of these solutions work, it might be a hardware limitation or a deeper compatibility issue with your specific setup. In such cases, consulting with NVIDIA support or considering a hardware upgrade might be necessary."
