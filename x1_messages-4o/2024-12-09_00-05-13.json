If you have a $20 coupon that you can only use if the total purchase amount is greater than or equal to $100, how much would you need to spend in order to maximize your savings? Display the answer as a dollar amount with two decimal places. Good luck!"

        "content": "To maximize your savings, you want to spend just enough to be eligible to use the $20 coupon after the 15% discount is applied. This means that the discounted total should be at least $100.\n\nLet's denote the original price of the items as \\(x\\). After applying the 15% discount, the price becomes:\n\n\\[ x - 0.15x = 0.85x \\]\n\nTo use the $20 coupon, the discounted price must be at least $100:\n\n\\[ 0.85x \\geq 100 \\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[ x \\geq \\frac{100}{0.85} \\approx 117.65 \\]\n\nSo, the original price before the discount needs to be at least $117.65. If you spend exactly $117.65, the discounted price will be $100, and you can use the $20 coupon.\n\nNow, let's calculate the final price after using the coupon:\n\n1. Original price: $117.65\n2. Discounted price: \\(117.65 \\times 0.85 = 100.00\\)\n3. Apply the $20 coupon: \\(100.00 - 20 = 80.00\\)\n\nThus, to maximize your savings, you need to spend $117.65, and after all discounts and the coupon, you will pay $80.00."
