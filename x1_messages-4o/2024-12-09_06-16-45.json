        "content": "I am using Scala with Spark 2.0 to train a model with LinearRegression. The model is saved and loaded successfully for making predictions. However, when I try to continue training the model with new data by loading the saved model, I run into issues. Specifically, there is no 'fit' or 'train' function to continue the training after loading the model. When I load the LinearRegression object, it seems it does not save the weights, only the parameters for the algorithm. I confirmed this by training the same data for the same number of iterations and the result was the exact same rootMeanSquaredError, which certainly hadn't converged at that point of learning. I also can't load the model into LinearRegression, as it results in an error: \n\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: org.apache.spark.ml.regression.LinearRegressionModel.<init>(java.lang.String)\n\nHow can I get the LinearRegression object to use the saved LinearRegressionModel?"

        "content": "In Apache Spark's MLlib, once a model is trained and saved, it cannot be directly continued with further training using the same `LinearRegressionModel`. This is because Spark's MLlib does not support incremental learning or updating of the model with new data after the model has been trained and saved. The `LinearRegression` in Spark is designed for batch learning, meaning it processes the entire dataset at once rather than online learning.\n\nHere are a few approaches you can consider:\n\n1. **Combine New and Old Data**: One approach is to combine the new data with the old data and retrain the model from scratch. This is the most straightforward method but may not be optimal if the original data is large or if you frequently receive new data.\n\n2. **Transfer Learning**: Although Spark MLlib itself doesn't support transfer learning directly for linear regression, you can manually implement a form by using the weights of the saved model as an initialization for a new training session. Unfortunately, this would require a custom implementation as Spark does not provide an API to set initial weights directly for linear regression models.\n\n3. **Implement Custom Incremental Learning**: If your use case absolutely requires incremental learning, you might need to look into alternative libraries that support this feature or implement a custom solution. Libraries like Apache Flink or frameworks like H2O.ai might offer better support for continuous training.\n\n4. **Use a Different Framework**: Consider using a library that supports incremental learning, such as Vowpal Wabbit, which is designed for online learning scenarios.\n\n5. **Model Aggregation**: If retraining from scratch is not feasible, another approach could be to train separate models on different datasets and combine their predictions. This ensemble-like approach can sometimes be effective, although it's not truly continuous learning.\n\nAs for the error you encountered when trying to load the model, it might be due to a misconfiguration or incorrect usage of the API. Ensure that you are using the correct methods to load and utilize the model. For loading a model, you should be using:\n\n```scala\nval model = LinearRegressionModel.load(\"path/to/saved/model\")\n```\n\nThis method will load the saved model and its parameters correctly, but again, it cannot be further trained. It can only be used for making predictions with new data.\n\nIf you need further assistance with a specific framework or implementation, feel free to ask!"
