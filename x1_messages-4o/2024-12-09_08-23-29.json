I have installed the Oracle Instant Client library with libclntsh.so but I am not getting the expected output. Here's the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nconnection = cx_Oracle.connect(\"username/password@host/port\")\nprint (connection.version)\nconnection.close()\n```\n\nBut instead of getting the connection version, I'm getting this error message:\n\n```python\nFile \"script.py\", line 13, in \nconnection = cx_Oracle.connect(\"username/password@host/port\") cx_Oracle.DatabaseError: DPI-1047: Cannot locate a 64-bit Oracle\nClient library: \"libclntsh.so: cannot open shared object file: No such\nfile or directory\".

        "content": "The error you're encountering indicates that the cx_Oracle module is unable to locate the Oracle Client library (`libclntsh.so`). Here are the steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify Installation of Oracle Instant Client:**\n   - Ensure that you have downloaded and extracted the correct version of the Oracle Instant Client (64-bit) for your system. The Instant Client should match the architecture of the Python interpreter you are using.\n\n2. **Set Environment Variables:**\n   - You need to set the environment variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point to the directory where the Oracle Instant Client libraries are located. You can do this by adding the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file:\n\n     ```bash\n     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/instantclient:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n     ```\n\n     Replace `/path/to/instantclient` with the actual path to your Oracle Instant Client directory.\n\n3. **Install Required Packages:**\n   - Ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies installed. You can install these using the package manager:\n\n     ```bash\n     sudo apt-get install libaio1\n     ```\n\n4. **Verify the Libraries:**\n   - Check if the `libclntsh.so` file is present in the Oracle Instant Client directory:\n\n     ```bash\n     ls /path/to/instantclient/libclntsh.so*\n     ```\n\n5. **Test the Connection:**\n   - After setting the environment variables, open a new terminal or source the profile to apply the changes:\n\n     ```bash\n     source ~/.bashrc\n     ```\n\n   - Run your Python script again to see if the error is resolved.\n\n6. **Check cx_Oracle Version:**\n   - Ensure that the version of `cx_Oracle` you are using is compatible with the Oracle Instant Client you have installed. You might want to upgrade or downgrade `cx_Oracle` to match the Oracle Client version:\n\n     ```bash\n     pip install cx_Oracle==7.3.0\n     ```\n\n7. **Connection String:**\n   - Double-check your connection string. It should typically look like this:\n\n     ```python\n     connection = cx_Oracle.connect(\"username\", \"password\", \"host:port/service_name\")\n     ```\n\n   Ensure that you replace `username`, `password`, `host`, `port`, and `service_name` with the actual values.\n\nIf you follow these steps, you should be able to resolve the DPI-1047 error and connect to your Oracle database successfully."
