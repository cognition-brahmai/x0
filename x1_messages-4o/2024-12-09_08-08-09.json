I want to add a new column 'MA' to this dataframe, which calculates the rolling mean for the column 'pop'. I tried using the following code: `df['MA']=data.rolling(5,on='pop').mean()`, but I received a ValueError: `ValueError: Wrong number of items passed 2, placement implies 1`. I also tried using `data.rolling(5,on='pop').mean()` without adding a column and it worked. However, I still can't apply the rolling mean to the column 'pop'. What am I doing wrong?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the way you're attempting to use the `rolling` function. When you specify `on='pop'` within `rolling`, it is expecting a DateTime-like column to perform the rolling operation based on time. However, since you want to calculate the rolling mean directly on the 'pop' column, you should apply the `rolling` method directly to the 'pop' column itself, without using the `on` parameter.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to calculate the rolling mean correctly and add it as a new column 'MA' in your DataFrame:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming df is your DataFrame\ndf['MA'] = df['pop'].rolling(window=5).mean()\n```\n\nThis will calculate the rolling mean of the 'pop' column over a window of 5 rows and store the result in a new column 'MA'. If you want to adjust the window size, you can change the `window` parameter to suit your needs."
