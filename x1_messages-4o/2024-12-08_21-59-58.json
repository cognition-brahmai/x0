Unfortunately, I have plans this weekend and cannot work.\nAlex: I understand that you have plans, but our project is critical and we need to meet our deadlines.

Is there any other way we can catch up on the project without me working over the weekend?\nAlex: I understand your concerns about working remotely, but it is the best option we have at the moment. If we do not catch up on the project, we risk delaying the entire project and disappointing our stakeholders. Can you please reconsider and help us out?\nSarah: I see your point, and I want to help, but I am just not comfortable working remotely.
