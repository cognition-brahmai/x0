        "content": "PyTorch manages the computation of gradients for multiple models through its dynamic computation graph, which is built on-the-fly as operations are executed. Here's how it works when using multiple models:\n\n1. **Dynamic Computation Graph**: PyTorch constructs a computation graph dynamically during the forward pass. Each operation on tensors creates a node in this graph.\n\n2. **Autograd Mechanism**: Each tensor in PyTorch has an attribute `grad_fn` that references a `Function` that has created it (if it is a result of an operation with other tensors). This mechanism is part of PyTorch's automatic differentiation engine called Autograd.\n\n3. **Separate Graphs for Different Models**: When you have multiple models, each model's operations (including forward passes and loss computations) will contribute to separate computation graphs. If you perform operations with `model1`, the associated tensors and operations will form one graph. Similarly, `model2` will form another graph.\n\n4. **Loss Calculation**: When you compute separate loss values for each model, each loss value is tied to its respective model's computation graph. This is because the loss is computed from the outputs of the model, which trace back through the graph to the model's parameters.\n\n5. **Backward Pass**: When you call `loss.backward()`, PyTorch traverses the graph starting from `loss` and computes gradients for every tensor in the graph that has `requires_grad=True`. Since `loss` is tied to `model1`'s graph, gradients will be accumulated for `model1`'s parameters.\n\n6. **Independent Gradients for Each Model**: Similarly, `loss2.backward()` will traverse `model2`'s graph and compute gradients for `model2`'s parameters. The computation of gradients is isolated to the graph that the loss is connected to.\n\nIn summary, PyTorch handles multiple models by managing separate computation graphs for each model. The backward pass for each loss computation only affects the parameters of the model that contributed to that loss, ensuring proper gradient computation. Each model's parameters are updated independently based on its respective loss function."
