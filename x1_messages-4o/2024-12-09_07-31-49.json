How can I solve this issue and prevent the introduction of NaN values?\n\nFor instance, the following code:\n\n```python\nshape: (66441, 1)\ndtypes: prediction    int64\ndtype: object\nisnull().sum(): prediction    0\ndtype: int64\n\nshape: (66441, 1)\nCUSTOMER_ID    int64\ndtype: object\nisnull().sum() CUSTOMER_ID    0\ndtype: int64\n\nfoo = pd.concat([initId, ypred], join='outer', axis=1)\nprint(foo.shape)\nprint(foo.isnull().sum())\n```\n\nResults in a lot of NaN values:\n\n```python\n(83384, 2)\nCUSTOMER_ID    16943\nprediction     16943\n```\n\nI've tried to reproduce the issue with a simplified code:\n\n```python\naaa  = pd.DataFrame([0,1,0,1,0,0], columns=['prediction'])\nprint(aaa)\nbbb  = pd.DataFrame([0,0,1,0,1,1], columns=['groundTruth'])\nprint(bbb)\npd.concat([aaa, bbb], axis=1)\n```\n\nBut it works fine, with no NaN values introduced."

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing with the introduction of NaN values after concatenating two pandas DataFrames is likely due to a misalignment of the indices of the two DataFrames. When you use `pd.concat`, the default behavior is to align the indices, and if the indices do not match, NaN values will be introduced for the missing index positions.\n\nLet's go through the potential reasons and how to solve this issue:\n\n### Reasons for NaN Values:\n\n1. **Different Indices**: If `initId` and `ypred` have different indices, pandas will align them based on the index labels. This alignment can result in NaN values for indices that are not present in both DataFrames.\n\n2. **Index Reset**: Even if the DataFrames have been generated from the same original data, operations that modify the index (e.g., filtering, shuffling) might result in different index values.\n\n### Solutions:\n\n1. **Reset Index**: Ensure that both DataFrames have the same index or use the default integer index by resetting the index before concatenation.\n\n   ```python\n   initId = initId.reset_index(drop=True)\n   ypred = ypred.reset_index(drop=True)\n   foo = pd.concat([initId, ypred], axis=1)\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify Indices**: Before concatenating, check if the indices are aligned, and if not, either align them or reset them as shown above.\n\n   ```python\n   print(initId.index)\n   print(ypred.index)\n   ```\n\n3. **Use `join='inner'`**: If you want to concatenate only the rows with matching indices, use the `join='inner'` option in `pd.concat`.\n\n   ```python\n   foo = pd.concat([initId, ypred], join='inner', axis=1)\n   ```\n\nBy ensuring that the indices are aligned or by resetting them, you should be able to prevent the introduction of NaN values during concatenation."
