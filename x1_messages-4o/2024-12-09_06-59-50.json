        "content": "To move files between two AWS S3 buckets using the Boto3 API in Python, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Copy the file from the source bucket to the destination bucket.**\n2. **Delete the file from the source bucket.**\n\nHere's a sample code to demonstrate these steps:\n\n```python\nimport boto3\nfrom botocore.exceptions import NoCredentialsError, PartialCredentialsError\n\ndef move_file_between_buckets(source_bucket_name, destination_bucket_name, file_key, source_access_key, source_secret_key, destination_access_key, destination_secret_key):\n    try:\n        # Initialize the session for the source bucket\n        source_session = boto3.Session(\n            aws_access_key_id=source_access_key,\n            aws_secret_access_key=source_secret_key\n        )\n\n        # Initialize the session for the destination bucket\n        destination_session = boto3.Session(\n            aws_access_key_id=destination_access_key,\n            aws_secret_access_key=destination_secret_key\n        )\n\n        # Create S3 clients for both source and destination\n        source_s3_client = source_session.client('s3')\n        destination_s3_client = destination_session.client('s3')\n\n        # Copy the file from the source bucket to the destination bucket\n        copy_source = {\n            'Bucket': source_bucket_name,\n            'Key': file_key\n        }\n        destination_s3_client.copy(copy_source, destination_bucket_name, file_key)\n        print(f\"File '{file_key}' copied to '{destination_bucket_name}'.\")\n\n        # Delete the file from the source bucket\n        source_s3_client.delete_object(Bucket=source_bucket_name, Key=file_key)\n        print(f\"File '{file_key}' deleted from '{source_bucket_name}'.\")\n\n        print(\"File move operation completed successfully.\")\n\n    except NoCredentialsError:\n        print(\"Credentials not available.\")\n    except PartialCredentialsError:\n        print(\"Incomplete credentials provided.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {str(e)}\")\n\n# Example usage\nsource_bucket = 'your-source-bucket'\ndestination_bucket = 'your-destination-bucket'\nfile_key = 'your-file-key'\n\nsource_access_key = 'SOURCE_ACCESS_KEY'\nsource_secret_key = 'SOURCE_SECRET_KEY'\ndestination_access_key = 'DESTINATION_ACCESS_KEY'\ndestination_secret_key = 'DESTINATION_SECRET_KEY'\n\nmove_file_between_buckets(source_bucket, destination_bucket, file_key, source_access_key, source_secret_key, destination_access_key, destination_secret_key)\n```\n\n### Important Notes:\n\n- **Different Access Keys and Secret Keys**: The use of different access keys and secret keys will affect the process as you need to ensure that each set of keys has the necessary permissions to access the respective S3 buckets. Make sure that the IAM policies associated with these keys allow for the `s3:GetObject` permission on the source bucket and `s3:PutObject` permission on the destination bucket.\n\n- **Error Handling**: The above code includes basic error handling for credentials, but you may want to expand this to handle other potential issues, such as network errors or permission issues.\n\n- **File Key**: Ensure that the `file_key` matches exactly with the key of the file you want to move, including any directory structure in the key name.\n\nThis script will effectively \"cut\" the file from the source bucket and \"paste\" it into the destination bucket by copying and then deleting the original file."
