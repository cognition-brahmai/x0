I have tried list comprehension and the itertools module, but I am looking for a more elegant solution. I also want it to return a 'None' value instead of raising an exception if no match is found. Here are the solutions I've tried:\n\n```python\n[x for x in seq if predicate(x)][0]\n\nfrom itertools import dropwhile\ndropwhile(lambda x: not predicate(x), seq).next()\n\ndef get_first(predicate, seq):\n    for i in seq:\n        if predicate(i): return i\n    return None\n```\n\nI don't want to start filling the code with utility functions like the last one, especially if there are built-ins that can provide the same functionality."

        "content": "An idiomatic way to find the first element in a sequence that matches a predicate, while returning `None` if no match is found, can be achieved using Python's `next()` function combined with a generator expression. This approach avoids creating a full intermediate list, making it both memory efficient and elegant. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nnext((x for x in seq if predicate(x)), None)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The generator expression `(x for x in seq if predicate(x))` lazily evaluates the sequence, finding each element that matches the predicate.\n- `next()` is used to retrieve the first element from the generator.\n- The second argument to `next()` is a default value (`None` in this case) that will be returned if the generator is exhausted without finding any matching element.\n\nThis method is concise, efficient, and leverages Python's built-in functionalities effectively."
