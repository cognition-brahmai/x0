If you want to calculate the average weight of the stapes using MATLAB, you can use the following code:\n\n```matlab\n% Data for the bones in the ear\nboneNames = {'Malleus', 'Incus', 'Stapes'};\nboneWeights = [23.2, 27.4, 2.8]; % Weights in mg\n\n% Find the index of the smallest bone, which is the Stapes\nstapesIndex = find(strcmp(boneNames, 'Stapes'));\n\n% Calculate the average weight of the stapes\naverageWeightStapes = boneWeights(stapesIndex);\n\n% Display the result\nfprintf('The average weight of the stapes is %.2f mg.\\n', averageWeightStapes);\n```\n\nThis code identifies the index of the stapes in the list of bones and then calculates and prints its weight, which is indeed the smallest bone in the human ear. Since there's only one data point for the stapes in this context, the \"average\" is simply its weight."
