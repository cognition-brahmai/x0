I have a Google App Engine application at http://mylovelyapp.appspot.com/ and a page on it at http://mylovelyapp.appspot.com/mylovelypage that currently just writes 'OK' as a response. However, if I add login:required to this page in the app's yaml, running a Python script from my computer that fetches the URL content prints out the HTML of the Google Accounts login page instead. I've tried using \"normal\" authentication approaches and Google's ClientLogin auth API, but I can't seem to get it to work. Could I use the GData client library to do this?"

        "content": "To access an authenticated Google App Engine service from a non-web Python client, you can use OAuth 2.0 for authentication. This is a more secure and recommended way to authenticate and access Google services. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you achieve this:\n\n1. **Enable OAuth 2.0**: \n   Ensure that your Google App Engine application is set up to accept OAuth 2.0 tokens. You may need to configure the application to recognize the tokens.\n\n2. **Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials**:\n   - Go to the Google Cloud Console.\n   - Navigate to the \"APIs & Services\" > \"Credentials\" page.\n   - Click \"Create credentials\" and choose \"OAuth 2.0 Client IDs\".\n   - Set the application type to \"Other\" (for a non-web client).\n   - Note down the `client_id` and `client_secret`.\n\n3. **Install Required Libraries**:\n   Ensure you have the Google API client library installed:\n   ```bash\n   pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2\n   ```\n\n4. **Python Script for Authentication**:\n   Use the following Python script to authenticate and access your App Engine service:\n\n   ```python\n   from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials\n   from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow\n   import requests\n\n   # Set up the OAuth 2.0 flow\n   flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file(\n       'path/to/client_secret.json',  # Downloaded JSON file from Google Cloud Console\n       scopes=['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email']  # Adjust scopes as needed\n   )\n\n   # Run the local server to obtain the credentials\n   credentials = flow.run_local_server(port=0)\n\n   # Create a session and set the credentials\n   session = requests.Session()\n   session.headers.update({'Authorization': f'Bearer {credentials.token}'})\n\n   # Access the protected resource\n   response = session.get('http://mylovelyapp.appspot.com/mylovelypage')\n   print(response.text)\n   ```\n\n5. **Test the Script**:\n   Run the script on your local machine. It will open a browser window for OAuth consent. Once you authorize, it will print the response from the protected page.\n\n6. **Handle Token Refreshing**:\n   The `credentials` object manages token refreshing automatically, but make sure to handle and store refreshed tokens properly if you plan to use them long-term.\n\nBy using OAuth 2.0, you're leveraging a secure and standardized way to access Google services without dealing directly with user credentials."
