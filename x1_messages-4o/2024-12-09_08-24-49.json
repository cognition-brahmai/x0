I'm trying to activate this Python virtualenv, run a Python script, and then deactivate the virtualenv when the script exits. However, after activating the virtualenv, the batch script stops and doesn't run the Python script. I'm using the following code:\n\n```bash\n%~dp0env\\Scripts\\activate.bat\npython %~dp0work\\script.py\ndeactivate\n```\nIs there a way to \"source\" the activate script folder, so that the rest of the batch script can be run as if I'd called `activate.bat` from the command line?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is because the `activate.bat` script is designed to modify the environment of the current command prompt session and then return control back to the command prompt, effectively terminating the batch script execution at that point. To ensure the batch script continues execution after activating the virtual environment, you need to use the `call` command in your batch script, which will allow the batch script to continue executing after the activation.\n\nHere's how you can modify your script:\n\n```batch\ncall %~dp0env\\Scripts\\activate.bat\npython %~dp0work\\script.py\ndeactivate\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `call` is used to run another batch file from within a batch file. This allows the current batch script to continue execution after the called batch file (in this case, `activate.bat`) completes.\n- By using `call`, the environment changes made by `activate.bat` will persist for the rest of the script, allowing you to run your Python script and then deactivate the virtual environment.\n\nGive this a try, and it should work as expected."
