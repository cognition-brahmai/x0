Your goal is to sort the cards in descending order based on their \"primality value\", which is calculated by adding the two nearest prime numbers to each card's prime number. For example, if a card has the prime number 17 on it, the primality value would be 19+13+17+19 = 68. Once you have sorted the cards, please display them in a table with the following columns: Card number, Prime number, Nearest prime numbers, and Primality value. Good luck!"
