        "content": "When plotting data with matplotlib, the order of points is determined by the order in which data is passed to the plotting function. In your case, you want to plot the data in the order of the keys, which are integers. Here's how you can achieve this by sorting the dictionary keys and then plotting the values in that order:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Your dictionary\ndict_concentration = {\n    0: 0.19849878712984576,\n    5000: 0.093917341754771386,\n    10000: 0.075060643507712022,\n    20000: 0.06673074282575861,\n    30000: 0.057119318961966224,\n    50000: 0.046134834546203485,\n    100000: 0.032495766396631424,\n    200000: 0.018536317451599615,\n    500000: 0.0059499290585381479\n}\n\n# Sort the dictionary by keys and extract keys and values\nkeys_sorted = sorted(dict_concentration.keys())\nvalues_sorted = [dict_concentration[key] for key in keys_sorted]\n\n# Plotting\nplt.plot(keys_sorted, values_sorted, marker='o', linestyle='-')\nplt.xlabel('Key (Integer)')\nplt.ylabel('Value (Float)')\nplt.title('Plot of Concentration vs Key')\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1. `keys_sorted` stores the keys sorted in ascending order.\n2. `values_sorted` retrieves the corresponding values in the order of the sorted keys.\n3. `plt.plot()` is used to plot these values, connecting them in the order of the sorted keys.\n4. `marker='o'` ensures that each data point is marked on the plot, while `linestyle='-'` connects these points with lines.\n\nThis will ensure your lines are plotted in the correct order according to the integer keys."
