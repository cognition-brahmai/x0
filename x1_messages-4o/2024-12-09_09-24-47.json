        "content": "Certainly! To join two tables in a database based on a common column, you would typically use the `JOIN` clause in SQL. Here\u2019s a basic example using the `INNER JOIN`, which returns only the rows with matching values in both tables:\n\nSuppose you have two tables, `Customers` and `Orders`, and you want to join them based on a common column, `CustomerID`.\n\n```sql\nSELECT Customers.CustomerID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID, Orders.OrderDate\nFROM Customers\nINNER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;\n```\n\nIn this query:\n\n- `SELECT` specifies the columns you want to retrieve.\n- `FROM Customers` specifies the first table.\n- `INNER JOIN Orders` specifies the second table you want to join.\n- `ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID` specifies the condition for the join, based on the `CustomerID` column that is present in both tables.\n\nThis will return a result set that includes the `CustomerID`, `CustomerName`, `OrderID`, and `OrderDate` for all rows where there is a matching `CustomerID` in both the `Customers` and `Orders` tables.\n\nYou can also use other types of joins like `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, or `FULL JOIN` depending on your specific requirements."
