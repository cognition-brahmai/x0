        "content": "In Django, the standard use of a `ForeignKey` is to relate one model to another model, rather than to a specific field within that model. However, you can achieve the functionality you're describing by using a combination of Django's features and some custom logic.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to how you could implement this:\n\n1. **Define Models:**\n\n   You will have two models. Let's say you have a `ModelToValidate` which contains the fields you want to validate, and a `ValidationRule` model which contains the rules for validation.\n\n   ```python\n   from django.db import models\n\n   class ModelToValidate(models.Model):\n       field_1 = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n       field_2 = models.IntegerField()\n       # Add other fields as needed\n\n   class ValidationRule(models.Model):\n       model_to_validate = models.ForeignKey(ModelToValidate, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n       field_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n       can_be_null = models.BooleanField()\n       data_type = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n       valid_range = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n       # Add other validation criteria as needed\n   ```\n\n2. **Storing Field-Level Mapping:**\n\n   In the `ValidationRule` model, the `field_name` field is used to store the name of the field in `ModelToValidate` that you wish to validate. This is a string-based reference to the field name.\n\n3. **Custom Validation Logic:**\n\n   You need to implement custom validation logic that will read the `ValidationRule` entries for a given `ModelToValidate` instance and perform the necessary checks. This can be done using Django signals, by overriding the model's `save` method, or by creating a custom management command or script that processes these rules.\n\n4. **Example of Custom Validation:**\n\n   Here's a simple example of how you might implement a custom validation function:\n\n   ```python\n   from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError\n\n   def validate_model_instance(instance):\n       rules = ValidationRule.objects.filter(model_to_validate=instance)\n       for rule in rules:\n           field_value = getattr(instance, rule.field_name, None)\n\n           # Check if the field can be null\n           if not rule.can_be_null and field_value is None:\n               raise ValidationError(f\"{rule.field_name} cannot be null.\")\n\n           # Check data type (this is a simplified check)\n           if rule.data_type == 'int' and not isinstance(field_value, int):\n               raise ValidationError(f\"{rule.field_name} must be an integer.\")\n\n           # Check range\n           # Assuming valid_range is a string like \"0-100\"\n           if rule.valid_range:\n               min_val, max_val = map(int, rule.valid_range.split('-'))\n               if not (min_val <= field_value <= max_val):\n                   raise ValidationError(f\"{rule.field_name} must be between {min_val} and {max_val}.\")\n\n   ```\n\n5. **Integrating Validation:**\n\n   You can integrate this validation function into your workflow by calling it before saving the `ModelToValidate` instance or as part of a form's clean method.\n\nBy using this approach, you can define flexible field-level validation rules in Django that are stored in a database and can be dynamically applied to any instance of `ModelToValidate`."
