However, I seem to be getting the parent folder name instead. Also, I want to exclude other files in the folder from the list. I have written some code, but it's not working as expected. Can anyone help me identify where I am going wrong?\n\nHere's the code I have so far:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nfor directories in os.listdir(os.getcwd()): \n    dir = os.path.join('/home/user/workspace', directories)\n    os.chdir(dir)\n    current = os.path.dirname(dir)\n    new = str(current).split(\"-\")[0]\n    print new\n```\n\nI also tried the following code, but it didn't work either:\n\n```python\nfor directories in os.path.isdir(os.listdir(os.getcwd())): \n```\n\nI managed to get it working with the below code, but it feels a bit roundabout:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.chdir('/home/user/workspace')\nall_subdirs = [d for d in os.listdir('.') if os.path.isdir(d)]\nfor dirs in all_subdirs:\n    dir = os.path.join('/home/user/workspace', dirs)\n    os.chdir(dir)\n    current = os.getcwd()\n    new = str(current).split(\"/\")[4]\n    print new\n```"

        "content": "I see where the confusion might be coming from. Let's address the issues and simplify your code to achieve your goal. There are a few key points to consider:\n\n1. **Current Working Directory**: When you use `os.path.dirname(dir)`, it returns the directory name of the given path, which might be causing the confusion with getting the parent directory. Instead, you should use `os.path.basename(dir)` to get the name of the current directory.\n\n2. **Filtering Directories**: The line `for directories in os.path.isdir(os.listdir(os.getcwd())):` is incorrect because `os.path.isdir()` expects a single path as an argument, not a list. Instead, use a list comprehension to filter directories.\n\n3. **Updating Path**: When iterating through directories, ensure the path is updated properly to point to each subdirectory.\n\nLet's refine your code:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Set the base directory\nbase_dir = '/home/user/workspace'\nos.chdir(base_dir)\n\n# List all directories in the base directory\nall_subdirs = [d for d in os.listdir(base_dir) if os.path.isdir(os.path.join(base_dir, d))]\n\n# Iterate through each directory\nfor dirs in all_subdirs:\n    # Construct the full path\n    dir_path = os.path.join(base_dir, dirs)\n    \n    # Change to the directory\n    os.chdir(dir_path)\n    \n    # Get the current directory name\n    current_folder_name = os.path.basename(dir_path)\n    print(current_folder_name)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n- **Base Directory**: We first set the base directory and change into it.\n- **List Comprehension**: We use a list comprehension to create a list of directories within the base directory.\n- **Correct Directory Name**: Use `os.path.basename()` to get the name of the current directory.\n- **Avoid Splitting**: You don't need to split the path unless you have specific requirements for naming. The `basename` function directly gives you the folder name.\n\nThis code should work as expected and provide you with the names of all directories within the specified base directory."
