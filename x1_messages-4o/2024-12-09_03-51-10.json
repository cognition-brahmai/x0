        "content": "I'm trying to use short-circuit evaluation like Python's \"and\" while storing results of checks. I have multiple expensive functions that return results, and I want to return a tuple of the results of all the checks if all the checks succeed. However, if one check fails I don't want to call the later checks, like the short-circuiting behavior of 'and'. Nesting 'if' statements will get out of hand if there are a lot of checks. How can I get the short-circuit behavior of 'and' while also storing the results for later use? For example, the following code doesn't short-circuit:\n\n```python\ndef check_a():\n    # do something and return the result,\n    # for simplicity, just make it \"A\"\n    return \"A\"\n\ndef check_b():\n    # do something and return the result,\n    # for simplicity, just make it \"B\"\n    return \"B\"\n\na = check_a()\nb = check_b()\nc = check_c()\n\nif a and b and c:\n    return a, b, c\n```\n\nAnd this approach is messy if there are many checks:\n\n```python\nif a:\n   b = check_b()\n\n   if b:\n      c = check_c()\n\n      if c:\n          return a, b, c\n```\n\nIs there a shorter or more efficient way to do this?"

        "content": "To achieve short-circuit evaluation while storing the results of your checks, you can use a combination of a loop and a structured approach to manage the checks. You can create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a function and its name, then iterate over this list to perform the checks. This way, you can maintain short-circuit behavior and store the results efficiently.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef check_a():\n    # Simulate an expensive check\n    return \"A\"\n\ndef check_b():\n    # Simulate an expensive check\n    return \"B\"\n\ndef check_c():\n    # Simulate an expensive check\n    return \"C\"\n\ndef perform_checks():\n    checks = [\n        ('a', check_a),\n        ('b', check_b),\n        ('c', check_c)\n    ]\n\n    results = {}\n\n    for name, check_func in checks:\n        result = check_func()\n        if result:\n            results[name] = result\n        else:\n            # If a check fails, return immediately\n            return None\n\n    # If all checks passed, return the results as a tuple\n    return tuple(results[name] for name in ['a', 'b', 'c'])\n\nresult = perform_checks()\nif result:\n    print(\"All checks passed:\", result)\nelse:\n    print(\"Some check failed\")\n```\n\nIn this approach, each check is only performed if the previous ones have succeeded, thanks to the for loop structure. If any check fails (i.e., returns a falsy value), the function returns `None` immediately, ensuring that no further checks are performed. If all checks succeed, it returns a tuple of the results."
