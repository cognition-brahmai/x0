I encountered this error when using the following code on Python 2.7.11:\n\n```python\nclass Foo(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\nclass Bar(Foo):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n\nBar()\n```\nI managed to make it work by modifying the code as follows:\n\n```python\nclass Foo(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\nclass Bar(Foo):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(Bar, self).__init__()\n\nBar()\n```\nThis makes me think that the syntax is specific to Python 3. Is there a best practice for providing code that's compatible between Python 2.x and 3.x and avoiding this error from happening?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering is indeed related to the differences in how `super()` is used between Python 2 and Python 3. In Python 3, you can use `super()` without any arguments to automatically refer to the superclass, while in Python 2, you must specify both the class and the instance (e.g., `super(Bar, self)`).\n\nTo write code that is compatible with both Python 2.x and 3.x, you can adopt the following best practices:\n\n1. **Use the Explicit `super()` Call**: In Python 2, you should always specify both the class and the instance when calling `super()`, as you've done in your second example. This way, the code will work in both Python 2 and 3.\n\n    ```python\n    class Foo(object):\n        def __init__(self):\n            pass\n\n    class Bar(Foo):\n        def __init__(self):\n            super(Bar, self).__init__()\n\n    Bar()\n    ```\n\n2. **Use the `future` Module**: If you're writing new code and want to maintain compatibility, you can use the `future` module to bring Python 3 features into Python 2 code. This won't directly solve the `super()` syntax issue but helps with other compatibility concerns.\n\n    ```python\n    from __future__ import print_function, division\n    ```\n\n3. **Consider Using Compatibility Libraries**: Libraries like `six` help manage differences between Python 2 and 3. While it doesn't specifically address `super()`, it can help with other common compatibility issues.\n\n4. **Target Python 3**: Given that Python 2 has reached end-of-life as of January 1, 2020, it's a good idea to target Python 3 for new projects if possible. This simplifies your codebase and future-proofs your work.\n\nBy following these practices, you can minimize compatibility issues and make your codebase more robust when dealing with different Python versions."
