        "content": "Sure! Let's break this down into parts to make it easier to understand and implement.\n\n### 1. HTML Page Creation\n\nTo create an HTML page that includes a review of the latest Disney movie, you can structure it as follows:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Disney Movie Review</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Review: Latest Disney Movie</h1>\n    \n    <h2>Movie Poster</h2>\n    <img src=\"path_to_movie_poster.jpg\" alt=\"Movie Poster\" width=\"300\">\n\n    <h2>Trailer</h2>\n    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/trailer_video_id\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n    <h2>Review</h2>\n    <div>\n        <!-- This is where you can include your Markdown review -->\n    </div>\n\n    <h2>Box Office Comparison</h2>\n    <table border=\"1\">\n        <tr>\n            <th>Movie</th>\n            <th>Release Date</th>\n            <th>Box Office</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Latest Disney Movie</td>\n            <td>Release Date</td>\n            <td>$XXX million</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Previous Disney Movie 1</td>\n            <td>Release Date</td>\n            <td>$XXX million</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Previous Disney Movie 2</td>\n            <td>Release Date</td>\n            <td>$XXX million</td>\n        </tr>\n    </table>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### 2.

Creating a Table for Box Office Comparison\n\nIn your HTML, you can use a simple table to compare box office numbers, as shown in the HTML example above.\n\n### 4. Ruby Code for Dynamic Content\n\nIf you want to dynamically generate parts of this HTML page, such as the table, you can use Ruby. Here's a simple Ruby script that could help with generating the table rows:\n\n```ruby\nmovies = [\n  { title: \"Latest Disney Movie\", release_date: \"2023-10-01\", box_office: 500 },\n  { title: \"Previous Disney Movie 1\", release_date: \"2022-08-15\", box_office: 450 },\n  { title: \"Previous Disney Movie 2\", release_date: \"2021-12-20\", box_office: 600 }\n]\n\ntable_rows = movies.map do |movie|\n  \"<tr><td>#{movie[:title]}</td><td>#{movie[:release_date]}</td><td>$#{movie[:box_office]} million</td></tr>\"\nend.join(\"\\n\")\n\nhtml_content = <<-HTML\n<table border=\"1\">\n    <tr>\n        <th>Movie</th>\n        <th>Release Date</th>\n        <th>Box Office</th>\n    </tr>\n    #{table_rows}\n</table>\nHTML\n\nputs html_content\n```\n\nThis script creates an HTML table by iterating over a list of movies and their data. You can integrate this into a larger Ruby web application or use a Ruby script to generate static HTML content for your page."
