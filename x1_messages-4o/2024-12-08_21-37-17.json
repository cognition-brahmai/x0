        "content": "The process you are describing is an \"energy transformation\" or \"energy conversion.\" This involves the transfer of energy from one form to another while adhering to the principle of conservation of energy. In such processes, the total amount of energy within a closed system remains constant, as stipulated by the First Law of Thermodynamics. Examples include the conversion of chemical energy to thermal energy in combustion, or the transformation of electrical energy to mechanical energy in an electric motor."
