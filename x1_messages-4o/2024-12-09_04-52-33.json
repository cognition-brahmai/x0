Here's the code I've been using:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nx = np.arange(1, 5)\nplt.plot(x, x*1.5, label='Normal')\n```\n\nI am running this with Numpy version '1.6.2' and Matplotlib version '1.3.x'. Can anyone help me understand why the label is not appearing in the plot?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing with the label not appearing in your plot is likely due to the fact that you've not invoked the `plt.legend()` function, which is necessary to display the labels on the plot. The `label` parameter in `plt.plot()` only assigns a label to the line; it doesn't display it by itself. To show the legend, you need to add `plt.legend()` after plotting the data.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\nx = np.arange(1, 5)\nplt.plot(x, x*1.5, label='Normal')\nplt.legend()  # Add this line to display the legend\nplt.xlabel('X-axis')  # Optionally add x-axis label\nplt.ylabel('Y-axis')  # Optionally add y-axis label\nplt.title('Sample Plot')  # Optionally add a title\nplt.show()  # Display the plot\n```\n\nIf you add `plt.legend()`, it should display the legend with the label 'Normal' on your plot.\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that you are using very old versions of NumPy and Matplotlib. If possible, consider updating them to more recent versions to take advantage of improved features and bug fixes. You can update them using the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade numpy matplotlib\n```\n\nThis should help in resolving potential compatibility issues and provide you with more functionality and stability."
