        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the deprecation of the `pip search` command, which relied on an XML-RPC API that has been disabled due to high load. As a result, this command no longer works. Here are some alternatives you can use to search for Python packages:\n\n1. **Use the PyPI website:**\n   You can manually search for packages directly on the Python Package Index (PyPI) website: [https://pypi.org](https://pypi.org). This is the most straightforward way to search for packages and view their details.\n\n2. **Use a third-party tool:**\n   There are tools like `yolk3k` that can be used to search for packages. You can install it using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install yolk3k\n   ```\n   And use it to search for packages:\n   ```bash\n   yolk -V pdbx\n   ```\n\n3. **Use the JSON API:**\n   You can use the PyPI JSON API to programmatically search for packages. Here's an example using Python's `requests` library:\n   ```python\n   import requests\n\n   query = \"pdbx\"\n   response = requests.get(f\"https://pypi.org/pypi/{query}/json\")\n\n   if response.status_code == 200:\n       data = response.json()\n       print(f\"Package Name: {data['info']['name']}\")\n       print(f\"Summary: {data['info']['summary']}\")\n   else:\n       print(\"Package not found.\")\n   ```\n\n4. **Use `pip` to install directly:**\n   If you already know the package name and want to install it, you can directly use the `pip install` command:\n   ```bash\n   pip install pdbx\n   ```\n\nThese methods should help you manage Python packages effectively despite the deprecation of `pip search`."
