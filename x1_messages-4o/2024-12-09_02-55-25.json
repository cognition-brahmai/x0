This means I want the dates in reverse order but the strings in their natural order. I'm having trouble doing this with the new key function that has replaced the old cmp function in recent versions of Python. For numbers, I can easily subtract them from something, but how can I do this for dates and strings? While I'm aware of `functools.cmp_to_key()`, it is described as a transitional tool for programs being converted to Python 3, where comparison functions are not supported. How can I achieve this with the key method?"

        "content": "To achieve sorting with a mix of descending and ascending order using the `key` function in Python, you can utilize tuple-based sorting. This approach involves creating a tuple for each element where each part of the tuple represents a field, and the order of the fields in the tuple determines the sort order.\n\nFor your specific case, where you want to sort by dates in descending order but strings in their natural (ascending) order, you can do the following:\n\n1. **Reverse the date order**: By using the negative of a timestamp or reversing the date in a way that makes it sort in descending order naturally.\n2. **Natural order for strings**: Strings will naturally sort in ascending order, so you don't need to modify them.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Sample data\ndata = [\n    {'date': datetime(2023, 10, 5), 'name': 'Alice'},\n    {'date': datetime(2023, 10, 3), 'name': 'Bob'},\n    {'date': datetime(2023, 10, 5), 'name': 'Charlie'},\n    {'date': datetime(2023, 10, 2), 'name': 'David'},\n]\n\n# Sort function\nsorted_data = sorted(data, key=lambda x: (-x['date'].timestamp(), x['name']))\n\n# Print results\nfor item in sorted_data:\n    print(item)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`x['date'].timestamp()`**: Converts the date to a Unix timestamp. This is a numerical representation which can be easily negated to reverse the order.\n- **`-x['date'].timestamp()`**: Negates the timestamp to achieve descending order for dates.\n- **`x['name']`**: Keeps the natural order for names (strings).\n\n### Notes:\n\n- Ensure that all dates are valid `datetime` objects, which support the `.timestamp()` method.\n- By using tuples, Python sorts by the first element, and if they are equal, it moves to the next element in the tuple. Thus, with `(-x['date'].timestamp(), x['name'])`, it sorts by date descending, and then by name ascending.\n\nThis approach efficiently combines multiple levels of sorting with different orders using the `key` parameter."
