The function code is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef text_from_tagged_ngram(ngram): \n    if type(ngram) == tuple:\n        return ngram[0]\n    return \" \".join(zip(*ngram)[0]) # zip(*ngram)[0] returns a tuple with words from a (word,tag) list\n```\n\nThis function was working well in Python 2.7, but when I try to run it in Python 3.4, I receive an error on the line `return \" \".join(list[zip(*ngram)[0]])`. The error message is `TypeError: 'zip' object is not subscriptable`. Can someone help me resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that, in Python 3, the `zip()` function returns an iterator instead of a list as it did in Python 2. This means you can't directly access elements of the result of `zip()` using indexing like you could in Python 2.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to convert the `zip` object to a list so that you can perform operations like accessing elements or unpacking it. Here's how you can modify your function to work in Python 3:\n\n```python\ndef text_from_tagged_ngram(ngram): \n    if type(ngram) == tuple:\n        return ngram[0]\n    # Convert the zip object to a list and then unpack it\n    return \" \".join(list(zip(*ngram))[0])\n\n# Example usage\nngram = [('word1', 'tag1'), ('word2', 'tag2')]\nprint(text_from_tagged_ngram(ngram))  # Output: \"word1 word2\"\n```\n\nIn this updated version, `list(zip(*ngram))` converts the `zip` object into a list, and then you can access its first element `[0]` which contains the words. This should work correctly in Python 3."
