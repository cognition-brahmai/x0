        "content": "In a geometric sequence, the nth term is found using the formula:\n\n\\[ a_n = a_1 \\times r^{(n-1)} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( a_n \\) is the nth term.\n- \\( a_1 \\) is the first term.\n- \\( r \\) is the common ratio.\n- \\( n \\) is the term number.\n\nTo find the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence, the formula is:\n\n\\[ S_n = a_1 \\times \\frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( S_n \\) is the sum of the first n terms.\n\nGiven that the first term \\( a_1 = 3 \\) and the common ratio \\( r = 2 \\), and you're interested in finding the 5th term and ensuring the sum of the first n terms is greater than 100, let's work through the example:\n\n1. **Finding the 5th Term:**\n\n   \\[\n   a_5 = 3 \\times 2^{(5-1)} = 3 \\times 2^4 = 3 \\times 16 = 48\n   \\]\n\n2. **Sum of the First n Terms Greater Than 100:**\n\n   We need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that:\n\n   \\[\n   S_n = 3 \\times \\frac{2^n - 1}{2 - 1} > 100\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying, we get:\n\n   \\[\n   3 \\times (2^n - 1) > 100\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 2^n - 3 > 100\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3 \\times 2^n > 103\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2^n > \\frac{103}{3} \\approx 34.33\n   \\]\n\n   Solving for \\( n \\), we need the smallest integer \\( n \\) such that \\( 2^n > 34.33 \\).\n\n   - \\( 2^5 = 32 \\)\n   - \\( 2^6 = 64 \\)\n\n   Thus, \\( n = 6 \\) is the smallest integer satisfying the condition.\n\nSo, the 5th term of the sequence is 48, and the sum of the first 6 terms is the smallest sum that exceeds 100."
