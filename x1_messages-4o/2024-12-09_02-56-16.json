Currently, when I open the file in Excel, all the data is shown in one row. The array \"testLabels\" is of the form:\n\n```python\narray(['deer', 'airplane', 'dog', ..., 'frog', 'cat', 'truck'], dtype='<S10')\n```\nAnd the code I use to write to the csv is:\n\n```python\nimport csv\nresultFile = open(\"/filepath\",'wb')\nwr = csv.writer(resultFile)\nwr.writerows([testLabels])\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the way you're passing the `testLabels` array to the `writerows()` method. The `writerows()` method expects an iterable of iterables, and since you're passing `[testLabels]`, it's treating it as a single row with multiple columns rather than multiple rows with a single column.\n\nTo write each element of `testLabels` as a separate row in the CSV file, you should iterate over `testLabels` and write each element individually. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve that:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\n# Open the file in write mode and use 'w' for text mode\nwith open(\"/filepath\", 'w', newline='') as resultFile:\n    wr = csv.writer(resultFile)\n    \n    # Iterate over testLabels and write each element as a separate row\n    for label in testLabels:\n        wr.writerow([label.decode('utf-8')])  # Decode byte strings to regular strings\n\n# No need to explicitly close the file when using 'with open'\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n- **Open the file in text mode (`'w'`)**: When dealing with CSV files, it's better to open them in text mode. Using `'wb'` is not necessary in Python 3.\n- **Use `writerow()` instead of `writerows()`**: This method writes a single row at a time.\n- **Decode byte strings**: Since your array elements are of type `<S10` (byte strings), use `decode('utf-8')` to convert them to regular strings before writing.\n\nThis should result in each element of `testLabels` being written to a separate row in the CSV file."
