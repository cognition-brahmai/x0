When I try to use the class methods as properties, I get a 'classmethod' object is not callable error. The code I am using is:\n\n```python\nclass Foo(object):\n    _var = 5\n    @classmethod\n    def getvar(cls):\n        return cls._var\n    @classmethod\n    def setvar(cls, value):\n        cls._var = value\n    var = property(getvar, setvar)\n```\nWhen I try to demonstrate the class methods, it works fine, but they don't work as properties as shown below:\n```python\nf = Foo()\nf.getvar()\n# output: 5\nf.setvar(4)\nf.getvar()\n# output: 4\nf.var\n# error: TypeError: 'classmethod' object is not callable\nf.var=5\n# error: TypeError: 'classmethod' object is not callable\n```\nIs it possible to use the `property()` function with `@classmethod` decorated functions?"

        "content": "In Python, the `property()` function is designed to work with instance methods, not class methods. The `property()` function creates a property attribute that can be accessed like an instance attribute, but behind the scenes, it calls the getter, setter, and deleter methods. Since `property()` works with instance methods, it doesn't directly support class methods.\n\nHowever, you can achieve similar functionality for class attributes by using a custom descriptor or by using the `property()` function in conjunction with a metaclass. Here's how you can implement it using a custom descriptor:\n\n```python\nclass ClassProperty:\n    def __init__(self, fget=None, fset=None):\n        self.fget = fget\n        self.fset = fset\n\n    def __get__(self, obj, objtype=None):\n        if self.fget is None:\n            raise AttributeError(\"unreadable attribute\")\n        return self.fget(objtype)\n\n    def __set__(self, obj, value):\n        if self.fset is None:\n            raise AttributeError(\"can't set attribute\")\n        self.fset(type(obj), value)\n\nclass Foo:\n    _var = 5\n\n    @classmethod\n    def getvar(cls):\n        return cls._var\n\n    @classmethod\n    def setvar(cls, value):\n        cls._var = value\n\n    var = ClassProperty(getvar, setvar)\n\n# Usage\nf = Foo()\nprint(f.var)  # Output: 5\nf.var = 4\nprint(f.var)  # Output: 4\n```\n\nIn this example, `ClassProperty` is a custom descriptor that mimics the behavior of `property()` but is designed to work with class methods. This allows you to treat class-level attributes as properties, using class methods as the getter and setter."
