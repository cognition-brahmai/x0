How can I accomplish the same task using regular expressions in Python? Is there a more efficient or pythonic way to do this?"

        "content": "You can achieve the same functionality in Python using the `re` module, which provides support for regular expressions. The Python equivalent of the Perl regular expression you provided would look like this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef insert_newline_every_64_chars(text):\n    return re.sub(r'(.{64})', r'\\1\\n', text)\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_text = \"Your string here that you want to insert newlines into every 64 characters.\"\nresult = insert_newline_every_64_chars(input_text)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code uses the `re.sub()` function to replace every 64 characters with those same characters followed by a newline (`\\n`). The pattern `(.{64})` captures any sequence of 64 characters, and `\\1` in the replacement string refers to this captured group.\n\nAlternatively, a more Pythonic way without using regular expressions would be to use list comprehension and the `join()` method:\n\n```python\ndef insert_newline_every_64_chars(text):\n    return '\\n'.join(text[i:i+64] for i in range(0, len(text), 64))\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_text = \"Your string here that you want to insert newlines into every 64 characters.\"\nresult = insert_newline_every_64_chars(input_text)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis approach splits the string into chunks of 64 characters using a list comprehension and then joins them with a newline character. Both methods are effective, but the second method might be more readable and efficient for those familiar with Python's string manipulation capabilities."
