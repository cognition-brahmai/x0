I am trying to understand the difference between T = TypeVar(\"T\", bound=Union[A, B]) and T = TypeVar(\"T\", A, B, covariant=True). While my understanding of the first expression is clear, I am struggling with the second one. I have tried playing around with mypy, but can't seem to figure it out. Here's some sample code for reference:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Union, TypeVar, Generic\n\nclass A: pass\n\nclass ASub(A): pass\n\nclass B: pass\n\n# Case 1... Success: no issues found\n# T = TypeVar(\"T\", bound=Union[A, B])\n\n# Case 2... error: Value of type variable \"T\" of \"SomeGeneric\" cannot be \"ASub\"\nT = TypeVar(\"T\", A, B, covariant=True)\n\nclass SomeGeneric(Generic[T]): pass\n\nclass SomeGenericASub(SomeGeneric[ASub]): pass\n```\n\nWhen I use mypy, I get an error for case 2. Can anyone explain what this means?"

        "content": "To understand the difference between the two `TypeVar` declarations and why you're getting an error with the second one, let's break down each part:\n\n1. **Case 1: `T = TypeVar(\"T\", bound=Union[A, B])`**\n\n   This declares a type variable `T` that can be any type that is a subtype of `Union[A, B]`. In simpler terms, `T` can be either `A`, `B`, or any subclass of `A` or `B`. This is why `SomeGeneric[ASub]` works without any issues, as `ASub` is a subclass of `A`, and thus a valid subtype of `Union[A, B]`.\n\n2. **Case 2: `T = TypeVar(\"T\", A, B, covariant=True)`**\n\n   Here, `T` is a covariant type variable that is constrained to be either `A` or `B`. Covariance allows the type to be more specific, which means a `SomeGeneric[ASub]` is not allowed because `ASub` is not exactly `A` or `B`. Covariant type variables do not allow for subtypes beyond the constraints specified (in this case, `A` or `B`).\n\n   The `covariant=True` means that if a type `SomeGeneric[ASub]` is expected, you could provide `SomeGeneric[A]` instead because `A` is a superclass of `ASub`. However, `ASub` itself is not allowed as a direct type for `T` because it's not exactly `A` or `B`.\n\n### Why the Error?\n\nThe error you see with `SomeGenericASub(SomeGeneric[ASub])` is due to the fact that `T` is constrained to only `A` or `B`, not any subclasses thereof. Since `ASub` is neither `A` nor `B`, it does not satisfy the constraints of the type variable `T`.\n\n### How to Fix the Error?\n\nIf you want `SomeGeneric` to accept `ASub`, you can use the bound approach from Case 1, or you can remove the constraints in Case 2 if your use case allows flexibility beyond just `A` and `B`:\n\n```python\nT = TypeVar(\"T\", bound=A)  # If you want to focus only on subclasses of A\n# or simply\nT = TypeVar(\"T\", covariant=True)  # Allow any type, with covariant behavior\n```\n\nThese adjustments should allow `SomeGeneric[ASub]` without issues, depending on your specific requirements for type behavior."
