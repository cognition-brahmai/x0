I currently have a basic algorithm, which is quite slow, that generates divisors by iterating over numbers from 1 to half of the input number and checking the remainder when the input number is divided by the current number. I also have a different generator for finding prime factors and their multiplicities, but I am not sure how useful it is for this problem. I would like to find a more efficient algorithm to generate divisors.\n\nHere is the basic divisor generator:\n\n```python\ndef divisorGenerator(n):\n    for i in xrange(1,n/2+1):\n        if n%i == 0: yield i\n    yield n\n```\n\nAnd here is the prime factor generator:\n\n```python\nfor i in factorGenerator(100):\n    print i\n```\n\nIt gives output like this:\n\n```python\n(2, 2)\n(5, 2)\n```\n\nBut I would like to get output like this:\n\n```python\nfor i in divisorGen(100):\n    print i\n```\n\nWhich would yield:\n\n```python\n1\n2\n4\n5\n10\n20\n25\n50\n100\n```"

        "content": "To generate all divisors of a number efficiently, you can leverage the prime factorization of the number. Your existing prime factor generator can be quite useful here. Once you have the prime factorization of a number, you can use it to generate all possible combinations of factors, which will give you all the divisors.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can modify your existing code to achieve this:\n\n1. Use the prime factor generator to get the prime factors and their multiplicities.\n2. Generate all divisors from the prime factors and their powers.\n\nHere's a complete example:\n\n```python\ndef factorGenerator(n):\n    i = 2\n    while i * i <= n:\n        count = 0\n        while (n % i) == 0:\n            n //= i\n            count += 1\n        if count > 0:\n            yield (i, count)\n        i += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        yield (n, 1)\n\ndef divisorGenerator(n):\n    prime_factors = list(factorGenerator(n))\n    \n    def generateDivisors(factors, index=0):\n        if index == len(factors):\n            yield 1\n        else:\n            prime, power = factors[index]\n            for divisor in generateDivisors(factors, index + 1):\n                current = 1\n                for _ in range(power + 1):\n                    yield current * divisor\n                    current *= prime\n    \n    for divisor in sorted(generateDivisors(prime_factors)):\n        yield divisor\n\n# Example usage:\nfor divisor in divisorGenerator(100):\n    print(divisor)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **factorGenerator Function**: This function generates the prime factors of a number along with their multiplicities.\n\n2. **divisorGenerator Function**:\n   - First, it retrieves the prime factors using `factorGenerator`.\n   - `generateDivisors` is a recursive function that generates all possible products of the prime factors raised to their respective powers, thus generating all divisors.\n   - Finally, the divisors are sorted and yielded one by one.\n\nThis approach efficiently generates all divisors by leveraging the prime factorization, which reduces the number of iterations compared to checking every number up to `n/2`."
