        "content": "To modify the axis style in Matplotlib and remove the top and right spines (axes), you can use the `spines` attribute of the Axes object. The `spines` attribute is a dictionary with keys 'top', 'right', 'bottom', and 'left', corresponding to each of the four spines of the plot. You can set the visibility of these spines to `False` for the ones you want to remove.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Create a sample plot\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\n# Plot some data\nax.plot([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 4, 2, 3])\n\n# Remove the top and right spines\nax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)\nax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)\n\n# Optional: You may also want to move the ticks to the bottom and left only\nax.xaxis.set_ticks_position('bottom')\nax.yaxis.set_ticks_position('left')\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis will create a plot where only the left and bottom spines are visible, giving it a cleaner look. You can customize further by adjusting other properties of the spines or ticks as needed."
