        "content": "The error you're encountering typically arises because the `attr` library you're trying to use has been superseded by the `attrs` library, which is a more up-to-date and widely used implementation. The `attr` library does not have the `s` decorator, but the `attrs` library does. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure you have the correct library installed**: You should be using the `attrs` library. To ensure that you have it installed, you can use the following pip command:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install attrs\n   ```\n\n2. **Modify your import statement**: Change your import statement from `import attr` to `import attrs`:\n\n   ```python\n   import attrs\n\n   @attrs.s\n   class SmartClass(object):\n       a = attrs.ib()\n       b = attrs.ib()\n   ```\n\n3. **Alternatively, use the correct import from attrs**: You can also directly import the specific functions from `attrs`:\n\n   ```python\n   from attrs import define, field\n\n   @define\n   class SmartClass:\n       a = field()\n       b = field()\n   ```\n\nBy using the `attrs` library and adjusting your imports accordingly, your code should work without encountering the `AttributeError`."
