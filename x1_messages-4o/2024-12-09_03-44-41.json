I have a simple implementation using + and * operations by tiling the original tensor, however, due to large batch and high dimensional features, replicating the tensor consumes a lot of memory. I'm looking for an alternative way to implement this, possibly by double looping the original tensor. Here's my current code:\n\n```python\ndef pairwise_l2_norm2(x, y, scope=None):\n    with tf.op_scope([x, y], scope, 'pairwise_l2_norm2'):\n        size_x = tf.shape(x)[0]\n        size_y = tf.shape(y)[0]\n        xx = tf.expand_dims(x, -1)\n        xx = tf.tile(xx, tf.pack([1, 1, size_y]))\n\n        yy = tf.expand_dims(y, -1)\n        yy = tf.tile(yy, tf.pack([1, 1, size_x]))\n        yy = tf.transpose(yy, perm=[2, 1, 0])\n\n        diff = tf.sub(xx, yy)\n        square_diff = tf.square(diff)\n\n        square_dist = tf.reduce_sum(square_diff, 1)\n\n        return square_dist\n```\n\nThis function takes two matrices of size (m,d) and (n,d) as input and computes the squared distance between each row vector. The output is a matrix of size (m,n) with element 'd_ij = dist(x_i, y_j)'."

        "content": "To compute pairwise square distances efficiently without replicating tensors and increasing memory usage, you can leverage broadcasting and matrix operations instead of tiling. Here's an alternative approach using TensorFlow:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ndef pairwise_l2_norm2(x, y, scope=None):\n    with tf.name_scope(scope or 'pairwise_l2_norm2'):\n        # Compute the squared norms of each row in x and y\n        x_norm = tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(x), axis=1, keepdims=True)\n        y_norm = tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(y), axis=1, keepdims=True)\n\n        # Compute the dot product between x and y\n        xy = tf.matmul(x, y, transpose_b=True)\n\n        # Use the formula (x-y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 2*x*y\n        # Broadcasting is used here for efficient computation\n        square_dist = x_norm - 2 * xy + tf.transpose(y_norm)\n\n        # Ensure the result is non-negative due to numerical errors\n        square_dist = tf.maximum(square_dist, 0.0)\n\n        return square_dist\n\n# Example usage\nx = tf.random.normal((m, d))\ny = tf.random.normal((n, d))\nsquare_distances = pairwise_l2_norm2(x, y)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Squared Norms**: Compute the squared L2 norm of each row in `x` and `y` using `tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(x), axis=1, keepdims=True)`. This gives you a column vector for `x` and `y`.\n\n2. **Dot Product**: Calculate the dot product between `x` and `y` using `tf.matmul(x, y, transpose_b=True)`. The result is a matrix where each element represents the dot product between a row in `x` and a row in `y`.\n\n3. **Distance Calculation**: Use the identity \\((x-y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 2xy\\) to compute the squared distances. This calculation leverages broadcasting to avoid tiling or looping operations.\n\n4. **Non-Negative Correction**: Use `tf.maximum(square_dist, 0.0)` to ensure numerical stability, preventing negative values due to floating-point precision issues.\n\nThis approach is efficient in terms of memory and computational resources, as it avoids explicit replication of the input tensors."
