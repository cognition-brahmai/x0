I have gone through the DynamoDB API but I couldn't find any method that can tell me this information. What is the best way to handle this issue?

        "content": "To determine if a table already exists in DynamoDB using Boto3, you don't need to attempt creating the table and catch exceptions. Instead, you can list all the tables and check if your desired table is among them. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using `list_tables()` Method**: This method will return a list of all table names in your DynamoDB. You can then check if your table is present in this list.\n\nHere is an example of how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport boto3\n\ndef check_table_exists(table_name):\n    # Create a DynamoDB client\n    dynamodb = boto3.client('dynamodb')\n\n    # Get the list of table names\n    try:\n        response = dynamodb.list_tables()\n        table_names = response.get('TableNames', [])\n        \n        # Check if the desired table exists\n        if table_name in table_names:\n            print(f\"Table '{table_name}' exists.\")\n            return True\n        else:\n            print(f\"Table '{table_name}' does not exist.\")\n            return False\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        return False\n\n# Example usage\ntable_name = 'YourTableName'\ncheck_table_exists(table_name)\n```\n\n2. **Using `describe_table()` Method**: Another way is to attempt to describe the table. If the table exists, you will get the table details, otherwise, it will raise a `ResourceNotFoundException`.\n\nHere is how you can do it using `describe_table()`:\n\n```python\nimport boto3\nfrom botocore.exceptions import ClientError\n\ndef check_table_exists(table_name):\n    # Create a DynamoDB client\n    dynamodb = boto3.client('dynamodb')\n\n    try:\n        # Attempt to describe the table\n        response = dynamodb.describe_table(TableName=table_name)\n        print(f\"Table '{table_name}' exists.\")\n        return True\n\n    except ClientError as e:\n        # Check if the exception is because the table does not exist\n        if e.response['Error']['Code'] == 'ResourceNotFoundException':\n            print(f\"Table '{table_name}' does not exist.\")\n            return False\n        else:\n            # Raise the exception if it's any other error\n            raise\n\n# Example usage\ntable_name = 'YourTableName'\ncheck_table_exists(table_name)\n```\n\nBoth approaches are valid, but using `describe_table()` can be more direct and efficient if you are checking for the existence of a single table, as it doesn't require listing all tables. Choose the method that best fits your use case."
