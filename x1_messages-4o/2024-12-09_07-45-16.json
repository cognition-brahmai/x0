I am trying to get \"python setup.py test\" to run the equivalent of \"python -m unittest discover\" without using a run_tests.py script or any external test tools such as nose or py.test. I am trying to find a solution that only works on python 2.7. I am thinking of adding something to the test_suite and/or test_loader fields in the config of setup.py, but I can't find a working combination. Is this possible using only unittest built into python 2.7? My project structure is as follows:\n\n```\nproject/\n  package/\n    __init__.py\n    module.py\n  tests/\n    __init__.py\n    test_module.py\n  run_tests.py <- I want to delete this\n  setup.py\n```\n\nI know this is possible with unittest2 but I want to find an equivalent solution using only unittest. I am currently using a script called run_tests.py, but I am hoping to remove this by moving to a solution that only uses \"python setup.py test\". Here is the run_tests.py script I am hoping to remove:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n\n    # use the default shared TestLoader instance\n    test_loader = unittest.defaultTestLoader\n\n    # use the basic test runner that outputs to sys.stderr\n    test_runner = unittest.TextTestRunner()\n\n    # automatically discover all tests in the current dir of the form test*.py\n    # NOTE: only works for python 2.7 and later\n    test_suite = test_loader.discover('.')\n\n    # run the test suite\n    test_runner.run(test_suite)\n```"

        "content": "To achieve your goal of running `unittest discover` using `python setup.py test` without relying on an external script like `run_tests.py` or any external testing tools, you can utilize the `setuptools` library. This involves customizing the `setup.py` file to specify the test suite and loader.\n\nHere's a step-by-step solution using Python 2.7:\n\n1. **Ensure you have `setuptools` installed**: It should be included with Python, but you can install or upgrade it using `pip install --upgrade setuptools` if needed.\n\n2. **Modify your `setup.py`**: You'll need to define a custom command class to override the default behavior of `python setup.py test` so that it performs test discovery.\n\nHere's how you can modify your `setup.py`:\n\n```python\nfrom setuptools import setup, Command\nimport unittest\n\nclass TestCommand(Command):\n    user_options = []\n\n    def initialize_options(self):\n        pass\n\n    def finalize_options(self):\n        pass\n\n    def run(self):\n        # Discover and run tests\n        test_loader = unittest.defaultTestLoader\n        test_suite = test_loader.discover('tests')\n        test_runner = unittest.TextTestRunner()\n        result = test_runner.run(test_suite)\n        if not result.wasSuccessful():\n            raise SystemExit(1)\n\nsetup(\n    name='YourProjectName',\n    version='0.1',\n    packages=['package'],\n    test_suite='tests',\n    cmdclass={'test': TestCommand},\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Custom TestCommand Class**: This class extends `Command` from `setuptools` and overrides the `run` method to perform test discovery using `unittest`.\n- **test_loader.discover('tests')**: This discovers tests within the `tests` directory.\n- **test_runner.run(test_suite)**: This runs the discovered tests.\n- **Raise SystemExit(1)**: If the tests fail, this ensures the script exits with a non-zero status, indicating failure.\n\n3. **Run Tests**: Now you can run your tests with the following command:\n\n```bash\npython setup.py test\n```\n\nThis setup will automatically discover and run all test cases in files matching the pattern `test*.py` within the `tests` directory."
