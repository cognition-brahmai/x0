        "content": "To obtain the sum of multiple `timedelta` objects in Python, you can simply use the `sum()` function combined with a starting value of `timedelta(0)`. The `timedelta` class is part of the `datetime` module, so you'll need to import it first. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\n# Create several timedelta objects\ntd1 = timedelta(days=2, hours=5)\ntd2 = timedelta(hours=8, minutes=30)\ntd3 = timedelta(days=1, minutes=45)\n\n# List of timedelta objects\ntimedeltas = [td1, td2, td3]\n\n# Sum the timedelta objects\ntotal_timedelta = sum(timedeltas, timedelta(0))\n\nprint(\"Total timedelta:\", total_timedelta)\n```\n\nIn this example, `timedelta(0)` is used as the starting value for the `sum()` function, which ensures that the summation starts from zero. This approach will give you the total time duration represented by the sum of all the `timedelta` objects in the list."
