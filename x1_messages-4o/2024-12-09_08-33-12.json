        "content": "Yes, there are more Pythonic ways to check if a function returns `False`. You can directly use the `not` operator, or simply rely on the truthiness of the returned value. Here are a couple of alternative approaches:\n\n1. Using `not`:\n   ```python\n   if not user_can_read(request.user, b):\n   ```\n   This checks if the result of `user_can_read(request.user, b)` is `False` or evaluates to `False`.\n\n2. Direct comparison (though `not` is generally preferred for readability):\n   ```python\n   if user_can_read(request.user, b) is False:\n   ```\n   This explicitly checks if the return value is exactly `False`. It is more strict than the first option, as it will not pass for other falsy values like `None`, `0`, or `[]`.\n\nUsing the `not` operator is usually recommended for its simplicity and readability, especially when you want to consider all falsy values (`None`, `0`, `[]`, etc.) as `False`."
