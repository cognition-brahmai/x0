I tried using the following code: \n```python\ntimedelta(\"PT1H5M26S\", \"T%H%M%S\")\n```\nHowever, it does not work. Is there a simple way to achieve this conversion? For reference, a timedelta object in Python represents a duration, the difference between two dates or times (https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.timedelta) and ISO 8601 durations are described here: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations)."

        "content": "To convert an ISO 8601 duration string into a `datetime.timedelta` object in Python, you can use the `isodate` library, which provides support for parsing ISO 8601 date, time, and duration formats. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install isodate\n```\n\nOnce installed, you can use the `isodate.parse_duration` function to convert the ISO 8601 duration string into a `timedelta` object. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport isodate\n\n# ISO 8601 duration string\nduration_str = \"PT1H5M26S\"\n\n# Convert to timedelta\nduration = isodate.parse_duration(duration_str)\n\nprint(duration)\n```\n\nThis code will correctly parse the ISO 8601 duration string `\"PT1H5M26S\"` and convert it into a `timedelta` object representing 1 hour, 5 minutes, and 26 seconds."
