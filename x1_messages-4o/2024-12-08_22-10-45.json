However, there's a catch! You have to find the three largest integers without using any sorting algorithms. Can you write a Java program that can solve this puzzle and have a time complexity of O(nlog(k)) where n is the size of the input array and k is the size of the priority queue? Here is the starter code to get you started:\nimport java.util.*;\npublic class ThreeLargestIntegers {\n    public static int[] findThreeLargestIntegers(int[] nums) {\n        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();\n        for (int num : nums) {\n            // TODO: Add code here to find the three largest integers\n        }\n        // TODO: Add code here to return the array of three largest integers\n    }\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int[] nums = {4, 2, 9, 7, 5, 8};\n        int[] result = findThreeLargestIntegers(nums);\n        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(result));\n    }\n} \nGood luck and happy coding!"

        "content": "Certainly! To find the three largest integers using a `PriorityQueue` with a time complexity of \\(O(n \\log(k))\\), we can utilize a min-heap approach. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n1. Maintain a min-heap of size 3. This will store the three largest numbers.\n2. As you iterate through the array, add each number to the heap.\n3. If the heap size exceeds 3, remove the smallest element, ensuring that only the three largest numbers remain.\n4. Finally, convert the heap to an array to return the result.\n\nHere's the complete Java program:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.*;\n\npublic class ThreeLargestIntegers {\n    public static int[] findThreeLargestIntegers(int[] nums) {\n        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(3);\n\n        for (int num : nums) {\n            pq.offer(num);\n            if (pq.size() > 3) {\n                pq.poll();  // Remove the smallest element\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Since PriorityQueue doesn't maintain order, we need to convert it to an array\n        int[] result = new int[3];\n        int index = 2;\n        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {\n            result[index--] = pq.poll();\n        }\n\n        return result;\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int[] nums = {4, 2, 9, 7, 5, 8};\n        int[] result = findThreeLargestIntegers(nums);\n        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(result));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **PriorityQueue Initialization**: The `PriorityQueue` is initialized with a capacity of 3, which is the number of largest elements we want to retain.\n- **Adding Elements**: For each element in the array, we add it to the `PriorityQueue`.\n- **Maintaining Size**: If the size of the `PriorityQueue` exceeds 3, we remove the smallest element using `poll()`. This ensures that the queue always contains the largest elements.\n- **Extracting the Result**: After processing all elements, we extract elements from the `PriorityQueue` into an array. Since it's a min-heap, we fill the result array from the end to ensure the order is correct.\n\nThis approach efficiently finds the three largest numbers in the array with a time complexity of \\(O(n \\log(3))\\), which simplifies to \\(O(n)\\) given that 3 is a constant."
