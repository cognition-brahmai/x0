I've tried to increase the spacing by using the `scale` parameter as suggested in a forum post I found. Here's the suggested code:\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nG = nx.path_graph(4)\npos = nx.spring_layout(G)  # default to scale=1\nnx.draw(G, pos)\npos = nx.spring_layout(G, scale=2)  # double distance between all nodes\nnx.draw(G, pos)\n```\n\nHowever, the `scale` parameter does not seem to have any effect. Could you please tell me the correct method to increase the node spacing?"

        "content": "To increase the spacing between nodes in a graph layout using NetworkX's `spring_layout` function, you can adjust several parameters aside from `scale` to achieve the desired effect. Here are a few options you can try:\n\n1. **Adjust the `k` parameter:** The `k` parameter determines the optimal distance between nodes. Increasing its value can result in more spacing between nodes.\n\n2. **Increase the `iterations` parameter:** More iterations can help the layout algorithm to better adjust the positions of nodes to achieve a more optimal layout.\n\n3. **Use the `scale` parameter effectively:** Ensure that the `scale` parameter is used correctly, and note that it affects the overall size of the layout.\n\nHere's an example of how you might apply these parameters:\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Create a graph (you can replace this with your clique graph)\nG = nx.path_graph(4)\n\n# Adjust the layout\npos = nx.spring_layout(G, k=0.5, iterations=50, scale=2)\n\n# Draw the graph\nnx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_size=500, node_color='lightblue', font_size=10)\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- `k=0.5` is used to increase the distance between nodes. You can adjust this value to see how it affects the spacing.\n- `iterations=50` increases the number of iterations, allowing the algorithm more time to settle into an optimal layout.\n- `scale=2` doubles the overall scale of the layout.\n\nFeel free to experiment with these parameters to find the layout that best suits your needs."
