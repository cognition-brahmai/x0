In normal run everything works fine, but when using PyCharm debugger, I am consistently getting two types of exceptions. The first one is related to the 'urlsplit' generator object in 'urllib/parse.py', and the second one is a SystemError stating 'error return without exception set', and it involves the 'iter_slices' generator object in 'requests/utils.py'. This problem is not specific to a single project, as I've encountered it multiple times across various multi-threaded projects. However, I don't face this issue when not using the debugger. Despite these exceptions, the application remains stable and functions correctly. Why is this happening and is there a way to suppress these exceptions so they don't clutter my logs?"

        "content": "The issues you're encountering with exceptions during debugging in PyCharm are not uncommon, especially when using the debugger with multi-threaded applications. Let's break down the two main concerns and explore potential solutions:\n\n### Explanation of Exceptions\n\n1. **'urlsplit' Generator Object in `urllib/parse.py`:**\n   - This exception is often related to how the debugger interacts with generator objects. PyCharm\u2019s debugger may attempt to inspect or evaluate the state of generators, which can lead to these exceptions being raised, even though they do not affect the actual execution when running normally.\n\n2. **SystemError: 'error return without exception set' in `requests/utils.py`:**\n   - This is a known issue with some versions of Python and the `requests` library when interacting with PyCharm's debugger. It is often related to the way the debugger handles certain internal state during execution, particularly with multi-threaded code, which may inadvertently trigger this error.\n\n### Solutions\n\n1. **Upgrade Your Environment:**\n   - Consider upgrading both Python and the `requests` library to newer versions. Python 3.6 and `requests` 2.18.4 are quite outdated, and later versions may have resolved these specific debugger interaction issues.\n   - Update PyCharm to the latest version as well, since newer versions may have improved handling of debugging scenarios like yours.\n\n2. **Adjust Debugger Settings:**\n   - In PyCharm, you can adjust the debugger settings to minimize its interference with generator objects and threads. Go to `Preferences` > `Build, Execution, Deployment` > `Debugger`, and try tweaking settings related to \"Gevent compatible\" or \"Asyncio\" support, if applicable.\n\n3. **Suppress Specific Exceptions:**\n   - Unfortunately, PyCharm does not provide a straightforward way to suppress these specific exceptions through its interface. However, you can use exception breakpoints to manage how exceptions are handled. By default, PyCharm stops on all exceptions; you can configure it to ignore specific exceptions (like `SystemError`) by unchecking them in the \"Exception Breakpoints\" dialog.\n\n4. **Use Logging and Ignore Exceptions:**\n   - If the exceptions are cluttering your logs, you can set up your logging configuration to filter out these specific exceptions. This way, they won't appear in your log outputs.\n\n5. **Explore Alternate Debugging Tools:**\n   - If these issues persist and are disruptive, consider using alternate debugging tools like `pdb`, which may handle these interactions differently.\n\nBy updating your environment, adjusting debugger settings, and configuring logging, you should be able to reduce the impact of these exceptions on your debugging experience."
