The purpose of this code is to check if a number 'n' is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 20. However, my current solution seems inefficient and slow. How can I make this code shorter and more efficient?\n\n```python\n    if n % 2 == 0 and n % 3 == 0 and\\\n       n % 4 == 0 and n % 5 == 0 and\\\n       n % 6 == 0 and n % 7 == 0 and\\\n       n % 8 == 0 and n % 9 == 0 and\\\n       n % 10 == 0 and n % 11 == 0 and\\\n       n % 12 == 0 and n % 13 == 0 and\\\n       n % 14 == 0 and n % 15 == 0 and\\\n       n % 16 == 0 and n % 17 == 0 and\\\n       n % 18 == 0 and n % 19 == 0 and\\\n       n % 20 == 0:\n```"

        "content": "To improve the efficiency and readability of your code, you can utilize a loop to check the divisibility by all numbers from 2 to 20. Additionally, you can take advantage of the fact that if a number is divisible by a larger number, it will automatically be divisible by its factors as well. Here's a more efficient way to write your code:\n\n```python\ndef is_divisible_by_2_to_20(n):\n    for i in range(20, 1, -1):\n        if n % i != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\nThis function starts checking from 20 down to 2, which slightly improves efficiency as larger numbers tend to have more divisors. This way, you can determine if `n` is divisible by all numbers from 2 to 20 in a more compact and efficient manner."
