        "content": "To solve this problem, you can create a function that calculates the product of all integers in an array except for the integer at the current index. One efficient way to achieve this without using division is to use prefix and suffix products. Here's a step-by-step guide and Python code implementation for this approach:\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Initialize Arrays**: Create two auxiliary arrays, `prefix_products` and `suffix_products`, both of the same length as the input array. Also, initialize the `result` array.\n\n2. **Compute Prefix Products**: \n   - Traverse the array from left to right.\n   - Fill `prefix_products` such that each element at index `i` contains the product of all elements before index `i`.\n\n3. **Compute Suffix Products**:\n   - Traverse the array from right to left.\n   - Fill `suffix_products` such that each element at index `i` contains the product of all elements after index `i`.\n\n4. **Compute Result**:\n   - Traverse the array and for each index, multiply the corresponding prefix and suffix products to get the result for that index.\n\n### Python Code:\n\n```python\ndef product_except_self(nums):\n    n = len(nums)\n\n    # Initialize the prefix and suffix product arrays\n    prefix_products = [1] * n\n    suffix_products = [1] * n\n    result = [1] * n\n\n    # Fill the prefix_products array\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        prefix_products[i] = prefix_products[i - 1] * nums[i - 1]\n\n    # Fill the suffix_products array\n    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):\n        suffix_products[i] = suffix_products[i + 1] * nums[i + 1]\n\n    # Fill the result array\n    for i in range(n):\n        result[i] = prefix_products[i] * suffix_products[i]\n\n    return result\n\n# Example usage\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4]\noutput = product_except_self(arr)\nprint(output)  # Output: [24, 12, 8, 6]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Prefix Products**: For an index `i`, `prefix_products[i]` holds the product of all elements before `i`. For example, if `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, then `prefix_products = [1, 1, 2, 6]`.\n\n- **Suffix Products**: For an index `i`, `suffix_products[i]` holds the product of all elements after `i`. For the same example, `suffix_products = [24, 12, 4, 1]`.\n\n- **Result**: For each index `i`, the product of all other elements except `nums[i]` is the product of `prefix_products[i]` and `suffix_products[i]`.\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), which is efficient for this problem."
