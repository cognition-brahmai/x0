However, when I execute `mkvirtualenv`, I receive an error: `ERROR: virtualenvwrapper could not find virtualenv in your path`. Initially, I thought it was a `PYTHONPATH` issue. When I perform a `pip show virtualenv`, the output indicates that `virtualenv` is installed and its location is in the `PYTHONPATH`. My `PYTHONPATH` contains the directory where `virtualenv` is located. Also, my `~/.zshrc` file contains appropriate configurations for `virtualenvwrapper`. As `virtualenvwrapper.sh` is written in bash, should I be checking my `PATH` instead of my `PYTHONPATH`? How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering typically stems from the `virtualenv` executable not being in your system's `PATH`, rather than an issue with `PYTHONPATH`. Here are the steps you can follow to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify `virtualenv` Installation:**\n   - Run `which virtualenv` or `command -v virtualenv` in your terminal. This will show you the path to the `virtualenv` executable if it's in your `PATH`.\n   - If it doesn\u2019t return a path, it means `virtualenv` is not in your `PATH`.\n\n2. **Add `virtualenv` to your `PATH`:**\n   - Locate where `virtualenv` is installed. Running `pip show virtualenv` should give you the `Location` of the package.\n   - You can add this directory to your `PATH` by editing your `~/.zshrc` file. For example:\n     ```bash\n     export PATH=\"/path/to/virtualenv/directory:$PATH\"\n     ```\n   - Replace `/path/to/virtualenv/directory` with the actual directory path where `virtualenv` is installed.\n\n3. **Ensure `virtualenvwrapper` is sourced correctly:**\n   - In your `~/.zshrc` file, ensure you have the following lines (adjust paths as necessary):\n     ```bash\n     export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs\n     export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=$(which python3)\n     source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh\n     ```\n   - Make sure the path to `virtualenvwrapper.sh` is correct. You can find out where it is installed using `which virtualenvwrapper.sh`.\n\n4. **Reload your shell configuration:**\n   - After making changes to `~/.zshrc`, reload it with:\n     ```bash\n     source ~/.zshrc\n     ```\n\n5. **Reinstall `virtualenv` if necessary:**\n   - If the above steps don\u2019t resolve the issue, consider reinstalling `virtualenv`:\n     ```bash\n     pip uninstall virtualenv\n     pip install virtualenv\n     ```\n\n6. **Check for Python Version Compatibility:**\n   - Ensure that the version of Python you're using is compatible with your version of `virtualenv`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the error and successfully use `mkvirtualenv` to create virtual environments."
