        "content": "Certainly! You can simplify the process of merging overlapping ranges by sorting the ranges first and then iteratively merging them. Here's a more straightforward solution:\n\n```python\ndef merge_ranges(ranges):\n    # Sort the ranges by their starting point\n    ranges.sort()\n    \n    # Initialize the list to hold merged ranges\n    merged_ranges = []\n    \n    # Start with the first range\n    current_start, current_end = ranges[0]\n\n    for start, end in ranges[1:]:\n        if start <= current_end:  # Overlapping or contiguous ranges\n            current_end = max(current_end, end)\n        else:\n            # No overlap, add the current range to the list\n            merged_ranges.append((current_start, current_end))\n            current_start, current_end = start, end\n\n    # Add the last range\n    merged_ranges.append((current_start, current_end))\n\n    return merged_ranges\n\nranges = [(1, 50), (49, 70), (75, 85), (84, 88), (87, 92)]\nresult = merge_ranges(ranges)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis solution sorts the list of ranges and then iterates through them, merging overlapping or contiguous ranges. The key steps are:\n\n1. **Sorting** the list of ranges by their starting point ensures that we can efficiently process them in order.\n\n2. **Iterating** through the sorted list and checking if the current range overlaps with the last merged range. If they do overlap, we merge them by extending the end of the current range to the maximum end of both overlapping ranges.\n\n3. **Adding** non-overlapping ranges to the result list as individual merged ranges.\n\nThis approach is both efficient and easy to understand. The output will be:\n\n```python\n[(1, 70), (75, 92)]\n```"
