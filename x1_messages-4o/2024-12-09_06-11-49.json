Can you explain how this is different from the existing tf.data.Dataset.map()?"

        "content": "Certainly! In TensorFlow, both `tf.data.Dataset.map()` and `tf.data.Dataset.apply()` are used to transform datasets, but they serve slightly different purposes and offer different levels of flexibility.\n\n### `tf.data.Dataset.map()`\n\n- **Purpose**: The `map()` function is used to apply a transformation function to each element of the dataset individually.\n- **Functionality**: It takes a function as an argument and applies this function to each element of the dataset. This is useful for simple, element-wise transformations.\n- **Example Use Case**: You might use `map()` to apply a normalization function to your dataset or to decode raw image data into a usable format.\n\n```python\ndataset = dataset.map(lambda x: x * 2)\n```\n\n### `tf.data.Dataset.apply()`\n\n- **Purpose**: The `apply()` function is designed to allow more complex, custom transformations that might not be possible with `map()`.\n- **Functionality**: It takes a transformation function that returns a transformed dataset. This allows for more flexibility, such as applying a series of operations or transformations that require more contextual or stateful information than what `map()` can handle.\n- **Example Use Case**: You might use `apply()` to apply a custom batch transformation, shuffle operations, or other more sophisticated transformations that might require a combination of dataset operations.\n\n```python\ndataset = dataset.apply(custom_transformation_fn)\n```\n\n### Key Differences\n\n1. **Granularity**: `map()` operates at the level of individual elements, while `apply()` is intended for transformations that may need to operate on the dataset as a whole or require the application of multiple operations in a sequence.\n\n2. **Complexity**: `map()` is straightforward for simple element-wise operations, whereas `apply()` can be used for more complex transformations that potentially involve multiple steps or additional logic.\n\n3. **Flexibility**: `apply()` provides more flexibility as it can be used to implement custom dataset operations that are not directly supported by other dataset methods.\n\nIn summary, while `map()` is ideal for straightforward transformations applied to each element independently, `apply()` offers a more powerful and flexible interface for implementing complex or multi-step dataset transformations."
