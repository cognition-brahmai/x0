This assumes you have a table named `books` and a column named `publication_year` which stores the year of publication:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM books\nWHERE publication_year > 2000;\n```\n\nThis query selects all columns from the `books` table where the `publication_year` is greater than 2000. Adjust the table and column names as necessary to fit your specific database schema."
