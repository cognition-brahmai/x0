I would like to insert 'import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()' into my code to allow me to debug it. However, I am finding that pytest is trapping sys.stdin/sys.stdout which causes ipdb to fail. How can I successfully use ipdb while testing with pytest? I would like to clarify that I am not interested in jumping to pdb or ipdb after a failure, but I want to place breaks anywhere in the code and be able to debug it there before a failure occurs."

        "content": "To successfully use `ipdb` with `pytest` while avoiding issues with `sys.stdin` and `sys.stdout`, you can use the `--capture` option provided by `pytest` to control its output capturing mechanism. By disabling capturing, you allow `ipdb` to interact with the terminal directly. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Disable Output Capturing**: You can disable output capturing by using the `-s` or `--capture=no` option when running your tests. This prevents `pytest` from capturing the output and allows `ipdb` to interact with the terminal.\n\n   Run your tests like this:\n\n   ```bash\n   pytest -s\n   ```\n\n2. **Insert Breakpoints**: You can insert breakpoints in your code using `import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()`. This will allow you to pause execution and enter the interactive debugging session when that line of code is reached.\n\n3. **Ensure Compatibility**: Make sure that any environment or configurations you are using are compatible with `ipdb` and do not interfere with its operation.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how you might set up your test function:\n\n```python\ndef test_my_function():\n    import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()  # Set a breakpoint here\n    # Your test code goes here\n    assert my_function() == expected_value\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to use `ipdb` to debug your tests interactively without issues."
