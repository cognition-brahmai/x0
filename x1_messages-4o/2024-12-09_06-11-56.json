However, they differ slightly in terms of syntax and readability.\n\n1. **`from matplotlib import pyplot as plt`**:\n   - This statement explicitly imports the `pyplot` module from the `matplotlib` package and assigns it the alias `plt`.\n   - It clearly indicates that only the `pyplot` module is being imported, which can be more readable and explicit about what is being used from the `matplotlib` package.\n\n2. **`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`**:\n   - This statement imports the `pyplot` module using dot notation, directly from the `matplotlib` package and assigns it the alias `plt`.\n   - This approach is common and widely used in the Python community for importing `pyplot`, and many examples and tutorials use this format, so it might be more familiar to others.\n\nIn terms of coding practice, both are acceptable, but `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` is more commonly seen in the community. This common usage can make your code easier for others to understand and maintain, as it aligns with widely adopted conventions. However, choosing either depends on your preference for clarity and consistency in your codebase."
