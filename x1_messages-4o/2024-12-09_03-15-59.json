In a tutorial I'm following, the neural network generates a one-hot vector as its output. However, the labels in the example are not in one-hot vector format. When I check their size, I get `torch.Size([4])` for labels and `torch.Size([4, 10])` for outputs. Despite this, when I pass the outputs and labels to the `CrossEntropyLoss()` function, I do not get an error. I tried to convert the labels to a one-hot vector before passing it to the loss function. However, this resulted in a RuntimeError: `multi-target not supported at /opt/pytorch/pytorch/aten/src/THCUNN/generic/ClassNLLCriterion.cu:15`. So, does PyTorch not support one-hot vectors? And how does PyTorch calculate the cross entropy for two tensors `outputs = [1,0,0],[0,0,1]` and `labels = [0,2]`?"

        "content": "PyTorch does support one-hot vector representations, but it handles them differently when it comes to loss functions like `CrossEntropyLoss`. Understanding how `CrossEntropyLoss` works in PyTorch will help clarify the issue you're encountering.\n\n1. **Labels in PyTorch**: When using `CrossEntropyLoss`, PyTorch expects the labels to be class indices, not one-hot encoded vectors. This is why your labels have the shape `torch.Size([4])`, which represents the class indices directly. Each entry in this tensor is an integer representing the correct class for each sample in the batch.\n\n2. **Outputs in PyTorch**: The outputs from your neural network, with shape `torch.Size([4, 10])`, are typically raw scores (often called logits) for each class. Each row in this tensor corresponds to a sample in the batch and contains scores for each of the 10 classes.\n\n3. **How `CrossEntropyLoss` Works**: `CrossEntropyLoss` combines `LogSoftmax` and `NLLLoss` (negative log likelihood loss) in one single class. It calculates the loss by applying a softmax function to the outputs to obtain a probability distribution and then computes the negative log likelihood of the correct class based on the label indices.\n\n   For example, given:\n   - `outputs = [[1,0,0],[0,0,1]]` (assuming these are logits for two samples)\n   - `labels = [0, 2]`\n   \n   The `CrossEntropyLoss` will:\n   - Apply softmax on each row of `outputs` to get probabilities.\n   - For the first sample, it will take the probability of class 0 (the first element after softmax) and compute the negative log likelihood.\n   - For the second sample, it will take the probability of class 2 (the third element after softmax) and compute the negative log likelihood.\n   - Finally, it averages these losses over the batch.\n\n4. **Avoiding One-Hot Encoding for Labels**: Since `CrossEntropyLoss` expects class indices, converting your labels to one-hot encoded vectors will lead to errors like the one you encountered (`RuntimeError: multi-target not supported`). You should pass the class indices directly to `CrossEntropyLoss`.\n\nIn summary, PyTorch expects class indices for labels when using `CrossEntropyLoss`, not one-hot vectors. This design choice simplifies the computation of the loss and is efficient for multi-class classification tasks. If you need to work with one-hot vectors for other purposes, you can use functions like `torch.nn.functional.one_hot` to convert indices to one-hot vectors, but this is not necessary for calculating cross-entropy loss."
