On each side, there are three identical cups, with a different number of candies in each one. The cups on the red side contain 1, 3, and 5 candies. The cups on the blue side contain 2, 4, and 6 candies. The cups on the green side contain 3, 5, and 7 candies. The cups on the yellow side contain 4, 6, and 8 candies.\nYou blindfold a person and spin them around until they're dizzy. Then, you ask them to choose one of the cups from any side of the table. If they choose a cup with an odd number of candies, they win. If they choose a cup with an even number of candies, they lose.\nWhat is the probability that they will win? Use logical reasoning and mathematical equations to support your explanation. Remember, the laws of probability must still be obeyed."

        "content": "To determine the probability that the person will win by choosing a cup with an odd number of candies, we need to analyze the distribution of odd and even numbers among the cups.\n\nLet's summarize the information provided:\n\n- **Red side:** 1, 3, 5 (all odd)\n- **Blue side:** 2, 4, 6 (all even)\n- **Green side:** 3, 5, 7 (all odd)\n- **Yellow side:** 4, 6, 8 (all even)\n\nNow, count the total number of cups and the number of cups with odd numbers:\n\n1. **Total number of cups:** There are 3 cups on each of the 4 sides, so there are \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\) cups in total.\n2. **Cups with odd numbers:** \n   - Red side: 3 odd cups (1, 3, 5)\n   - Blue side: 0 odd cups\n   - Green side: 3 odd cups (3, 5, 7)\n   - Yellow side: 0 odd cups\n\nAdding these, we have \\(3 + 0 + 3 + 0 = 6\\) cups with odd numbers.\n\n3. **Probability of choosing a cup with an odd number of candies:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Probability of winning} = \\frac{\\text{Number of odd cups}}{\\text{Total number of cups}} = \\frac{6}{12} = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that the person will win by choosing a cup with an odd number of candies is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) or 50%."
