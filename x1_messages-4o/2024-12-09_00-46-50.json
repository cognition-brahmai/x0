I have a decorator as shown in the following code:\n\n```python\ndef myDecorator(test_func):\n    return callSomeWrapper(test_func)\ndef callSomeWrapper(test_func):\n    return test_func\n@myDecorator\ndef someFunc():\n    print 'hello'\n```\n\nI want to modify this decorator to accept an additional argument like this:\n\n```python\ndef myDecorator(test_func,logIt):\n    if logIt:\n        print \"Calling Function: \" + test_func.__name__\n    return callSomeWrapper(test_func)\n@myDecorator(False)\ndef someFunc():\n    print 'Hello'\n```\n\nHowever, this code results in a TypeError: `myDecorator() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)`. Why isn't the function automatically passed? How can I explicitly pass the function to the decorator function?"

        "content": "In Python, decorators are typically functions that take a function as an argument and return a new function. When you want to pass additional arguments to a decorator, you need to add an extra layer of function wrapping. This is because decorators need to be called with the function they are decorating, and if you add extra arguments directly, Python will attempt to call the decorator with only the function being decorated, leading to the error you're seeing.\n\nTo solve this, you need to create a decorator factory. The outer function will accept the additional arguments and return the actual decorator, which then takes the function as its argument. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef myDecorator(logIt):\n    # This is the actual decorator\n    def decorator(test_func):\n        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n            if logIt:\n                print(\"Calling Function: \" + test_func.__name__)\n            return test_func(*args, **kwargs)\n        return wrapper\n    return decorator\n\n@myDecorator(False)\ndef someFunc():\n    print('Hello')\n\n# Testing the function\nsomeFunc()\n```\n\nHere's the breakdown of how this works:\n\n1. `myDecorator(logIt)` is a decorator factory that takes the extra arguments you want to pass (in this case, `logIt`).\n\n2. Inside `myDecorator`, you define the actual decorator function `decorator(test_func)` that takes the function to be decorated.\n\n3. Inside the `decorator`, you define the `wrapper` function, which does the additional processing (such as logging) and calls the original function `test_func`.\n\n4. `@myDecorator(False)` first calls the `myDecorator` with `False` and returns the `decorator` function. This returned `decorator` is then used to decorate `someFunc`.\n\nWith this structure, you can pass additional arguments to your decorator as needed."
