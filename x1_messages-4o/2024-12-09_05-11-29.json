How can I remove these multiple spaces to turn it into: \"The fox jumped over the log.\", but without using methods that involve splitting and going into lists? What would be the simplest approach that can achieve this in 1-2 lines of code?"

Here's a concise approach in Python using the `re` module:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ntext = \"The   fox jumped   over    the log.\"\nresult = re.sub(r'\\s+', ' ', text)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code uses the `re.sub()` function to replace sequences of one or more whitespace characters (`\\s+`) with a single space. This approach handles multiple spaces efficiently and keeps the code to a minimum."
