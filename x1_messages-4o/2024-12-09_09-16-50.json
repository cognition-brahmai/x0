Let's assume that by \"extrapolate,\" you mean generating all integer pairs between the given pair, inclusive. Here's a basic way to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef extrapolate_pairs(pair_list):\n    result = []\n    \n    for x, y in pair_list:\n        # Ensure x is the smaller and y is the larger\n        if x > y:\n            x, y = y, x\n        # Generate pairs in increasing order\n        for i in range(x, y + 1):\n            for j in range(x, y + 1):\n                result.append((i, j))\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage\npairs = [(1, 3), (4, 2)]\nextrapolated_series = extrapolate_pairs(pairs)\nprint(extrapolated_series)\n```\n\nThis function, `extrapolate_pairs`, takes a list of pairs and generates all combinations of integer pairs between the minimum and maximum of each pair, inclusive. In the example, for the pair `(1, 3)`, it generates pairs from `(1, 1)` to `(3, 3)`, and similarly for other pairs.\n\nIf you have a different extrapolation in mind, such as generating a fixed sequence or following a specific rule, let me know, and I can adjust the code accordingly!"
