Earlier, when I used to type a function and opened a parenthesis such as in `time.sleep()`, with the cursor between the parentheses, I would get a contextual overlay menu displaying the function arguments. But now, I can't seem to see it and I am unable to find a way to enable this feature. Can someone help me with this?"

        "content": "In IPython Notebook Server 3, the feature you're referring to is the tooltip that displays the function signature and documentation when you type a function and open a parenthesis. This feature is very useful for quickly checking the arguments and available options for a function. If you are not seeing this tooltip anymore, there might be a few things you can check or try to enable it again:\n\n1. **Check if the Feature is Disabled:** Sometimes, this feature might be disabled in the settings. You can try enabling it by going to the menu bar, selecting \"Help,\" and then \"Edit Keyboard Shortcuts.\" Look for options related to tooltips or function signature help.\n\n2. **Use the Shortcut:** You can manually trigger the tooltip by placing the cursor between the parentheses of the function and pressing `Shift + Tab`. Pressing `Shift + Tab` once will give you a brief tooltip, pressing it twice will give a more detailed view, and pressing it thrice will open the documentation in a pager at the bottom of the notebook.\n\n3. **Check for Updates or Extensions:** Sometimes, updates or extensions might interfere with the default behavior. Ensure that your IPython or Jupyter Notebook extensions do not disable this feature. You might also want to check if there are any updates available for IPython or Jupyter that might fix this issue.\n\n4. **Restart and Clear Output:** Occasionally, simply restarting the notebook kernel and clearing the output can resolve such issues. You can do this by going to the \"Kernel\" menu and selecting \"Restart & Clear Output.\"\n\n5. **Browser Cache and Compatibility:** The issue might also be related to your browser. Try clearing your browser cache or using a different browser to see if the problem persists.\n\nIf none of these solutions work, consider checking the official Jupyter Notebook documentation or forums for any known issues with the version you are using. If it's a bug, it might already be reported, and a fix could be forthcoming."
