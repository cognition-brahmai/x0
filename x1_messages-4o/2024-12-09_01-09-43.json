However, I am encountering an issue where the output rows are being formatted as a list, which is not what I want. Here is the code I am currently using:\n\n```python\nconn = sqlite3.connect(dbfile)\nconn.text_factory = str ## my current (failed) attempt to resolve this\ncur = conn.cursor()\ndata = cur.execute(\"SELECT * FROM mytable\")\n\nf = open('output.csv', 'w')\nprint &gt;&gt; f, \"Column1, Column2, Column3, Etc.\"\nfor row in data:\n  print &gt;&gt; f, row\nf.close()\n```\n\nThe resulting CSV file looks like this:\n\n```\nColumn1, Column2, Column3, Etc.\n(1, u'2011-05-05 23:42:29',298776684,1448052234,463564768,-1130996322, None, u'2011-05-06 04:44:41')\n```\n\nI want to remove the parentheses, quotes, and the 'u' before strings. How do I alter my code to write the rows to the CSV file without these characters?"

        "content": "To write the rows to a CSV file without the parentheses, quotes, and the 'u' before strings, you can use the `csv` module in Python. The `csv` module provides functionality to write data in CSV format easily. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\nimport csv\n\n# Connect to the database\nconn = sqlite3.connect(dbfile)\ncur = conn.cursor()\n\n# Execute the query\ndata = cur.execute(\"SELECT * FROM mytable\")\n\n# Open the CSV file for writing\nwith open('output.csv', 'w', newline='') as f:\n    writer = csv.writer(f)\n\n    # Write the header\n    writer.writerow([\"Column1\", \"Column2\", \"Column3\", \"Etc.\"])\n\n    # Write the data rows\n    for row in data:\n        writer.writerow(row)\n\n# Close the connection\nconn.close()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **csv.writer**: This creates a writer object that will convert the data to CSV format.\n2. **writer.writerow**: This method writes a single row to the CSV file. It handles the conversion of lists or tuples into the correct CSV format.\n3. **with open**: This ensures the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised.\n\nThis approach will automatically handle special characters, quotes, and encoding issues, outputting the data in a clean CSV format."
