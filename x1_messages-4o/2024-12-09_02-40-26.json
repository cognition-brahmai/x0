Currently, I am using Keras' callback functionality to stop training when the loss doesn't improve for 2 epochs, but I want to customize this process. Here is my current code:\n\n```python\ncallbacks = [\n    EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=2, verbose=0),\n    ModelCheckpoint(kfold_weights_path, monitor='val_loss', save_best_only=True, verbose=0),\n]\nmodel.fit(X_train.astype('float32'), Y_train, batch_size=batch_size, nb_epoch=nb_epoch,\n      shuffle=True, verbose=1, validation_data=(X_valid, Y_valid),\n      callbacks=callbacks)\n```\n\nIdeally, I want to stop training based on the following condition:\n\n```python\nif val_loss < THR:\n    break\n```\n\nI have seen in the Keras documentation that it is possible to create your own callback, but I can't find how to stop the training process. Can you suggest a solution for this?"

        "content": "Certainly! To implement a custom stopping condition in Keras based on the validation loss being smaller than a defined constant `THR`, you can create a custom callback. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Subclass the `Callback` class from Keras.\n2. Override the `on_epoch_end` method to check the condition after each epoch.\n3. Use the `self.model.stop_training` flag to stop training when the condition is met.\n\nHere's a complete example of how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom keras.callbacks import Callback\n\nclass CustomEarlyStopping(Callback):\n    def __init__(self, threshold):\n        super(CustomEarlyStopping, self).__init__()\n        self.threshold = threshold\n\n    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):\n        # Get the validation loss from logs\n        val_loss = logs.get('val_loss')\n        \n        # Check if the validation loss is less than the threshold\n        if val_loss is not None and val_loss < self.threshold:\n            print(f\"\\nStopping training as val_loss < {self.threshold}\")\n            self.model.stop_training = True\n\n# Define your threshold\nTHR = 0.05  # Example threshold\n\n# Add the custom callback to your list of callbacks\ncallbacks = [\n    CustomEarlyStopping(threshold=THR),\n    ModelCheckpoint(kfold_weights_path, monitor='val_loss', save_best_only=True, verbose=0),\n]\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(X_train.astype('float32'), Y_train, batch_size=batch_size, nb_epoch=nb_epoch,\n          shuffle=True, verbose=1, validation_data=(X_valid, Y_valid),\n          callbacks=callbacks)\n```\n\nIn this code, the `CustomEarlyStopping` callback checks if the validation loss is below the specified threshold `THR` at the end of each epoch. If it is, it sets `self.model.stop_training` to `True`, which stops the training process.\n\nAdjust the `THR` value according to your specific requirement and ensure that `val_loss` is being properly monitored during training."
