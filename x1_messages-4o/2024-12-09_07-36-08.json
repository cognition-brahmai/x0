In every iteration, I want to randomly select a number that hasn't been chosen in any previous iteration and I need to iterate over all of the numbers from the range 0 to 999. What would be a smart way to do this in Python?"

        "content": "To iterate over a list of numbers from a range in random order without repetition, you can use the `random.shuffle` method from Python's `random` module. This method will randomly shuffle the elements of a list in place. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# Create a list of numbers from 0 to 999\nnumbers = list(range(1000))\n\n# Shuffle the list to randomize the order\nrandom.shuffle(numbers)\n\n# Iterate over the shuffled list\nfor i in numbers:\n    # Do something with i\n    print(i)\n```\n\nThis code will create a list of numbers from 0 to 999, shuffle them into a random order, and then iterate over them. Each number will be selected exactly once in a random sequence."
