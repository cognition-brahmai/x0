        "content": "To calculate percentiles for a sequence or a single-dimensional NumPy array in Python, you can use the `numpy.percentile()` function. This function is similar to Excel's PERCENTILE function and allows you to specify any percentile you want to compute.\n\nHere's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Example data array\ndata = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\n\n# Calculate a specific percentile, e.g., the 25th percentile\npercentile_25 = np.percentile(data, 25)\nprint(\"25th Percentile:\", percentile_25)\n\n# Calculate the median (50th percentile)\nmedian = np.percentile(data, 50)\nprint(\"Median (50th Percentile):\", median)\n\n# Calculate the 75th percentile\npercentile_75 = np.percentile(data, 75)\nprint(\"75th Percentile:\", percentile_75)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `numpy.percentile()` takes two main arguments:\n  - The first argument is the array or sequence of numbers.\n  - The second argument is the percentile you wish to compute (between 0 and 100).\n- The function returns the value below which the given percentage of observations in the data falls.\n\nThis approach is versatile and can be used to calculate any percentile you need, just like in Excel."
