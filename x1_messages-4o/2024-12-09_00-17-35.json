        "content": "CUDA 5.0, released in 2012, supports a subset of C++98, which was the prevalent standard at that time. It does not fully support C++11 features. Some of the more advanced features of C++11, such as lambda expressions, variadic templates, and certain standard library components, were not supported in CUDA 5.0. The CUDA programming model and its compiler, `nvcc`, have traditionally lagged behind the latest C++ standards due to the complexity of integrating GPU programming with advanced C++ features.\n\nFor detailed and up-to-date information, it's always best to check the official CUDA documentation provided by NVIDIA, specifically in the release notes and the programming guide of the version you are interested in. For CUDA 5.0, you might want to look at archived documentation or community discussions from around the time of its release for insights into its capabilities and limitations with regard to C++ standards.\n\nIf you need to use C++11 features with CUDA, consider upgrading to a more recent version of CUDA, as NVIDIA has progressively added support for newer C++ standards in subsequent releases."
