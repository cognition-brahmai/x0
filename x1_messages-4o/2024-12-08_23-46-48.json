Here\u2019s a suggested color combination:\n\n### Primary Colors:\n1. **Navy Blue (#1A2B4B)**\n   - Use for headers, primary buttons, and other primary elements.\n   - Provides a strong contrast against light backgrounds.\n\n2. **Soft White (#F5F5F5)**\n   - Use as the main background color. \n   - Offers excellent readability with dark text.\n\n### Secondary Colors:\n1. **Teal Green (#0F766E)**\n   - Use for secondary buttons and links.\n   - Offers a calming effect and good contrast with both the primary colors.\n\n2. **Coral (#FF6F61)**\n   - Use for highlights, call-to-actions, or alert messages.\n   - Ensures visibility and draws attention without being overwhelming.\n\n### Text Colors:\n1. **Dark Charcoal (#333333)**\n   - For main body text on light backgrounds.\n   - Provides excellent readability.\n\n2. **Soft White (#F5F5F5)**\n   - For text on dark backgrounds.\n   - Maintains readability without straining the eyes.\n\n### Accent Colors:\n1. **Sunshine Yellow (#FFD700)**\n   - Use sparingly for accents or to highlight important information.\n   - High visibility and contrast.\n\n### Accessibility Considerations:\n- **Contrast Ratio**: Ensure that the contrast ratio between text and background is at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.\n- **Color Blindness**: Avoid relying solely on color to convey information. Use patterns or textures alongside colors, especially for charts and graphs.\n- **Readability**: Opt for high contrast between text and background colors to enhance readability for all users.\n\n### Testing:\n- Use tools like WebAIM's Contrast Checker to test color combinations.\n- Consider using a color blindness simulator to ensure accessibility for color-blind users.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can create a color palette that is both visually appealing and accessible to a wide range of users."
