        "content": "Certainly! To sort an array in-place without using any built-in sort function, you can implement a basic sorting algorithm such as bubble sort, insertion sort, or selection sort. Below is an example of how you can use the bubble sort algorithm to sort the given array in C++:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n\nvoid bubbleSort(std::vector<int>& arr) {\n    int n = arr.size();\n    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; ++j) {\n            if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {\n                // Swap arr[j] and arr[j + 1]\n                int temp = arr[j];\n                arr[j] = arr[j + 1];\n                arr[j + 1] = temp;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::vector<int> arr = {5, 7, 3, 9, 10, 1};\n\n    bubbleSort(arr);\n\n    std::cout << \"Sorted array: \";\n    for (int i : arr) {\n        std::cout << i << \" \";\n    }\n    std::cout << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Bubble Sort Algorithm**:\n   - The algorithm repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.\n   - The algorithm gets its name from the way larger elements \"bubble\" to the top (or end) of the list.\n\n2. **Code Details**:\n   - The `bubbleSort` function takes a vector of integers as input and sorts it in-place.\n   - The outer loop runs `n-1` times, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.\n   - The inner loop compares each element with the next one and swaps if needed, ensuring that the largest unsorted element moves to its correct position in each pass.\n\nThis code will sort the array `[5, 7, 3, 9, 10, 1]` into `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]`."
