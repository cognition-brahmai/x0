        "content": "To find all the entries in a database with a timestamp greater than the current timestamp using SQL, you can use the `SELECT` statement combined with a `WHERE` clause that includes a comparison between the timestamp column and the current timestamp. Depending on the SQL database system you are using, the function to get the current timestamp might differ. Here are examples for some common systems:\n\n1. **MySQL**:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT *\n   FROM your_table_name\n   WHERE timestamp_column > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;\n   ```\n\n2. **PostgreSQL**:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT *\n   FROM your_table_name\n   WHERE timestamp_column > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;\n   ```\n\n3. **SQLite**:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT *\n   FROM your_table_name\n   WHERE timestamp_column > datetime('now');\n   ```\n\n4. **SQL Server**:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT *\n   FROM your_table_name\n   WHERE timestamp_column > GETDATE();\n   ```\n\n5. **Oracle**:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT *\n   FROM your_table_name\n   WHERE timestamp_column > CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;\n   ```\n\nMake sure to replace `your_table_name` with the actual name of your table and `timestamp_column` with the actual name of the column that contains the timestamps."
