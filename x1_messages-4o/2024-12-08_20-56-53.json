        "content": "To generate a list of 10 unique random integers between 1 and 100 using the `java.util.Random` class in Java, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Use a `Set` for Uniqueness**: Use a `HashSet` to store the integers because it automatically handles duplicates, ensuring all elements are unique.\n\n2. **Random Number Generation**: Use the `Random` class to generate random numbers. The `nextInt(int bound)` method of `Random` can be used to generate numbers in a specified range.\n\n3. **Loop Until the Set Contains 10 Numbers**: Continuously generate random numbers and add them to the set until it contains 10 numbers.\n\nHere is a code snippet demonstrating this approach:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.HashSet;\nimport java.util.Random;\nimport java.util.Set;\n\npublic class UniqueRandomNumbers {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Set<Integer> uniqueNumbers = new HashSet<>();\n        Random random = new Random();\n\n        while (uniqueNumbers.size() < 10) {\n            int randomNumber = random.nextInt(100) + 1; // Generates a number between 1 and 100\n            uniqueNumbers.add(randomNumber);\n        }\n\n        System.out.println(\"Unique random numbers: \" + uniqueNumbers);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **HashSet**: A `HashSet` is used to store the integers because it does not allow duplicate values. This means if a random number is generated more than once, it will only be added to the set the first time, ensuring all numbers are unique.\n\n- **Random Class**: The `Random` class is used to generate random numbers. The `nextInt(100)` method generates a random integer between 0 (inclusive) and 100 (exclusive), so adding 1 shifts the range to 1 (inclusive) to 100 (inclusive).\n\n- **While Loop**: The loop continues until the size of the set reaches 10, ensuring that you have exactly 10 unique numbers.\n\nThis approach is efficient for generating a small number of unique random numbers within a reasonably sized range, such as 1 to 100."
