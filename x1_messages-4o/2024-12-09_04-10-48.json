        "content": "To determine if a given IP address belongs to a specific network in Python, you can use the `ipaddress` module, which provides a convenient way to handle and manipulate IP addresses and networks. However, since you're asking about Python 2.5, which does not have the `ipaddress` module, you'll need to use a different approach, as Python 2.5 is quite old and lacks many modern libraries.\n\nHere's a simple way to achieve this using bitwise operations in Python 2.5:\n\n1. **Convert the IP addresses to integers.**\n2. **Perform a bitwise AND operation with the network mask.**\n3. **Check if the network address matches the IP address after masking.**\n\nHere is a sample code to do that:\n\n```python\nimport socket\nimport struct\n\ndef ip_to_int(ip):\n    return struct.unpack('!I', socket.inet_aton(ip))[0]\n\ndef is_ip_in_network(ip, network, netmask):\n    ip_int = ip_to_int(ip)\n    network_int = ip_to_int(network)\n    netmask_int = (0xFFFFFFFF << (32 - netmask)) & 0xFFFFFFFF\n    return (ip_int & netmask_int) == (network_int & netmask_int)\n\n# Example usage\nip_address = \"192.168.0.1\"\nnetwork_address = \"192.168.0.0\"\nnetmask = 24\n\nif is_ip_in_network(ip_address, network_address, netmask):\n    print(f\"{ip_address} is in the network {network_address}/{netmask}\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"{ip_address} is NOT in the network {network_address}/{netmask}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`ip_to_int(ip)`:** Converts an IP address to its integer representation using `socket.inet_aton()` and `struct.unpack()`.\n\n- **`is_ip_in_network(ip, network, netmask)`:** Checks if the given IP address belongs to the network by applying a bitwise AND operation with the network mask and comparing it to the network address.\n\nThis approach is a workaround for the lack of the `ipaddress` module in older versions of Python. If you were using a more recent version of Python, you could simply use the `ipaddress` module to achieve the same result more cleanly."
