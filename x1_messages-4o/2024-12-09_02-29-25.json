The official pandas documentation states: \"Continuous values can be discretized using the cut (bins based on values) and qcut (bins based on sample quantiles) functions\", but it's not clear to me what qcut (sample quantile) actually does or means. When should I use qcut versus cut? Here is an example of how I have used these functions:\n\n```python\nfactors = np.random.randn(30)\n\npd.cut(factors, 5)\n# Output: [(-0.411, 0.575], (-0.411, 0.575], (-0.411, 0.575], (-0.411, 0.575], (0.575, 1.561], ..., (-0.411, 0.575], (-1.397, -0.411], (0.575, 1.561], (-2.388, -1.397], (-0.411, 0.575]]\n# Length: 30\n# Categories (5, object): [(-2.388, -1.397] < (-1.397, -0.411] < (-0.411, 0.575] < (0.575, 1.561] < (1.561, 2.547]]\n\npd.qcut(factors, 5)\n# Output: [(-0.348, 0.0899], (-0.348, 0.0899], (0.0899, 1.19], (0.0899, 1.19], (0.0899, 1.19], ..., (0.0899, 1.19], (-1.137, -0.348], (1.19, 2.547], [-2.383, -1.137], (-0.348, 0.0899]]\n# Length: 30\n# Categories (5, object): [[-2.383, -1.137] < (-1.137, -0.348] < (-0.348, 0.0899] < (0.0899, 1.19] < (1.19, 2.547]]\n```"

        "content": "The key difference between `pandas.cut` and `pandas.qcut` lies in how they divide the data into bins:\n\n1. **`pandas.cut`:** This function is used to segment and sort data values into bins or intervals that you define based on the actual values of the data. When you specify `n` bins using `pandas.cut`, the function divides the range of the data into `n` equal-width bins, ensuring that the intervals (or bin edges) are of equal size along the range of the data. This is particularly useful when you want bins of equal width regardless of how many data points fall into each bin.\n\n   In your example:\n   ```python\n   pd.cut(factors, 5)\n   ```\n   This divides the range of `factors` into 5 equal-width intervals, and then assigns each value to one of these intervals.\n\n2. **`pandas.qcut`:** This function, on the other hand, is used to divide the data into bins based on sample quantiles. When you specify `n` bins using `pandas.qcut`, the function attempts to create bins such that each bin contains approximately the same number of data points. This is particularly useful when you want to ensure that each bin has an equal count of data points, which can be beneficial for evenly distributing data across bins for analysis.\n\n   In your example:\n   ```python\n   pd.qcut(factors, 5)\n   ```\n   This divides the `factors` into 5 bins, each containing approximately the same number of data points, based on the quantiles of the data.\n\n**When to use `cut` vs `qcut`:**\n\n- Use **`pandas.cut`** when you are interested in equal-width bins, particularly when the range of data is more relevant to your analysis than how the data is distributed across the range. This can be useful for creating histograms or when you need fixed intervals.\n\n- Use **`pandas.qcut`** when you want to distribute your data into bins with an equal number of samples. This is often useful in quantile-based analysis, such as dividing data into quartiles or quintiles, and for ensuring that each bin has a similar amount of data for statistical analysis or machine learning purposes.\n\nIn summary, `cut` is for equal-width intervals and `qcut` is for equal-frequency bins. Your choice depends on the context of your analysis and the nature of your data."
