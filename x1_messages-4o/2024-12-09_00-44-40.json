However, after executing `pyplot.plot(x,y)`, I am getting a large number of warning messages related to 'findfont errors'. This started happening right after I installed matplotlib and I haven't made any changes regarding fonts. I am using PyCharm, Python 3.6 and Windows for programming. The warning messages look like this:\n\n```\nDEBUG  findfont: Matching :family=sans-serif:style=normal:variant=normal:weight=normal:stretch=normal:size=10.0.\nDEBUG  findfont: score(<Font 'cmex10' (cmex10.ttf) normal normal 400 normal>) = 10.05\nDEBUG  findfont: score(<Font 'STIXSizeOneSym' (STIXSizOneSymReg.ttf) normal normal regular normal>) = 10.05\n...\nDEBUG  findfont: Matching :family=sans-serif:style=normal:variant=normal:weight=normal:stretch=normal:size=10.0 to DejaVu Sans ('C:\\\\Users\\\\chris\\\\PycharmProjects\\\\DeepNN-Solver\\\\venv\\\\lib\\\\site-packages\\\\matplotlib\\\\mpl-data\\\\fonts\\\\ttf\\\\DejaVuSans.ttf') with score of 0.050000.\n```\nHow can I solve this issue?"

        "content": "The warnings you're encountering are related to the font management system in Matplotlib. These warnings are more of a debugging output rather than errors, and they usually don't affect the plotting operation itself. However, if you'd like to suppress these warnings and ensure that fonts are properly managed, here are a few steps you can take:\n\n1. **Suppress Debug Messages**: You can configure the logging level of Matplotlib to suppress debug messages. Add the following lines at the beginning of your script to set the logging level to `WARNING`:\n\n    ```python\n    import logging\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n    logging.getLogger('matplotlib').setLevel(logging.WARNING)\n    ```\n\n2. **Clear Font Cache**: Sometimes, clearing the font cache can resolve these warnings. You can delete the font cache files manually. These files are usually located in the following directory:\n   \n   - On Windows: `C:\\Users\\<YourUsername>\\.matplotlib\\`\n   - On MacOS/Linux: `~/.cache/matplotlib/`\n\n   Look for files named `fontList.cache`, `fontList.json`, or similar and delete them. Matplotlib will regenerate these files the next time you run your script.\n\n3. **Ensure Font Availability**: Make sure that the required fonts are installed on your system. Matplotlib often defaults to `DejaVu Sans`, so ensure this font is available. You can also specify a different font family in your script:\n\n    ```python\n    plt.rcParams['font.family'] = 'Arial'  # or any other preferred font\n    ```\n\n4. **Update Matplotlib**: If you're using an outdated version of Matplotlib, consider updating it to the latest version as there might be bug fixes related to font handling:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install --upgrade matplotlib\n    ```\n\n5. **Check Virtual Environment**: If you're working in a virtual environment, ensure that all necessary packages and fonts are properly configured within that environment.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to either suppress the warnings or resolve the underlying issue causing them. Let me know if you need further assistance!"
