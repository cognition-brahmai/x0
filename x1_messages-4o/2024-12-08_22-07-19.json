        "content": "Artists, whether writers, poets, or lyricists, choose between active and passive voice based on various motivations that can be revealed through analysis of their language. Here are some potential reasons and examples:\n\n### Reasons for Choosing Active Voice:\n1. **Clarity and Directness**: Active voice is often more straightforward, making it easier for the audience to understand the message.\n2. **Engagement**: It can create a more dynamic and engaging narrative, holding the reader's or listener's attention.\n3. **Agency and Responsibility**: Emphasizes the subject performing the action, which can highlight accountability or empowerment.\n\n### Reasons for Choosing Passive Voice:\n1. **Focus on the Action**: Passive voice can shift the focus from the doer to the action or the recipient of the action.\n2. **Objectivity**: It can be useful in maintaining a neutral tone, often seen in academic or formal writing.\n3. **Mystery or Ambiguity**: Allows the artist to deliberately obscure who is performing the action, creating intrigue or suspense.\n\n### JSON Data Format:\n```json\n{\n  \"artist\": \"Example Artist\",\n  \"active_voice_use\": {\n    \"reasons\": [\n      \"Clarity and Directness\",\n      \"Engagement\",\n      \"Agency and Responsibility\"\n    ],\n    \"examples\": [\n      {\n        \"title\": \"Active Work 1\",\n        \"description\": \"A novel that uses active voice to create a vivid and engaging story.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"title\": \"Active Work 2\",\n        \"description\": \"A poem that uses active voice to empower the narrator.\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"passive_voice_use\": {\n    \"reasons\": [\n      \"Focus on the Action\",\n      \"Objectivity\",\n      \"Mystery or Ambiguity\"\n    ],\n    \"examples\": [\n      {\n        \"title\": \"Passive Work 1\",\n        \"description\": \"A short story that uses passive voice to highlight the action and create suspense.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"title\": \"Passive Work 2\",\n        \"description\": \"An essay that maintains objectivity by using passive constructions.\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Example Analysis:\nConsider an artist like Ernest Hemingway, known for his use of active voice to create clear and engaging narratives. In contrast, someone like Virginia Woolf might employ passive voice to focus on internal thoughts and the subtleties of action happening within the character's minds.\n\nIn analyzing an artist's work, look for patterns in their language that reveal their motivations. For example, frequent use of passive constructions may indicate a desire to focus on themes of inevitability or fate, while active constructions might suggest a theme of personal agency and decision-making."
