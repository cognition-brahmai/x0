Your strategy must focus on promoting the medical practice's services and increasing website traffic. To achieve this, you have a budget of $10,000 and only four weeks to execute your plan.\nYou decide to start by creating a social media campaign that includes three different platforms. The first platform is Instagram, where you plan to post pictures of healthy lifestyles and fitness, while incorporating the medical practice's services in the captions. The second platform is TikTok, where you plan to create short videos that showcase the medical practice's services in a fun and engaging way. The third platform is Twitter, where you plan to engage in conversations about health and wellness with popular influencers.\nTo maximize the effectiveness of your social media campaign, you also plan to run a targeted advertising campaign on Facebook and Google. The Facebook campaign will target users who have shown interest in health and fitness, while the Google campaign will target users who have searched for medical services in your area.\nLastly, to boost website traffic and patient acquisition rates, you plan to offer a limited-time discount on the medical practice's services for new patients who schedule an appointment through the website.\nYour success will be measured by the number of new patients acquired, website traffic, and engagement on social media platforms. Can you create a plan that effectively engages with millennials and Gen Z, promotes the medical practice's services, and stays within the given budget and timeframe?"
