Use `if t is not None:`\". How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that TensorFlow uses `tf.Tensor` objects, which are not compatible with standard Python control flow statements like `if` statements. When working with TensorFlow, you need to use TensorFlow operations to ensure compatibility with the computation graph.\n\nTo implement your custom activation function, you should use TensorFlow operations like `tf.where` or `tf.nn.relu`. Here's one way to modify your function using `tf.where`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ndef myfunc(x):\n    return tf.where(x > 0, tf.ones_like(x), tf.zeros_like(x))\n\n# Example usage\nx = tf.constant([-1.0, 2.0, 0.0, 3.5])\noutput = myfunc(x)\nprint(output.numpy())  # This will print: [0. 1. 0. 1.]\n```\n\nThis implementation uses `tf.where`, which takes a condition, a value to return where the condition is true, and a value to return where the condition is false. `tf.ones_like(x)` and `tf.zeros_like(x)` create tensors of ones and zeros, respectively, with the same shape as `x`.\n\nThis approach ensures that the function can be used as part of a TensorFlow computation graph and is compatible with TensorFlow's execution model."
