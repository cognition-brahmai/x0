But here's the catch, you must include the article's title, publication date, and author's name in the XML file, while also arranging the category tags alphabetically. To make it more challenging, the categories must be assigned based on the number of vowels in each word, with the highest number of vowels assigned to the category with the most letters. Can you solve this logic puzzle?"
