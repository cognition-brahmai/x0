How can I append an array to an existing array where each element is an array itself?"

        "content": "Your implementation of appending arrays to an existing list is actually correct. The issue might not be in the code you provided but rather in how you're interpreting the results or any additional code not shown here. In your code, `C` is being used as a list that holds other lists, which is essentially a 2D list. \n\nHere's a breakdown of your code and what it does:\n\n1. You initialize `C` as an empty list.\n2. You append `C0`, which is a list, to `C`.\n3. You create another list called `temp`.\n4. You append `temp` to `C`.\n5. Finally, you print `C`.\n\nThis should result in `C` containing two lists: `C0` and `temp`. The output of `print(C)` should look like this:\n\n```python\n[\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n]\n```\n\nIf you're not seeing this output, consider checking:\n\n- If there are any additional modifications to `C` elsewhere in your code.\n- Ensure that the code block you provided is executed correctly.\n- Verify that there are no syntax errors or runtime errors in other parts of your code affecting this portion.\n\nIf your goal is to work with these lists further, remember that you can access individual sublists using their index, e.g., `C[0]` for `C0` and `C[1]` for `temp`."
