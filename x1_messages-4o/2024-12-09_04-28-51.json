        "content": "To break up a document into individual sentences using SpaCy, you can use its sentence segmentation capabilities. SpaCy provides a convenient way to work with linguistic annotations and allows you to process and split text into sentences. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n1. **Install SpaCy**: If you haven't already, you need to install SpaCy and download a language model. You can do this using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install spacy\n   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm\n   ```\n\n2. **Use SpaCy to Split Sentences**: You can then use SpaCy to process your text and split it into sentences. Here is a sample script:\n\n   ```python\n   import spacy\n\n   # Load the English language model\n   nlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n   # The text you want to split\n   text = \"The dog ran. The cat jumped.\"\n\n   # Process the text with SpaCy\n   doc = nlp(text)\n\n   # Extract sentences\n   sentences = [sent.text for sent in doc.sents]\n\n   # Print the list of sentences\n   print(sentences)\n   ```\n\n   This script will output:\n\n   ```\n   ['The dog ran.', 'The cat jumped.']\n   ```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- **Load Model**: `nlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")` loads the English language model, which includes the tokenizer and other components needed for processing text.\n- **Process Text**: `doc = nlp(text)` processes the text and returns a `Doc` object, which contains the processed linguistic annotations.\n- **Extract Sentences**: `doc.sents` is a generator that yields `Span` objects, each representing a sentence. By iterating over `doc.sents` and extracting the text with `sent.text`, you get a list of sentences.\n\nThis approach uses SpaCy's default sentence segmentation, which is usually sufficient for standard text. If you have more complex sentence structures or need custom segmentation, SpaCy also allows for customization of its pipeline components."
