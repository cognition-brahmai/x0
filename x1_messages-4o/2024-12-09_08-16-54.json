        "content": "Yes, it is possible to use the cuSOLVER library from CUDA to solve dense linear systems of the form \\( AX = B \\), where \\( A \\), \\( X \\), and \\( B \\) are \\( N \\times N \\) dense matrices. The cuSOLVER library provides GPU-accelerated linear algebra routines, and one of its components is the Dense Linear Algebra (cuSOLVERDN) module, which includes functions for solving systems of linear equations.\n\nTo solve the system \\( AX = B \\), you can use the LU decomposition functionality available in cuSOLVERDN. The typical sequence of operations would involve:\n\n1. **LU Factorization**: Use the `cusolverDnDgetrf` function to compute the LU factorization of matrix \\( A \\). This function factors the matrix as \\( A = PLU \\), where \\( P \\) is a permutation matrix, and \\( L \\) and \\( U \\) are the lower and upper triangular matrices, respectively.\n\n2. **Solve the System**: Use the `cusolverDnDgetrs` function to solve the equation \\( AX = B \\) using the LU factorization obtained in the previous step. This function uses the \\( L \\) and \\( U \\) matrices to solve for \\( X \\) given \\( B \\).\n\nHere is a basic outline of the steps involved:\n\n1. Allocate memory on the GPU for matrices \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and \\( X \\).\n2. Copy the matrices \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) from the host to the device.\n3. Perform LU factorization using `cusolverDnDgetrf`.\n4. Solve for \\( X \\) using `cusolverDnDgetrs`.\n5. Copy the solution matrix \\( X \\) from the device back to the host.\n\nMake sure you have proper error handling, and you manage GPU resources efficiently by allocating and freeing memory as needed. Additionally, ensure you have the correct setup for cuSOLVER and CUDA, including linking the appropriate libraries when compiling your code."
