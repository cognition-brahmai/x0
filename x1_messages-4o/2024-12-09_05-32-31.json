Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Your initial list of lists\nlist_of_lists = [[1,4,7],[3,6,9],[2,59,8]]\n\n# Sort the list of lists based on the first element of each sublist\nsorted_list_of_lists = sorted(list_of_lists, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n# Print the sorted list\nprint(sorted_list_of_lists)\n```\n\nIn this code, the `sorted()` function is used to sort `list_of_lists`. The `key` parameter is a function that extracts the sorting key from each element. Here, `lambda x: x[0]` is used to specify that the sorting key should be the first element of each sublist (`x[0]`). This will give you the desired output:\n\n```\n[[1, 4, 7], [2, 59, 8], [3, 6, 9]]\n```"
