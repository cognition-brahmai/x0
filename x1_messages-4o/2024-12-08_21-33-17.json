        "content": "To ensure that the generated sentence always starts with a capital letter, you can modify the SQL query to capitalize the first letter of the selected reason. This can be achieved using SQL functions to manipulate the string.\n\nHere's how you can modify your SQL query:\n\n```csharp\nstring query = \"SELECT CONCAT(UCASE(LEFT(reason, 1)), SUBSTRING(reason, 2)) AS capitalized_reason FROM bizarre_reasons WHERE profanity = 0 ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 1\";\n\n// Assume you have a method to execute the query and get the result\nstring[] reasons = ExecuteQuery(query);\n\nRandom rand = new Random();\nint index = rand.Next(reasons.Length);\nstring sentence = \"Alice was late because \" + reasons[index];\n\nConsole.WriteLine(sentence);\n```\n\nIn this modified query:\n- `UCASE(LEFT(reason, 1))` converts the first letter of the `reason` to uppercase.\n- `SUBSTRING(reason, 2)` extracts the rest of the string starting from the second character.\n- `CONCAT(...)` combines these parts to produce a reason with the first letter capitalized.\n\nBy using this approach, you ensure that the generated sentence always begins with a capital letter without altering the original data in the database."
