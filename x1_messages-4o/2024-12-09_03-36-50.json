I'm not looking for a way to escape the quotes with slashes, but rather a general-purpose method that makes everything in a string literal so that I don't have to manually escape everything for very large strings."

        "content": "In Python, you can achieve the behavior of treating a string such that everything within it is automatically escaped or treated as a literal by using raw strings. A raw string in Python is prefixed with an `r` or `R` and treats backslashes (`\\`) as literal characters. This is particularly useful for regular expressions, file paths, and any situation where you want to include backslashes in your string without having them interpreted as escape characters.\n\nHere's an example of how to use raw strings:\n\n```python\n# Normal string\nnormal_string = \"This is a newline character: \\n\"\n\n# Raw string\nraw_string = r\"This is a newline character: \\n\"\n\nprint(\"Normal String:\")\nprint(normal_string)  # This will interpret \\n as a newline\n\nprint(\"\\nRaw String:\")\nprint(raw_string)     # This will display \\n as two characters: \\ and n\n```\n\nIn this example, the raw string does not interpret `\\n` as a newline but rather as the literal characters `\\` and `n`. This way, you don't have to manually escape backslashes or other special characters in your string.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that raw strings cannot end with an odd number of backslashes because the last backslash would escape the quote character itself. If you need to include a backslash at the end of a raw string, you can concatenate it with an empty string or use a different approach.\n\n```python\n# Raw string ending with a backslash\nraw_string_with_backslash = r\"This is a backslash at the end: \\\\\"[:-1]\nprint(raw_string_with_backslash)\n```\n\nIn this example, we slice off the last character after adding an extra backslash to achieve the desired result."
