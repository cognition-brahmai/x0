I initially thought it was used to limit accessible members of a module, implying that only the elements listed in `__all__` would appear when `dir(module)` is executed. However, upon testing, it seems not to function as I expected. Can someone explain its purpose and functionality?"

        "content": "The `__all__` variable in Python is used to define a list of public objects of a module. It is a convention that helps control what is exported when `from module import *` is used. This is particularly useful for modules that have a large number of internal helper functions or classes that you don't want to expose to users.\n\nHere's how `__all__` works:\n\n1. **Purpose**: The main purpose of `__all__` is to specify which module attributes should be exposed as public API when `from module import *` is used. It essentially defines a \"whitelist\" of attributes that should be imported.\n\n2. **Functionality**:\n   - When `from module import *` is executed, Python will import only those names listed in the `__all__` list. If `__all__` is not defined, then all names that do not start with an underscore (`_`) will be imported.\n   - `__all__` does not restrict access to module attributes directly. Even if a name is not included in `__all__`, it can still be accessed directly with `module.name`.\n   \n3. **Impact on `dir()`**: The `dir()` function is not affected by `__all__`. It lists all attributes of a module, including those that are not meant to be public. Therefore, using `__all__` will not alter the output of `dir(module)`.\n\n4. **Use Case**: `__all__` is particularly useful for maintaining clean namespaces and for defining a clear API for users of the module. It allows module authors to prevent certain functions or classes from being unintentionally exposed to users.\n\nHere's an example of how `__all__` is used:\n\n```python\n# mymodule.py\n__all__ = ['public_function', 'PublicClass']\n\ndef public_function():\n    pass\n\ndef _private_function():\n    pass\n\nclass PublicClass:\n    pass\n\nclass _PrivateClass:\n    pass\n```\n\nIn this example, if you do `from mymodule import *`, only `public_function` and `PublicClass` will be imported into the namespace, while `_private_function` and `_PrivateClass` will not. However, they can still be accessed directly using `mymodule._private_function()` or `mymodule._PrivateClass()`."
