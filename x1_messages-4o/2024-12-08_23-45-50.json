For example, if the user selects an option that suggests Tom is unpopular, then the following options should reflect that assumption and only include other negative adjectives. Can you also suggest any other creative methods for generating the question and answer options based on Tom's social standing?"

        "content": "To create a dynamic options list that adjusts based on user input, you can implement a system that tracks the context of previous answers and modifies subsequent questions accordingly. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Context Tracking**: Maintain a context state that updates with each user selection. This state will store information about Tom's perceived social standing based on previous choices.\n\n2. **Option Filtering**: Develop a function that filters the options for each subsequent question based on the current context. For example, if the context indicates that Tom is unpopular, the function will select adjectives or scenarios that align with this perception.\n\n3. **Adaptive Question Generation**: Use conditional logic to tailor questions based on the context. This could involve pre-written templates that fill in variables according to Tom's perceived status.\n\n4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Implement sentiment analysis on user responses to adjust the context more subtly. For example, if a user selects \"Tom is shy,\" you might infer a neutral or slightly negative social standing and adjust options accordingly.\n\n5. **Weighted Options**: Assign weight to each option reflecting its impact on Tom's social standing. Adjust these weights dynamically based on user selections, influencing the available options in future questions.\n\n6. **Creative Methods for Generating Questions/Options**:\n   - **Role-Playing Scenarios**: Craft questions that place Tom in various social situations, asking users to choose how he might react. Adjust scenarios based on previous responses.\n   - **Story Progression**: Create a narrative where each question represents a chapter. The user's choices affect the storyline, dynamically changing Tom's social standing and the nature of future questions.\n   - **Character Feedback**: Introduce other fictional characters who provide feedback or opinions on Tom. Their comments can influence the option set and provide further context clues.\n   - **Interactive Polling**: Use polling to gauge user perception at key points. Adjust future questions based on the majority opinion, creating a collective influence on Tom's social narrative.\n\nBy employing these strategies, you can create a dynamic and engaging experience that adapts to user inputs, maintaining a coherent and interesting exploration of Tom's social standing."
