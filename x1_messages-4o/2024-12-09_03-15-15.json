I've previously been using `flavor='mysql'`, but since it will be depreciated in the future, I want to transition to using SQLAlchemy engine. My code is executing the read operation correctly, but the `to_sql` operation is throwing a `DatabaseError: Execution failed on sql 'SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name=?;': Wrong number of arguments during string formatting`. Why does it look like it is trying to use SQLite? How do I correctly use a SQLAlchemy connection with MySQL and specifically mysql.connector? I also tried passing the engine as the connection, but that gave me an `AttributeError: 'Engine' object has no attribute 'cursor'`. How can I solve this?\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport mysql.connector\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\n\nengine = create_engine('mysql+mysqlconnector://[user]:[pass]@[host]:[port]/[schema]', echo=False)\ncnx = engine.raw_connection()\ndata = pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM sample_table', cnx)\ndata.to_sql(name='sample_table2', con=cnx, if_exists = 'append', index=False)\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering seems to stem from the incorrect use of the connection object with the `to_sql` method. When using SQLAlchemy, you should pass the `engine` object directly to the `con` parameter in `to_sql`, rather than the raw connection object. The `to_sql` method is designed to work with SQLAlchemy engines directly, not with connections or cursors.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to correctly use SQLAlchemy with MySQL:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\n\n# Create an SQLAlchemy engine\nengine = create_engine('mysql+mysqlconnector://[user]:[pass]@[host]:[port]/[schema]', echo=False)\n\n# Use the engine directly to read from the database\ndata = pd.read_sql('SELECT * FROM sample_table', engine)\n\n# Use the engine directly to write to the database\ndata.to_sql(name='sample_table2', con=engine, if_exists='append', index=False)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **SQLAlchemy Engine**: The `create_engine` function from SQLAlchemy is used to create an engine that serves as a source of database connections. This engine should be passed directly to `pd.read_sql` and `pd.to_sql`.\n\n2. **Connection vs. Engine**: In your original code, `cnx = engine.raw_connection()` retrieves a low-level connection object, which is not necessary when using pandas with SQLAlchemy. Instead, pass the `engine` directly to `to_sql`.\n\n3. **MySQL Connector**: Make sure you have the `mysql-connector-python` package installed, as it is required for `mysql+mysqlconnector` in the connection string.\n\nBy making these changes, you should be able to read from and write to your MySQL database without encountering the SQLite-related error."
