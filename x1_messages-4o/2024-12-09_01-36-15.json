        "content": "To get the line count of a large file in Python efficiently, you can read the file in chunks rather than loading the entire file into memory. This can be done using Python's built-in `open()` function along with iterating over the file object. Here's a memory- and time-efficient way to count lines in a large file:\n\n```python\ndef count_lines(filename):\n    with open(filename, 'r') as file:\n        line_count = sum(1 for _ in file)\n    return line_count\n\n# Usage\nfilename = 'your_large_file.txt'\nline_count = count_lines(filename)\nprint(f\"The file has {line_count} lines.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Opening the File**: The `open()` function is used to open the file in read mode (`'r'`).\n\n2. **Iterating Over the File**: By iterating over the file object directly (`for _ in file`), Python reads the file line by line, which is both memory-efficient and relatively fast.\n\n3. **Counting Lines**: The `sum(1 for _ in file)` construct counts each line by summing up 1 for each iteration over the file.\n\nThis method ensures that only one line is held in memory at a time, making it suitable for very large files."
