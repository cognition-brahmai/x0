        "content": "The error you're encountering, `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Apps aren't loaded yet`, typically means that there is an issue with how Django is aware of your apps. Here are some steps to properly create new apps within the `/server` directory of your Django project and resolve the error:\n\n1. **Create the App Correctly:**\n\n   Make sure you're in the `/server` directory when you run the `startapp` command. The correct command is:\n\n   ```bash\n   python ../manage.py startapp app_name\n   ```\n\n   Ensure the `manage.py` script is executed from the root of the project, which is one directory above `/server`.\n\n2. **Add the App to Installed Apps:**\n\n   After creating the new app, you need to add it to the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting in your main settings file (likely located at `/server/proj/settings.py`). You should add `'app_name'` to the list. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   INSTALLED_APPS = [\n       # ... other installed apps\n       'app1',\n       'app2',\n       'app_name',  # add your new app here\n   ]\n   ```\n\n3. **Check the Apps Directory:**\n\n   Ensure that the created app's directory structure is correct and contains the necessary files, such as `apps.py`, `models.py`, `views.py`, etc.\n\n4. **Check PYTHONPATH:**\n\n   Ensure your `PYTHONPATH` includes the `/server` directory or the root of your project. This is important for Python to locate your apps correctly.\n\n5. **Server Restart:**\n\n   Always restart your server after making changes to the settings or adding a new app:\n\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py runserver\n   ```\n\n6. **Manage Imports:**\n\n   Check your imports and make sure there are no circular dependencies that might be causing Django to fail to load apps.\n\nIf you follow these steps and ensure that everything is set up correctly, the error should be resolved, allowing you to create and run new apps within your Django project without encountering the `AppRegistryNotReady` error."
