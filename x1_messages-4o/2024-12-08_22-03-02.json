Additionally, provide the hex code for each color value. The fruits are: \n- Red Delicious Apple \n- Green Granny Smith Apple \n- Purple Concord Grape \n- Green Seedless Grape \n- Red Watermelon \n- Green Watermelon \nNote: The RGB color model uses a combination of red, green, and blue light to create a wide range of colors. The hex code is a 6-digit code representing the intensity of each color."
