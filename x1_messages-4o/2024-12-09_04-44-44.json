However, my primary goal is to download and extract the zip file and pass the contents (CSV data) via a TCP stream, without writing any of the zip or extracted files to disk. Could you guide me on how to achieve this?"

        "content": "Certainly! To achieve your goal of downloading, extracting, and streaming the contents of ZIP files without writing them to disk, you can use Python's `requests` library to download the ZIP file, `zipfile` to handle the extraction in memory, and the `socket` library for TCP streaming.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide and example code to help you accomplish this:\n\n1. **Download the ZIP file using `requests`.**\n2. **Extract the ZIP file in memory using `zipfile`.**\n3. **Stream the contents over a TCP connection using `socket`.**\n\nHere's an example script to demonstrate these steps:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport zipfile\nimport io\nimport socket\n\ndef download_and_stream_zip(url, host, port):\n    # Step 1: Download the ZIP file in memory\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    response.raise_for_status()  # Ensure the request was successful\n    \n    # Step 2: Open the ZIP file in memory\n    with zipfile.ZipFile(io.BytesIO(response.content)) as z:\n        # Iterate over each file in the ZIP archive\n        for filename in z.namelist():\n            # Open each file in the ZIP archive\n            with z.open(filename) as file:\n                # Read the file content\n                file_content = file.read()\n                \n                # Step 3: Stream the content via a TCP connection\n                with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:\n                    s.connect((host, port))\n                    s.sendall(file_content)\n                    print(f\"Sent {len(file_content)} bytes of {filename} to {host}:{port}\")\n\n# Example usage\nurl = 'http://example.com/path/to/your/file.zip'\nhost = 'localhost'\nport = 12345\ndownload_and_stream_zip(url, host, port)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **`requests.get(url)`:** This function downloads the ZIP file as a response object without saving it to disk.\n- **`zipfile.ZipFile(io.BytesIO(response.content))`:** This allows you to read the ZIP file directly from memory.\n- **`z.open(filename)`:** Used to open each file in the ZIP archive.\n- **`socket` library:** Used to create a TCP connection to the specified host and port, and send the file content over the stream.\n\n### Notes:\n- Ensure the receiving end (server) is set up to accept and handle the TCP stream data.\n- Adjust the `host` and `port` variables to match your server configuration.\n- You might need to handle exceptions and edge cases, such as network failures or incorrect file formats, based on your application requirements.\n\nThis approach allows you to efficiently handle ZIP files in memory and transmit the data over a network without writing to disk, which can be useful for applications with performance or security constraints."
