        "content": "Yes, there is a straightforward method to swap the x-axis with the y-axis after plotting a graph using `matplotlib`. You can achieve this by using the `transpose` method on your data or by switching the axis labels. Here's a simple way to do it using the `transpose` method:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Sample data\nx = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\ny = np.array([10, 20, 25, 30, 40])\n\n# Plot original data\nplt.figure()\nplt.plot(x, y, label='Original')\nplt.xlabel('X-axis')\nplt.ylabel('Y-axis')\nplt.legend()\n\n# Swap axes\nplt.figure()\nplt.plot(y, x, label='Swapped')\nplt.xlabel('Y-axis')  # Now x data becomes y-axis\nplt.ylabel('X-axis')  # Now y data becomes x-axis\nplt.legend()\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this example, the original plot is created with `x` as the x-axis and `y` as the y-axis. To swap the axes, you simply plot `y` against `x`. Remember to also swap the axis labels to accurately reflect the new data orientation.\n\nAlternatively, if you want to keep the same data but just change the orientation of the plot, you can use `plt.gca().invert_xaxis()` and `plt.gca().invert_yaxis()` to flip the axes, although this only changes the direction rather than swapping them."
