        "content": "Certainly! The existing implementation can be optimized by removing some redundant checks and using more efficient operations. Here's an optimized version:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef entropy(labels):\n    \"\"\" Computes entropy of 0-1 vector more efficiently. \"\"\"\n    n_labels = len(labels)\n    \n    # If there are no labels or only one unique label, entropy is zero.\n    if n_labels <= 1:\n        return 0.0\n\n    # Calculate the proportion of each class\n    counts = np.bincount(labels, minlength=2)  # Ensure that we always have two bins\n    probs = counts / n_labels\n\n    # Filter out zero probabilities\n    probs = probs[probs > 0]\n\n    # Compute the entropy\n    return -np.sum(probs * np.log2(probs))\n\n# Example usage\nlabels = np.array([0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1])\nprint(entropy(labels))\n```\n\n### Key Improvements:\n1. **Use `minlength` in `np.bincount`:** This ensures that the bin count always considers both possible outcomes (0 and 1), even if one of them doesn't exist in the input vector.\n\n2. **Remove unnecessary checks:**\n   - The check for `n_classes <= 1` is removed since we handle this by ensuring at least two bins are counted.\n\n3. **Use `np.log2`:** Using base 2 for the logarithm is more conventional when calculating entropy, aligning with information theory standards.\n\n4. **Vectorized operations:** The use of `np.bincount` and array operations ensures efficient computation.\n\nThis should provide a faster computation, especially when processing large datasets or calling the function multiple times."
