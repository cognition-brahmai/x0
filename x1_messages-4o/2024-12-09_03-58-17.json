Specifically, I have a series `s = pd.Series(['cat','hat','dog','fog','pet'])` and I want to find all places where the string `s` contains any of the substrings `['og', 'at']`. The desired output should exclude 'pet'. I attempted to solve this by using a combination of `df.isin()` and `df[col].str.contains()`. I also tried the following code:\n\n```python\nsearchfor = ['og', 'at']\nfound = [s.str.contains(x) for x in searchfor]\nresult = pd.DataFrame[found]\nresult.any()\n```\nHowever, it seems inelegant. Is there a better way to achieve this?"

        "content": "Certainly! You can approach this problem using the `str.contains()` method with a regex pattern that combines all the substrings you want to search for. This way, you can avoid looping and make your solution more elegant and efficient. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ns = pd.Series(['cat', 'hat', 'dog', 'fog', 'pet'])\nsearchfor = ['og', 'at']\n\n# Create a regex pattern that matches any of the substrings\npattern = '|'.join(searchfor)\n\n# Use str.contains with the regex pattern\nresult = s[s.str.contains(pattern)]\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `pattern = '|'.join(searchfor)`: Creates a regex pattern that matches any of the substrings in the `searchfor` list. The `|` operator is used in regex to denote \"or\".\n- `s.str.contains(pattern)`: Checks each string in the Series `s` to see if it contains any of the substrings specified in the regex pattern.\n- `s[...]`: Filters the Series to include only those elements that contain any of the substrings.\n\nThis approach is more concise and leverages the power of regular expressions for efficient pattern matching."
