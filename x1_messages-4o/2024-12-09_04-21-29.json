        "content": "To transition your `entry_points` configuration from `setup.py` to `setup.cfg`, you've got the right idea in your `setup.cfg` snippet. However, let's ensure everything is set up correctly. Here is a more complete version of what your `setup.cfg` might look like:\n\n```ini\n[metadata]\nname = my-package\nversion = 0.1.0  # Make sure to define the version here or fetch it dynamically if needed\ndescription = my-package\nlong_description = file: README.md\nlong_description_content_type = text/markdown  # Assuming your README is in Markdown\nlicense = unlicensed\nplatforms = any\nclassifiers =\n    Programming Language :: Python :: 3\n    Programming Language :: Python :: 3.8  # Specify your supported Python versions\n    Operating System :: OS Independent\n\n[options]\npackages = find:\nzip_safe = False\ninclude_package_data = True\ninstall_requires =\n    # Add your package dependencies here, e.g.,\n    # requests>=2.23.0\n    # numpy>=1.19.0\ntests_require =\n    pytest\n    pytest-cov\n\n[options.packages.find]\nwhere = .\n\n[entry_points]\nconsole_scripts =\n    my-package = my_package.app.run:cli\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **Version**: Make sure you specify the version in the `metadata` section. If you have a dynamic way to get the version, you might need to modify your build process to inject it.\n\n2. **long_description**: This should point to your README file, and you should specify the format of your README, such as `text/markdown` if it's a Markdown file.\n\n3. **install_requires**: Make sure you list your package dependencies here if any.\n\n4. **[options.packages.find]**: This section is used to automatically find all packages and sub-packages. The `where = .` indicates that the search should start from the directory where `setup.cfg` is located.\n\n5. **Entry Points**: Your `entry_points` configuration is correct for specifying a console script. Once installed, the user can run `my-package` from the command line, and it will execute `cli()` from `my_package.app.run`.\n\n6. **Testing**: Ensure your `tests_require` section lists any testing dependencies you need.\n\nAfter setting up your `setup.cfg`, you can use tools like `setuptools` and `wheel` to build and distribute your package:\n\n```sh\npython -m pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel\npython setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\n```\n\nThen, you can test your installation with:\n\n```sh\npip install .\n```\n\nAnd finally, run your script with:\n\n```sh\nmy-package\n```\n\nThis should correctly execute your specified entry point."
