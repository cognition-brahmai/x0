I have already created an add form with a complex function for handling it and I want to use the same template for the edit form, but just add an 'id' field to it. However, I am facing problems with setting 'article.id' in the add function and preserving the dynamically added field in the edit function if the form is invalid. Here is my existing 'add' function:\n\n```python\ndef add(req):\n    if req.method == 'POST':\n        form = ArticleForm(req.POST)\n        if form.is_valid():\n            article = form.save(commit=False)\n            article.author = req.user\n            # more processing ...\n```"

        "content": "To create an edit form in Django that leverages your existing add form functionality without duplicating code, you can refactor your view to handle both adding new instances and editing existing ones. Here\u2019s a structured approach to achieve this:\n\n1. **Refactor the View**: Combine the add and edit functionality into a single view that can handle both operations based on whether an instance ID is provided.\n\n2. **Use the Same Template**: You can use the same template for both adding and editing, with minor modifications to handle the `id` field and dynamic changes.\n\nHere's how you can refactor your code:\n\n```python\nfrom django.shortcuts import render, get_object_or_404, redirect\nfrom .models import Article\nfrom .forms import ArticleForm\n\ndef article_form(req, id=None):\n    # Determine if this is an edit or add operation\n    if id:\n        article = get_object_or_404(Article, id=id)\n    else:\n        article = None\n\n    if req.method == 'POST':\n        form = ArticleForm(req.POST, instance=article)\n        if form.is_valid():\n            article = form.save(commit=False)\n            article.author = req.user\n            # More processing if needed\n            article.save()\n            return redirect('article_detail', id=article.id)\n    else:\n        form = ArticleForm(instance=article)\n\n    return render(req, 'article_form.html', {'form': form, 'article': article})\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Unified View Function**: The `article_form` function handles both adding and editing. It checks if an `id` is provided to determine if it's an edit operation.\n  \n- **Instance Handling**: If it's an edit, it fetches the existing `Article` instance. If not, it initializes the form without an instance to add a new article.\n\n- **Form Initialization**: Use `ArticleForm(req.POST, instance=article)` to bind POST data to the form, whether adding or editing. If it's a GET request, initialize the form with the existing instance, if any.\n\n- **Saving Changes**: When the form is valid, it saves changes to the existing article if editing, or creates a new one if adding.\n\n- **Template Reuse**: In your template (`article_form.html`), you can use the same fields for both operations. You might want to add logic to display or hide certain elements based on whether `article` is `None`.\n\n### Template Example:\n```html\n<form method=\"post\">\n    {% csrf_token %}\n    {{ form.as_p }}\n    <button type=\"submit\">Save</button>\n</form>\n```\n\n### Preserving Dynamic Fields:\nIf you have dynamically added fields (e.g., through JavaScript), ensure that these fields are included in the POST data and handled appropriately in your form validation and processing logic.\n\nBy using this approach, you eliminate code duplication and maintain a cleaner, more maintainable codebase."
