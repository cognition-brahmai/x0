However, when I simply run the 'python' command, it only provides me with the version information and not the bit-specific details. Furthermore, I noticed that the Python download site offers two different versions for Mac i.e., 32-bit and 64-bit, but only one version for Linux. Which command should I use to check if my Python is 32-bit or 64-bit?"

        "content": "To determine whether your Python installation is compiled for a 32-bit or 64-bit system, you can use the `platform` module in Python. Here's a simple way to check:\n\n1. Open your terminal or command prompt.\n2. Start the Python interpreter by typing `python` or `python3`, depending on your system setup.\n3. Once you are in the Python shell, execute the following command:\n\n```python\nimport platform\nprint(platform.architecture())\n```\n\nThis will return a tuple with the bit architecture and the format, typically something like `('64bit', 'ELF')` for a 64-bit system or `('32bit', 'ELF')` for a 32-bit system.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the `sys` module:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nprint(sys.maxsize > 2**32)\n```\n\nThis will return `True` if your Python is 64-bit and `False` if it's 32-bit.\n\nRegarding the Python download site, it's common for Linux to offer only one version because most Linux distributions can seamlessly handle 64-bit applications, and the system often defaults to 64-bit if possible. However, Mac may offer both to support older hardware or specific use cases where a 32-bit version is preferred."
