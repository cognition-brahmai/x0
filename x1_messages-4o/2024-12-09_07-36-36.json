        "content": "I'm trying to create a utility class in Python that contains only static methods which can be called by using the class name as a prefix. However, I'm encountering some issues. Here is the class I've written:\n\n```python\nclass FileUtility():\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def GetFileSize(self, fullName):\n        fileSize = os.path.getsize(fullName)\n        return fileSize\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def GetFilePath(self, fullName):\n        filePath = os.path.abspath(fullName)\n        return filePath\n```\n\nI'm trying to call these methods from my main function:\n\n```python\nfrom FileUtility import *\ndef main():\n        path = 'C:\\config_file_list.txt'\n        dir = FileUtility.GetFilePath(path)\n        print dir\n```\n\nThis gives me an error: `unbound method GetFilePath() must be called with FileUtility instance as first argument (got str instance instead)`. My questions are:\n\n1. What am I doing wrong? Shouldn't a static method be callable by the class name?\n2. Do I need a utility class, or are there other ways to achieve the same in Python?\n3. When I try to change the code in main to this:\n\n```python\nfrom FileUtility import *\ndef main():\n    objFile = FileUtility()\n    path = 'H:\\config_file_list.txt'\n    dir = objFile.GetFilePath(path)\n    print dir\n```\n\nI get a new error: `TypeError: GetFilePath() takes exactly 1 argument (2 given)`. What am I doing wrong?"

        "content": "Let's address the issues and questions you have one by one:\n\n### 1. Static Method Definition and Usage\n\nYou're right that static methods should be callable by using the class name. However, there are a few issues in your current implementation:\n\n- **Incorrect Parameter in Static Method**: Static methods should not have a `self` parameter. The `self` parameter is used in instance methods to refer to the instance of the class, but static methods do not need it since they are not bound to an instance.\n\nHere's how you should define your static methods:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nclass FileUtility:\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def GetFileSize(fullName):\n        fileSize = os.path.getsize(fullName)\n        return fileSize\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def GetFilePath(fullName):\n        filePath = os.path.abspath(fullName)\n        return filePath\n```\n\n### 2. Import Statement and File Structure\n\n- **Importing the Class**: You need to ensure that `FileUtility` is defined in a separate module (file) named `FileUtility.py`. When you import it, make sure that the import statement is correct. If `FileUtility` is in a different directory, you might need to adjust the path or use a package structure.\n\n- **Correct Import**: Instead of `from FileUtility import *`, it is generally better to use `from FileUtility import FileUtility` or simply `import FileUtility`. This makes the code clearer.\n\n### 3. Calling Static Methods\n\nWhen calling static methods, you should do so directly from the class:\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom FileUtility import FileUtility  # Ensure correct import\n\ndef main():\n    path = 'C:\\\\config_file_list.txt'  # Use double backslashes in Windows paths\n    dir = FileUtility.GetFilePath(path)\n    print(dir)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### 4. Clarifications\n\n- **Utility Class Necessity**: You do not necessarily need a utility class, but it can be a convenient way to group related functions together. If you prefer, you can also define these functions as standalone functions in a module and import them directly.\n\n- **Error Explanation**: The error message you encountered (`TypeError: GetFilePath() takes exactly 1 argument (2 given)`) was due to the incorrect inclusion of `self` in the static method definition.\n\nBy making these adjustments, your code should work correctly. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!"
