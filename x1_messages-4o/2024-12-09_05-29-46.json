How can I print and know the value of the `product` Tensor? When I try to print the product directly, it doesn't provide the actual value:\n\n```python\nprint product\nTensor(\"MatMul:0\", shape=TensorShape([Dimension(1), Dimension(1)]), dtype=float32)\n```\n\nI understand that graphs run on `Sessions`, but is there any way I can check the output of a `Tensor` object without running the graph in a `session`?"

        "content": "In TensorFlow 1.x, the computation graph needs to be executed inside a `Session` to evaluate the tensors and get their actual values. However, if you prefer not to use sessions and want to obtain the value directly, you can use TensorFlow 2.x, where eager execution is enabled by default. This means operations are computed immediately as they are called, and the results are returned as standard `numpy` arrays. Here's how you can do it:\n\nIf you are using TensorFlow 2.x, you can simply execute the operations and access the value directly without needing a session:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Define the constants\nmatrix1 = tf.constant([[3., 3.]])\nmatrix2 = tf.constant([[2.], [2.]])\n\n# Perform matrix multiplication\nproduct = tf.matmul(matrix1, matrix2)\n\n# Print the result directly\nprint(product.numpy())\n```\n\nIf you are sticking with TensorFlow 1.x or have eager execution disabled in TensorFlow 2.x, you would need to run the session as follows:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Define the constants\nmatrix1 = tf.constant([[3., 3.]])\nmatrix2 = tf.constant([[2.], [2.]])\n\n# Perform matrix multiplication\nproduct = tf.matmul(matrix1, matrix2)\n\n# Use a session to run the graph and obtain the result\nwith tf.Session() as sess:\n    result = sess.run(product)\n    print(result)\n```\n\nTo enable eager execution in TensorFlow 1.x, you can run the following command at the beginning of your script:\n\n```python\ntf.enable_eager_execution()\n```\n\nThis will allow you to evaluate tensors immediately as they are computed, similar to TensorFlow 2.x. Note that TensorFlow 2.x is the recommended version for new projects due to its simplicity and ease of use with eager execution."
