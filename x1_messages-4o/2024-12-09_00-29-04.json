        "content": "Installing `lxml` on OS X Leopard without using package managers like MacPorts or Fink can be a bit challenging due to the need to manually handle dependencies. Here is a detailed guide to help you through the process:\n\n### Step 1: Install Xcode and Command Line Tools\n1. **Download and Install Xcode**: \n   - Make sure you have Xcode installed on your system. You can find it on your OS X installation DVD or download it from Apple's developer website.\n\n2. **Install Command Line Tools**:\n   - Open Xcode, go to Preferences > Downloads, and install the Command Line Tools.\n\n### Step 2: Download and Install Dependencies\n`lxml` depends on `libxml2` and `libxslt`. You'll need to download and compile these libraries.\n\n#### 1. Download the Source Code\n- **libxml2**: Download from the [GNOME FTP](http://xmlsoft.org/sources/) or their [official website](http://xmlsoft.org).\n- **libxslt**: Download from the same sources as libxml2.\n\n#### 2. Compile and Install `libxml2`\n1. Extract the downloaded archive:\n   ```bash\n   tar -xzf libxml2-*.tar.gz\n   cd libxml2-*\n   ```\n\n2. Configure the build:\n   ```bash\n   ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --without-python\n   ```\n\n3. Compile and install:\n   ```bash\n   make\n   sudo make install\n   ```\n\n#### 3. Compile and Install `libxslt`\n1. Extract the downloaded archive:\n   ```bash\n   tar -xzf libxslt-*.tar.gz\n   cd libxslt-*\n   ```\n\n2. Configure the build:\n   ```bash\n   ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-libxml-prefix=/usr/local\n   ```\n\n3. Compile and install:\n   ```bash\n   make\n   sudo make install\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Install `lxml` using `pip`\n1. Ensure `pip` is installed. If not, install it:\n   ```bash\n   sudo easy_install pip\n   ```\n\n2. Use `pip` to install `lxml`:\n   ```bash\n   LDFLAGS=\"-L/usr/local/lib\" CFLAGS=\"-I/usr/local/include\" pip install lxml\n   ```\n\n### Step 4: Verify Installation\n1. Open Python in your terminal:\n   ```bash\n   python\n   ```\n\n2. Try importing `lxml`:\n   ```python\n   import lxml\n   print(lxml.__version__)\n   ```\n\nIf everything is set up correctly, this should print out the version of `lxml` you've installed.\n\n### Troubleshooting Tips\n- Ensure your environment variables like `PATH`, `CFLAGS`, and `LDFLAGS` are correctly set to the directories where you installed the libraries.\n- If you encounter errors, check the logs for missing dependencies or incorrect paths.\n- Make sure you have the necessary permissions to install software on your system (use `sudo` where required).\n\nThis guide should help you compile and install `lxml` and its dependencies manually on OS X Leopard."
