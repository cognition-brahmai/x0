        "content": "Yes, it is possible to use variables within Python's triple-quoted strings by using string formatting methods. There are several ways to achieve this in Python, such as using the old-style `%` formatting, the `str.format()` method, or f-strings (for Python 3.6 and above). I'll demonstrate each method with your example.\n\n### Method 1: Using `%` Formatting\nThis method is similar to your example and is compatible with older versions of Python.\n\n```python\nwash_clothes = 'tuesdays'\nclean_dishes = 'never'\n\nmystring = \"\"\"I like to wash clothes on %s\nI like to clean dishes %s\n\"\"\" % (wash_clothes, clean_dishes)\n\nprint(mystring)\n```\n\n### Method 2: Using `str.format()`\nThis is more modern than the `%` formatting and provides more functionality.\n\n```python\nwash_clothes = 'tuesdays'\nclean_dishes = 'never'\n\nmystring = \"\"\"I like to wash clothes on {0}\nI like to clean dishes {1}\n\"\"\".format(wash_clothes, clean_dishes)\n\nprint(mystring)\n```\n\n### Method 3: Using f-Strings (Python 3.6+)\nThis is the most recent and convenient method, allowing for inline expressions.\n\n```python\nwash_clothes = 'tuesdays'\nclean_dishes = 'never'\n\nmystring = f\"\"\"I like to wash clothes on {wash_clothes}\nI like to clean dishes {clean_dishes}\n\"\"\"\n\nprint(mystring)\n```\n\nEach of these methods will output:\n\n```\nI like to wash clothes on tuesdays\nI like to clean dishes never\n```\n\nFor handling large chunks of text with variables, f-strings are often the most readable and cleanest method, especially when dealing with multiple variables and expressions."
