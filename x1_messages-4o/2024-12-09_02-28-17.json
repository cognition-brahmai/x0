        "content": "To configure Visual Studio Code to debug a Python 3 project, you need to specify the Python 3 interpreter you want to use. Here are the steps to set it up:\n\n1. **Install Python Extension**: Make sure you have the Python extension for Visual Studio Code installed. You can find it in the Extensions Marketplace by searching for \"Python\" by Microsoft.\n\n2. **Select Python Interpreter**: \n   - Open your project folder in VS Code.\n   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) to open the command palette.\n   - Type `Python: Select Interpreter` and select it from the list.\n   - You will see a list of available Python interpreters. Select the Python 3 interpreter you wish to use for your project. If you have Python 3 installed, it should appear in the list. If not, you may need to install it or add it to your PATH.\n\n3. **Create or Modify `launch.json`**:\n   - Open the Debug view by clicking on the Debug icon in the Activity Bar on the side of VS Code.\n   - Click on the gear icon to configure the launch settings. If you don't have a `launch.json` file yet, it will prompt you to create one.\n   - In the `launch.json` file, you can specify the Python interpreter by adding `\"python\"` or `\"pythonPath\"` with the path to the Python 3 interpreter. If you have already selected the Python 3 interpreter, this may be automatically configured.\n   - Here's an example configuration for a Python 3 project:\n\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n       \"configurations\": [\n         {\n           \"name\": \"Python: Current File\",\n           \"type\": \"python\",\n           \"request\": \"launch\",\n           \"program\": \"${file}\",\n           \"console\": \"integratedTerminal\",\n           \"pythonPath\": \"${config:python.pythonPath}\"\n         }\n       ]\n     }\n     ```\n\n     The `\"pythonPath\": \"${config:python.pythonPath}\"` line ensures that VS Code uses the interpreter you selected earlier.\n\n4. **Verify the Environment**:\n   - Open a Python file in your project and check the bottom-left corner of the VS Code window. It should display the path to the Python 3 interpreter you selected.\n   - You can also verify by running a simple Python script (e.g., `print(sys.version)`) to ensure that Python 3 is being used.\n\n5. **Start Debugging**:\n   - Set breakpoints in your code by clicking in the gutter next to the line numbers.\n   - Press `F5` to start debugging, or go to the Debug view and click the green play button.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully configure and debug a Python 3 project in Visual Studio Code. If you encounter any issues, double-check that the correct Python 3 interpreter is selected and correctly configured in your `launch.json` file."
