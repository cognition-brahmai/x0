I am aware of methods using Graphlab, but I would prefer to stick with an open source solution. I have also looked at Sklearn and gensim, but I find them overwhelming. What would be the simplest solution for calculating tf-idf?"

        "content": "To calculate TF-IDF using Python and pandas without relying on external libraries like scikit-learn or gensim, you can manually compute the term frequency (TF), inverse document frequency (IDF), and then TF-IDF using basic pandas operations. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Term Frequency (TF)\nTF is simply the count of a term in a document divided by the total number of terms in the document.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'docId': [1, 2, 3], \n                   'sent': ['This is the first sentence', \n                            'This is the second sentence', \n                            'This is the third sentence']})\n\n# Function to calculate term frequency\ndef term_frequency(word_count):\n    tf_dict = {}\n    total_count = sum(word_count.values())\n    for word, count in word_count.items():\n        tf_dict[word] = count / total_count\n    return tf_dict\n\n# Word count function\ndef word_count(sent):\n    word2cnt = {}\n    for word in sent.split():\n        word2cnt[word] = word2cnt.get(word, 0) + 1\n    return word2cnt\n\n# Apply word count and term frequency\ndf['word_count'] = df['sent'].apply(word_count)\ndf['tf'] = df['word_count'].apply(term_frequency)\n```\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)\nIDF is calculated as the logarithm of the total number of documents divided by the number of documents containing the term.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Function to calculate IDF\ndef inverse_document_frequency(documents):\n    import math\n    N = len(documents)\n    idf_dict = {}\n    all_words = set(word for doc in documents for word in doc)\n    \n    for word in all_words:\n        containing_docs = sum(1 for doc in documents if word in doc)\n        idf_dict[word] = math.log(N / (1 + containing_docs))\n    return idf_dict\n\n# Calculate IDF\ndocuments = df['word_count'].tolist()\nidf = inverse_document_frequency(documents)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Calculate TF-IDF\nTF-IDF is the product of TF and IDF.\n\n```python\n# Function to calculate TF-IDF\ndef tf_idf(tf, idf):\n    tf_idf_dict = {}\n    for word, tf_value in tf.items():\n        tf_idf_dict[word] = tf_value * idf.get(word, 0)\n    return tf_idf_dict\n\n# Apply TF-IDF calculation\ndf['tf_idf'] = df['tf'].apply(lambda tf: tf_idf(tf, idf))\n```\n\n### Complete Code\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport math\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'docId': [1, 2, 3], \n                   'sent': ['This is the first sentence', \n                            'This is the second sentence', \n                            'This is the third sentence']})\n\n# Function to calculate word count\ndef word_count(sent):\n    word2cnt = {}\n    for word in sent.split():\n        word2cnt[word] = word2cnt.get(word, 0) + 1\n    return word2cnt\n\n# Function to calculate term frequency\ndef term_frequency(word_count):\n    tf_dict = {}\n    total_count = sum(word_count.values())\n    for word, count in word_count.items():\n        tf_dict[word] = count / total_count\n    return tf_dict\n\n# Function to calculate IDF\ndef inverse_document_frequency(documents):\n    N = len(documents)\n    idf_dict = {}\n    all_words = set(word for doc in documents for word in doc)\n    \n    for word in all_words:\n        containing_docs = sum(1 for doc in documents if word in doc)\n        idf_dict[word] = math.log(N / (1 + containing_docs))\n    return idf_dict\n\n# Function to calculate TF-IDF\ndef tf_idf(tf, idf):\n    tf_idf_dict = {}\n    for word, tf_value in tf.items():\n        tf_idf_dict[word] = tf_value * idf.get(word, 0)\n    return tf_idf_dict\n\n# Apply word count, TF, and IDF\ndf['word_count'] = df['sent'].apply(word_count)\ndf['tf'] = df['word_count'].apply(term_frequency)\ndocuments = df['word_count'].tolist()\nidf = inverse_document_frequency(documents)\n\n# Calculate and apply TF-IDF\ndf['tf_idf'] = df['tf'].apply(lambda tf: tf_idf(tf, idf))\n\n# Display the DataFrame with TF-IDF\nprint(df[['docId', 'tf_idf']])\n```\n\nThis code will give you a DataFrame where each document has a dictionary of TF-IDF scores for each word in that document. This solution uses pandas and Python's built-in libraries to compute TF-IDF manually."
