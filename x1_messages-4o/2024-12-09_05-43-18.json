But when I select certain rows and certain columns, I receive a ValueError: \"shape mismatch: objects cannot be broadcast to a single shape\". How can I select the 1st, 2nd, and 4th rows, and 1st and 3rd columns from a NumPy array? What am I doing wrong? Here is my code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.arange(20).reshape((5,4))\n\n# If I select certain rows, it works\nprint a[[0, 1, 3], :]\n\n# If I select certain rows and a single column, it works\nprint a[[0, 1, 3], 2]\n\n# But if I select certain rows AND certain columns, it fails\nprint a[[0,1,3], [0,2]]\n```\n\nAnd here is the error I am encountering:\n\n```python\n# Traceback (most recent call last):\n#   File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n# ValueError: shape mismatch: objects cannot be broadcast to a single shape\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to how NumPy handles advanced indexing. When you use `a[[0, 1, 3], [0, 2]]`, NumPy tries to select elements at positions (0,0), (1,2), and (3,0) because it pairs the row and column indices element-wise. This isn't what you want since you're trying to select a submatrix instead.\n\nTo select specific rows and columns and form a submatrix, you should use `np.ix_` to create an open mesh from multiple sequences. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.arange(20).reshape((5,4))\n\n# Use np.ix_ to create an index for rows and columns\nrows = np.array([0, 1, 3])\ncols = np.array([0, 2])\n\n# Select the submatrix\nresult = a[np.ix_(rows, cols)]\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will output the desired submatrix:\n\n```\n[[ 0  2]\n [ 4  6]\n [12 14]]\n```\n\nBy using `np.ix_`, you create a 2D grid of indices, allowing you to select the intersection of the specified rows and columns in the desired way."
