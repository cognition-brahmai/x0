The square root of 144 is 12.\n2. The sum of the digits in 12 is \\( 1 + 2 = 3 \\).\n3. 1 less than 3 is 2.\n\nHowever, \\(-7\\) does not satisfy the hint condition (multiple of 4 and 1 less than the sum of the digits in the square root of 144).\n\nIt seems there might be a discrepancy, so let's check the code logic you provided:\n\n```scala\nval x = 5\nval y = (3*(x-2) - 2*(x+3)) % 4 + math.sqrt(144).toInt % 10 - 1\n```\n\nBreaking down the Scala code logic:\n1. \\( 3(x-2) - 2(x+3) = 3(5-2) - 2(5+3) = 9 - 16 = -7 \\)\n2. \\(-7 \\% 4 = -3\\) (in Scala, -7 % 4 equals -3)\n3. \\(\\text{sqrt}(144) = 12\\), and \\(12 \\% 10 = 2\\)\n4. Then, \\(-3 + 2 - 1 = -2\\)\n\nThe correct value of \\( y \\) based on the code logic is \\(-2\\), which seems to align with the hint given the constraints. Since \\(-2\\) is not a multiple of 4, the initial interpretation of the hint seems to be incorrect or not applicable to the solution found via the equation."
