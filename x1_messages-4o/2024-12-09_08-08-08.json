I've shifted the repository to use 'tox' and 'pytest-cov', and modified the original tests to use 'pytester' as recommended in the pytest documentation for testing plugins. The tests and 'tox' build operate fine, but the coverage reports false misses for elements like class definitions and imports. This is because the code is imported during pytest instantiation and doesn't get covered until testing begins. Despite trying various configurations and going through pytest, pytest-cov, coverage, and tox documents, I can't seem to fix this. My repository layout and relevant snippets are provided below. How can I get an accurate coverage report? Is there a way to delay plugin loading until the pytester tests demand it?"

        "content": "This is a common issue when dealing with pytest plugins and coverage reporting. The problem stems from the way pytest-cov tracks coverage during test execution, particularly with code that is imported and executed during test discovery or plugin initialization. Fortunately, there are a few strategies you can employ to improve the accuracy of your coverage reports:\n\n1. **Configure the `conftest.py` file:** Ensure that your `conftest.py` is not importing your plugin code directly. Instead, delay any imports or executions until they are needed by your tests. This can help ensure that the code is covered during test execution.\n\n2. **Use `pytest-cov`'s `--cov-append` option:** When running tests, use the `--cov-append` option. This ensures that coverage data is appended rather than overwritten. This can help combine coverage data from different test sessions, particularly if different parts of your code are covered in different sessions.\n\n3. **Modify the `tox.ini` or `setup.cfg` for coverage configuration:**\n   - Add `--cov-append` and `--cov-config` options in your `tox.ini` or `setup.cfg` to ensure consistent behavior.\n   - Example configuration in `tox.ini`:\n     ```ini\n     [testenv]\n     deps = \n       pytest\n       pytest-cov\n     commands =\n       pytest --cov=my_plugin --cov-append --cov-report=term-missing\n     ```\n\n4. **Use `pytester` fixture wisely:** Ensure that your tests using `pytester` are structured to explicitly invoke the parts of the plugin you wish to test. This may involve restructuring tests so that they focus more directly on the plugin's functionality rather than relying on implicit execution paths.\n\n5. **Check for any coverage configuration issues:** Ensure that your coverage configuration file (e.g., `.coveragerc`) correctly includes the directories you want to measure and excludes any that are irrelevant. Example `.coveragerc`:\n   ```ini\n   [run]\n   branch = True\n   source = my_plugin\n   parallel = True\n\n   [report]\n   omit =\n     */tests/*\n     .tox/*\n   ```\n\n6. **Run coverage separately:** As a last resort, you might want to run the coverage measurement separately from the test execution. First, execute your tests without coverage, then execute them with coverage in a separate pass, ensuring that the environment is the same.\n\nIf these strategies don't resolve the issue, consider reviewing the plugin's entry points and initialization code. Simplifying and delaying any execution until absolutely necessary can help prevent premature execution during pytest's initial import phase.\n\nBy following these strategies, you should be able to obtain a more accurate coverage report for your pytest plugin repository."
