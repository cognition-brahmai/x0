Let's break it down:\n\n1. **`(\\b[a-z]+)`**: This part of the regular expression is a capturing group defined by the parentheses `()`. It matches a word boundary `\\b` followed by one or more lowercase alphabetic characters `[a-z]+`. This captures a word composed of lowercase letters.\n\n2. **`\\1`**: This is a backreference to the content captured by the first capturing group `(\\b[a-z]+)`. It refers to the exact text that was matched by this group.\n\n3. **The Whole Expression**: `(\\b[a-z]+) \\1` matches a word followed by a space and then the same word again. For example, it matches \"the the\" because \"the\" is captured by the first group, and `\\1` references this captured word after the space.\n\n4. **`re.sub` Replacement**: The `re.sub` function is used to substitute occurrences in a string. In this case, it looks for patterns in the input string that match the regular expression and replaces them with the content of the first capturing group `\\1`. Therefore, the matched text \"the the\" is replaced with just \"the\".\n\nApplying this to the string `'cat in the the hat'`, the result of `re.sub(r'(\\b[a-z]+) \\1', r'\\1', 'cat in the the hat')` will be `'cat in the hat'`. The duplicate \"the\" is removed."
