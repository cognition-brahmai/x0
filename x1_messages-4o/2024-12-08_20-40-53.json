];\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- The move constructor allows resources to be transferred rather than copied, reducing the overhead of copying large amounts of data.\n- This is particularly beneficial when returning large objects from functions, as it avoids unnecessary copying and thus speeds up execution.\n\nThese techniques, when used appropriately, can lead to significant performance improvements in your C++ applications."
