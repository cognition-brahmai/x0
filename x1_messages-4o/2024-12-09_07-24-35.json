        "content": "To achieve the desired output format in your YAML file, you'll need to adjust how the YAML data is being written to the file. The issue you're facing, where the output format is \"{user: id}\", suggests that the data is being serialized as a dictionary in a compact form. To change this behavior, you can customize the YAML dump process.\n\nHere's a simple example of how you can achieve the desired output format using the `yaml` library in Python:\n\n```python\nimport yaml\n\n# Sample data\ndata = {\n    'user': 'id'\n}\n\n# Define a custom YAML representer to avoid compact formatting\ndef custom_represent_dict(dumper, data):\n    return dumper.represent_mapping('tag:yaml.org,2002:map', data.items())\n\n# Register the custom representer for dict\nyaml.add_representer(dict, custom_represent_dict)\n\n# Write to x.yml with the desired format\nwith open('x.yml', 'w') as file:\n    yaml.dump(data, file, default_flow_style=False)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Custom Representer:** We define a custom representer for dictionaries that ensures the data is serialized in a non-compact form.\n- **`default_flow_style=False`:** This argument in `yaml.dump()` makes sure that the YAML is written in block style rather than flow style.\n- **YAML Library:** Ensure you have the `PyYAML` library installed. You can install it using `pip install pyyaml`.\n\nBy utilizing the custom representer and setting `default_flow_style` to `False`, you should be able to achieve the output format \"user: id\" in your `x.yml` file."
