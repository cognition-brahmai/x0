Below is the code I am using:\n\n```python\n#jurassic park mainframe\n\nfrom random import randint\nfrom sys import exit\nfrom comm_system import Comm_system #the file i want to import from\n\nclass Jpark_mainframe(object):\n    #... rest of the code...\n    if prompt == \"Communications Systems\":\n        print \"===========Communications Systems===========\"\n        print \"error: 'comm_link' missing in directories\"\n        exit(0)\n    return Comm_system.run #this is where I want to return the \n                                           #the other file\nthe_game = jpark_mainframe()\nthe_game.mainframe_home()\n```\n\nWhen importing the file, it first runs the class with `run()` in it and then proceeds to run the original code. I want to return a function called `run()` from a class in another file. Can you explain why this is happening and how can I correctly return the `run()` function from the imported file? Here is the code from the `comm_system` file:\n\n```python\n#communication systems\n\nfrom sys import exit\n\nclass Comm_system(object):\ndef run(self):\n    #... rest of the code...\na_game = Comm_system()\na_game.run()\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering stems from the fact that when you import a module, all top-level code in that module is executed immediately. In your `comm_system` file, the instantiation of `Comm_system` and the call to `run()` are outside of any function or class method, so they are executed right away when you import `comm_system`.\n\nTo fix this, you should ensure that the code in `comm_system` that creates an instance of `Comm_system` and calls `run()` is inside a function or under a condition that prevents it from executing during import. Here's how you can modify the `comm_system` file:\n\n```python\n# communication systems\n\nfrom sys import exit\n\nclass Comm_system(object):\n    def run(self):\n        # ... rest of the code...\n\n# Ensure this code only runs when the file is executed directly\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    a_game = Comm_system()\n    a_game.run()\n\n```\n\nNow, when you import `Comm_system` in your `jurassic park mainframe` file, the `run()` method won't be executed immediately. Instead, you'll need to create an instance of `Comm_system` and call `run()` yourself when you need it.\n\nHere's how you might adjust your mainframe code:\n\n```python\n# jurassic park mainframe\n\nfrom random import randint\nfrom sys import exit\nfrom comm_system import Comm_system  # the file to import from\n\nclass Jpark_mainframe(object):\n    def mainframe_home(self):\n        # ... rest of the code ...\n        prompt = \"Communications Systems\"  # this should be set appropriately in your code\n        if prompt == \"Communications Systems\":\n            print(\"===========Communications Systems===========\")\n            print(\"error: 'comm_link' missing in directories\")\n            exit(0)\n        comm_system = Comm_system()  # Create an instance of Comm_system\n        return comm_system.run()     # Call the run method\n\nthe_game = Jpark_mainframe()\nthe_game.mainframe_home()\n```\n\nEnsure that `prompt` is being set correctly in your code, as it's currently hardcoded to `\"Communications Systems\"` in this snippet. Adjust it according to your actual implementation logic."
