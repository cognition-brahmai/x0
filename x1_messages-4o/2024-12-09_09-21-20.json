Here's a sample query that assumes you have a table named `customers` with a column `last_name`:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM customers\nWHERE last_name LIKE 'A%';\n```\n\nThis query selects all columns for rows in the `customers` table where the `last_name` begins with the letter 'A'. The `%` is a wildcard character that represents zero or more characters, so `'A%'` matches any last name starting with 'A'."
