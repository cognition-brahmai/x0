        "content": "To extract just the contents of the `<title>` tag using a regular expression, you can use a capturing group. Capturing groups allow you to extract specific parts of the match. Here's how you can modify your regular expression to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nhtml = \"<html><head><title>Example Title</title></head><body>...</body></html>\"\n\n# Use a capturing group to extract the content within the <title> tag\ntitle_match = re.search(r'<title>(.*?)</title>', html, re.IGNORECASE)\n\n# Check if a match was found and extract the content\nif title_match:\n    title = title_match.group(1)  # Use group(1) to get the content inside the capturing group\n    print(title)\nelse:\n    print(\"Title tag not found.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- The `.*?` inside the capturing group `(<title>(.*?)</title>)` is a non-greedy match that captures as little text as possible between `<title>` and `</title>`.\n- `group(1)` returns the content inside the first capturing group, which is the text inside the `<title>` tags.\n- This approach avoids the need to use `replace` and directly gives you the text content of the `<title>` tag."
