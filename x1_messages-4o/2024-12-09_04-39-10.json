Is it possible that the time precision is lost forever for old processes?"

        "content": "The `ps` command in Linux indeed has limitations when it comes to displaying the start time of processes that have been running for a long time. By default, `ps` shows the start time in the format of \"HH:MM\" if the process started on the current day, \"MMM DD\" if it started earlier in the current year, and just the year if it started in a previous year. Unfortunately, the granularity of the start time for old processes is not maintained in the output of `ps`.\n\nHowever, there are a few alternative approaches you could consider to retrieve more precise information about the start time of a process:\n\n1. **Check System Logs**: If the logging level is set appropriately, system logs such as `/var/log/syslog` or `/var/log/messages` might contain entries related to the process start time. Use commands like `grep` to search these logs for entries related to the process.\n\n2. **Use `proc` Filesystem**: You can check the `/proc/[pid]/stat` file, where `[pid]` is the process ID. The `btime` value from `/proc/stat` can be used to calculate the start time. The 22nd field in `/proc/[pid]/stat` gives the process start time in clock ticks since boot, which you can convert to real time with the system's clock tick rate (obtained via `sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)`). Here's a basic example:\n\n    ```bash\n    pid=your_process_id\n    start_time=$(awk '{print $22}' /proc/$pid/stat)\n    clock_ticks=$(getconf CLK_TCK)\n    btime=$(awk '{print $1}' /proc/stat | grep btime)\n    process_uptime=$(($start_time / $clock_ticks))\n    system_uptime=$(awk '{print int($1)}' /proc/uptime)\n    process_start_seconds=$(($btime + $system_uptime - $process_uptime))\n    echo \"Process started at: $(date -d @$process_start_seconds)\"\n    ```\n\n3. **Use `uptime` and `ps` Together**: Although this won't give you the exact time, you can estimate the start time by using the system's uptime (`uptime` command) and the process's elapsed time (`ps -p [pid] -o etime`).\n\n4. **Process Accounting**: If you have process accounting enabled (using `accton` and `sa` commands), you might have detailed logs of process start and stop times, though this is typically used for auditing and might not be enabled by default.\n\nFor long-running processes, the precision of the start time is often not critical, but if it is, you might need to ensure that you have adequate logging in place for future needs."
