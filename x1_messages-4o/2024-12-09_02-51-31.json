For instance, 'words' should return 'word' and 'did' should return 'do'. Can someone guide me on how to achieve this?"

        "content": "Certainly! SpaCy is a powerful library for natural language processing in Python and it includes a lemmatizer that can help you get the base form of words. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use SpaCy's lemmatizer:\n\n1. **Install SpaCy**: If you haven't installed SpaCy yet, you can do so using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install spacy\n   ```\n\n2. **Download a Language Model**: SpaCy requires a language model to function. For English, you can download the `en_core_web_sm` model:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm\n   ```\n\n3. **Write a Script to Use the Lemmatizer**: You can use the following script to lemmatize words in a string:\n\n   ```python\n   import spacy\n\n   # Load the SpaCy model\n   nlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n   # Input string\n   text = \"words did running\"\n\n   # Process the text with SpaCy\n   doc = nlp(text)\n\n   # Print the lemmatized forms\n   for token in doc:\n       print(f\"{token.text} -> {token.lemma_}\")\n   ```\n\n   This script will output:\n\n   ```\n   words -> word\n   did -> do\n   running -> run\n   ```\n\n4. **Explanation**:\n   - We first import SpaCy and load the language model using `spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")`.\n   - We then process the input text using the model which returns a `Doc` object.\n   - Finally, we iterate through each token in the `Doc` object and print out the original text and its lemmatized form using `token.text` and `token.lemma_`.\n\nThis should give you the basic forms of the words in your input string.
