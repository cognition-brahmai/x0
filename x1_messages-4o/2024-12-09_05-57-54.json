I want to continue using the notebook for further analysis but the 12 GB of GPU memory remains occupied after finishing training as observed from `nvtop`. Restarting the notebook's kernel is not a viable solution because I want to continue using the same notebook and its respective output computed so far."

        "content": "Clearing GPU memory in PyTorch without restarting the Jupyter Notebook kernel can be challenging, but there are several strategies you can try to release the memory:\n\n1. **Delete Unused Variables**: Ensure that all variables related to your model and data are deleted. You can use Python's `del` statement to delete these variables. For example:\n\n   ```python\n   del model\n   del optimizer\n   del data\n   ```\n\n2. **Clear Cache**: PyTorch provides functionality to explicitly clear the CUDA cache:\n\n   ```python\n   import torch\n   torch.cuda.empty_cache()\n   ```\n\n   This function does not free up the memory occupied by variables, but it can help in reducing fragmentation.\n\n3. **Use `gc` Module**: Python's garbage collection can sometimes need a nudge to free up memory:\n\n   ```python\n   import gc\n   gc.collect()\n   ```\n\n4. **Set Tensor to CPU**: If you have large tensors that you no longer need, move them to CPU before deletion:\n\n   ```python\n   tensor = tensor.cpu()\n   del tensor\n   ```\n\n5. **Reinitialize CUDA Context**: In some cases, reinitializing the CUDA context might help:\n\n   ```python\n   torch.cuda.synchronize()\n   torch.cuda.empty_cache()\n   ```\n\n6. **Debugging**: To find out which objects are still holding memory, you might need more exploratory approaches, such as:\n\n   ```python\n   for obj in gc.get_objects():\n       try:\n           if torch.is_tensor(obj) or (hasattr(obj, 'data') and torch.is_tensor(obj.data)):\n               print(type(obj), obj.size())\n       except:\n           pass\n   ```\n\n7. **Check for Live References**: Ensure that there are no live references to the objects you want to clear. Sometimes, hidden references in closures or other parts of your code can hold onto objects.\n\nBy combining these methods, you should be able to free up GPU memory without restarting your notebook's kernel. However, it's important to note that if you still face issues, sometimes restarting the kernel might be the easiest solution if feasible."
