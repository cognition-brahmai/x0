I am creating \"controller\" classes to separate the event-driven part from the UI definition, which is generated from Qt Designer files. I am using multiple inheritance for these classes. However, I am encountering a 'metaclass conflict' error when I subclass `BaseController` and try to inherit from the subclass instead of `BaseController`. The error message is as follows: `TypeError: Error when calling the metaclass bases metaclass conflict: the metaclass of a derived class must be a (non-strict) subclass of the metaclasses of all its bases`. How can I resolve this error?"

        "content": "The \"metaclass conflict\" error you're encountering typically occurs when you attempt to use multiple inheritance with classes that have different metaclasses. In Python, the metaclass of a derived class must be a subclass of the metaclasses of all its base classes. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Identify Metaclasses**: Determine the metaclasses of the base classes you're trying to inherit from. In PyQt4/PySide, the metaclass is often `sip.wrappertype` for PyQt and `Shiboken.ObjectType` for PySide. You can find this out by checking the `__class__` attribute of the class.\n\n2. **Create a Common Metaclass**: If the base classes have different metaclasses, you need to create a common metaclass that inherits from these metaclasses. This ensures that the derived class only has one metaclass, which respects the hierarchy requirements.\n\n3. **Define a Custom Metaclass**: Here's a basic example to illustrate how you might handle this:\n\n   ```python\n   from PySide import QtGui\n\n   # Example of a custom metaclass inheriting from metaclasses of the conflicting classes\n   class MyMeta(type(QtGui.QWidget), type):\n       pass\n\n   # BaseController already using an appropriate metaclass\n   class BaseController(QtGui.QWidget):\n       __metaclass__ = MyMeta\n       # Your controller logic here\n\n   # Subclass of BaseController\n   class MyController(BaseController):\n       # Additional logic or overrides here\n       pass\n   ```\n\n4. **Ensure Consistency**: Make sure that any new base classes also use the same metaclass. If you're using PyQt or PySide, you might need to ensure that any common base class, like `QtGui.QWidget`, uses the same custom metaclass.\n\n5. **Refactor if Necessary**: If creating a common metaclass seems too complex or not feasible, consider refactoring your design to reduce the need for multiple inheritance or to implement composition instead.\n\n6. **Use Mixins**: In some designs, using mixins to add functionality without creating metaclass conflicts can be a good strategy.\n\nBy ensuring a common metaclass or refactoring your class hierarchy, you can resolve the metaclass conflict error. Always test thoroughly after making these changes to ensure your application behaves as expected."
