But be warned, there's a catch! Each scenario has a hidden code that you must decipher in order to select the correct answer. \nScenario 1: The level of goal realism is highly achievable, but the potential consequences of not meeting the goal are severe. Use the code below to input your answer.\nA) The impact on motivation is high.\nB) The impact on effort is moderate.\nC) The impact on performance is low.\nScenario 2: The level of goal realism is moderately achievable, but the potential consequences of not meeting the goal are mild. Use the code below to input your answer.\nA) The impact on motivation is low.\nB) The impact on effort is high.\nC) The impact on performance is moderate.\nScenario 3: The level of goal realism is unattainable, but the potential consequences of not meeting the goal are negligible. Use the code below to input your answer.\nA) The impact on motivation is moderate.\nB) The impact on effort is low.\nC) The impact on performance is high.\nGood luck, and happy deciphering!"

        "content": "To tackle the Goal Realism Puzzle Challenge, let's analyze each scenario and its potential impacts on motivation, effort, and performance. We need to match the level of goal realism with its corresponding impact based on the given conditions.\n\n### Scenario 1:\n- **Level of Goal Realism**: Highly achievable\n- **Consequences of Not Meeting the Goal**: Severe\n\nGiven that the goal is highly achievable but with severe consequences for not meeting it, people are likely to be highly motivated to achieve it to avoid negative repercussions. Therefore, the impact on motivation is high.\n\n**Answer for Scenario 1:**\n- A) The impact on motivation is high.\n\n### Scenario 2:\n- **Level of Goal Realism**: Moderately achievable\n- **Consequences of Not Meeting the Goal**: Mild\n\nFor a moderately achievable goal with mild consequences, individuals might not feel as pressured, leading to a lower motivation but might put in a decent amount of effort to achieve it. Thus, the impact on effort is high.\n\n**Answer for Scenario 2:**\n- B) The impact on effort is high.\n\n### Scenario 3:\n- **Level of Goal Realism**: Unattainable\n- **Consequences of Not Meeting the Goal**: Negligible\n\nWhen a goal is unattainable and there are negligible consequences, motivation to pursue the goal tends to be low, and so does the effort. Despite this, if attempted, the performance might suffer due to the unattainability, but given the options, the effort is likely to be the lowest.\n\n**Answer for Scenario 3:**\n- B) The impact on effort is low.\n\nThese answers align the levels of goal realism with their respective impacts based on the scenarios provided."
