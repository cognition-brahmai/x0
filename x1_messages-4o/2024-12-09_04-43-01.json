However, when Googlebot tries to access a similar URL, '/vi/5907399890173952.html%7D%7D', it generates an exception. How can I handle this as an exception? The error message from Python is: \n\n```\n /vi/5251302833520640.html%7D%7D 404 20ms 0kb Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html) module=default version=release140319\n66.249.67.109 - - [19/Mar/2014:07:53:32 -0700] \"GET /vi/5251302833520640.html%7D%7D HTTP/1.1\" 404 84 - \"Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html)\" ms=21 cpu_ms=0 cpm_usd=0.000009 app_engine_release=1.9.1 instance=00c61b117c0bc0f980f2a37a6ac534786055d3ab\nE 2014-03-19 15:53:32.678\nget() takes exactly 3 arguments (2 given)\n```\nFor the URL, I am using the regex `('/vi/(\\d+)(\\.html?)?', NewHandler)`.

        "content": "The character sequence `%7D` in a URL represents the closing brace `}` in URL encoding. In your case, the URL `/vi/5907399890173952.html%7D%7D` decodes to `/vi/5907399890173952.html}}`.\n\nThe exception is likely occurring because the regex pattern you are using (`'/vi/(\\d+)(\\.html?)?'`) does not account for additional characters such as `}}` at the end of the URL. This is why your handler doesn't recognize the URL, leading to a 404 error.\n\nHere are a few steps to handle this exception:\n\n1. **Update Your Regex**: Modify your regex to handle unexpected trailing characters. You can do this by making the trailing characters optional. For example, you could use `('/vi/(\\d+)(\\.html?)?(\\%7D%7D)?', NewHandler)` to handle cases where `}}` might be appended.\n\n2. **Sanitize Input in Templates**: If the issue is stemming from the Jinja2 template, ensure that the data output is correctly sanitized. The double `}}` could be the result of a template variable or logic error. Double-check the logic in your template to ensure that no extra braces are being appended to the generated URLs.\n\n3. **Handle Unexpected URLs Gracefully**: Implement error handling in your application to manage unexpected URL patterns gracefully. This can include redirecting to a valid URL, displaying a custom error message, or logging additional information for debugging.\n\n4. **Check Googlebot Configuration**: Ensure there are no misconfigurations or errors in how Googlebot is accessing your URLs. Sometimes crawlers might add unexpected parameters or characters to URLs.\n\n5. **Debugging**: Use logging to capture the exact URLs being accessed and any exceptions being thrown. This will help diagnose if there are specific cases causing the issue.\n\nBy addressing these points, you should be able to prevent the exceptions from causing issues when Googlebot accesses your URLs."
