I could just match anything starting with GBP, but I would prefer to look for certain delimiters around it. I've attempted to use the Python 're' module for this task, but I'm having trouble getting it to match both at the start of a string and when there's a whitespace prefix. My current code looks like this:\n\n```python\nimport re\ntext = u'GBP 5 Off when you spend GBP75.00'\nre.sub(ur'GBP([\\W\\d])', ur'\u00a3\\g<1>', text) # matches GBP with any prefix\nre.sub(ur'^GBP([\\W\\d])', ur'\u00a3\\g<1>', text) # matches at start only\nre.sub(ur'(\\W)GBP([\\W\\d])', ur'\\g<1>\u00a3\\g<2>', text) # matches whitespace prefix only\n```\nIs there a way to match both the start of the string and the whitespace prefix at the same time?"

        "content": "Yes, you can create a regular expression that matches either a whitespace or the start of a string. You can use the `|` operator, which acts as a logical \"or\" in regular expressions, to achieve this. Here's how you can modify your code to match GBP with either a whitespace prefix or at the start of the string:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ntext = u'GBP 5 Off when you spend GBP75.00'\n\n# Use re.sub to replace GBP with \u00a3, accounting for whitespace or start of string\nresult = re.sub(r'(^|\\s)GBP(?=\\W|\\d)', r'\\1\u00a3', text)\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `(^|\\s)` matches either the start of the string `^` or a whitespace `\\s`.\n- `GBP` is the literal text you're looking to replace.\n- `(?=\\W|\\d)` is a lookahead assertion that ensures GBP is followed by a non-word character or a digit, which matches your original pattern of `([\\W\\d])`.\n- `\\1\u00a3` replaces the matched part with the first capturing group (either start of string or whitespace) followed by the \u00a3 symbol.\n\nThis pattern will correctly replace GBP with \u00a3 when GBP is at the start of the string or preceded by a whitespace."
