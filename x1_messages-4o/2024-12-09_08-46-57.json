        "content": "How can I change the projection of an existing axis in a matplotlib subplot? I am trying to create a function that takes a subplot instance (matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot) and transforms its projection to another one, say, to one of the cartopy.crs.CRS projections. I have considered using the fig.add_subplot() function. However, I am looking for a proper matplotlib method that could help me change a subplot axis projection after it has been defined. Here's the idea I'm working with:\n\n```python\nimport cartopy.crs as ccrs\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef make_ax_map(ax, projection=ccrs.PlateCarree()):\n    # set ax projection to the specified projection\n    ...\n    # other fancy formatting\n    ax2.coastlines()\n    ...\n\n# Create a grid of plots\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(ncols=2)\n# the first subplot remains unchanged\nax1.plot(np.random.rand(10))\n# the second one gets another projection\nmake_ax_map(ax2)\n```\n\nThe fig.add_subplot() function works like this:\n\n```python\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))\nax1 = fig.add_subplot(121)\nax1.plot(np.random.rand(10))\n\nax2 = fig.add_subplot(122,projection=ccrs.PlateCarree())\nax2.coastlines()\n```"

        "content": "Changing the projection of an existing `matplotlib` axis is not directly supported because the projection is typically set during the creation of the axis. However, you can work around this limitation by removing the existing axis and creating a new one with the desired projection in the same position. Here's how you can implement this in your `make_ax_map` function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport cartopy.crs as ccrs\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef make_ax_map(ax, projection=ccrs.PlateCarree()):\n    # Get the figure object from the existing axis\n    fig = ax.figure\n    \n    # Get the original position of the axis\n    pos = ax.get_position()\n    \n    # Remove the original axis\n    ax.remove()\n    \n    # Add a new axis with the desired projection at the same position\n    ax_new = fig.add_axes(pos, projection=projection)\n    \n    # Add coastlines or other map features\n    ax_new.coastlines()\n    \n    # Return the new axis in case further customization is needed\n    return ax_new\n\n# Create a grid of plots\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(ncols=2)\n\n# Plot on the first subplot\nax1.plot(np.random.rand(10))\n\n# Change the projection of the second subplot\nax2 = make_ax_map(ax2)\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Removing and Replacing the Axis**: The function `make_ax_map` first captures the position of the existing axis, removes it, and then creates a new axis in the same position with the specified projection.\n  \n- **Using `fig.add_axes`**: Instead of `fig.add_subplot`, `fig.add_axes` is used with a position argument to specify the exact location where the new axis should be placed.\n\n- **Returning the New Axis**: The function returns the newly created axis in case you want to perform further modifications on it after changing its projection.\n\nBy following this approach, you can effectively change the projection of an axis within a subplot in `matplotlib`."
