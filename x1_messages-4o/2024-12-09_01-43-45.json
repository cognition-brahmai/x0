The DataFrame is composed of register transactions and has a shape of (500,4) with 'Time' as datetime64[ns], 'Net Total' as float64, 'Tax' as float64, and 'Total Due' as float64. I am trying to sort the DataFrame by any column using the `sort_values` function but the order of the results does not change regardless of the column title or boolean argument I use. I have tried previewing the results using `print(df)`, `df.head()`, and `HTML(df.to_html())` but the problem persists. I am working in a Python3 Jupyter notebook and I am not sure if this is causing the issue. What could be causing this issue and how can I resolve it to correctly sort my DataFrame?"

        "content": "If you're experiencing issues with sorting your DataFrame and seeing no apparent changes, there might be a few reasons behind this. Let's go through some potential causes and solutions:\n\n1. **Sorting in Place**: Ensure you are either sorting the DataFrame in place or assigning the result of the sort back to your DataFrame. By default, `sort_values()` returns a new DataFrame and does not modify the original one unless you specify `inplace=True`.\n\n   ```python\n   # Option 1: Sort in place\n   df.sort_values(by='Net Total', inplace=True)\n\n   # Option 2: Assign back to the DataFrame\n   df = df.sort_values(by='Net Total')\n   ```\n\n2. **Check for Index Issues**: Sometimes, the index might be affecting how you perceive the sorted DataFrame. Resetting the index can help ensure you're viewing the data correctly.\n\n   ```python\n   df = df.sort_values(by='Net Total').reset_index(drop=True)\n   ```\n\n3. **Sorting by the Correct Column Name**: Double-check that you are using the exact column name, accounting for any potential typos or whitespace issues.\n\n4. **DataFrame View in Jupyter**: Sometimes Jupyter Notebook's cached output can give the illusion that the DataFrame hasn\u2019t changed. Clear the output and re-run the cell to ensure you're seeing the updated DataFrame.\n\n5. **Data Types**: Confirm that the data types are correct and consistent, especially if you're sorting by 'Time'. Ensure that 'Time' is indeed of datetime64[ns] type.\n\n   ```python\n   print(df.dtypes)\n   ```\n\n   If 'Time' is not datetime64[ns], convert it:\n\n   ```python\n   df['Time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Time'])\n   ```\n\n6. **Jupyter Notebook Kernel**: If the problem persists, try restarting the kernel and running your notebook again.\n\n7. **Environment Issues**: Ensure there are no environment-specific issues or conflicting installations that might affect Pandas behavior.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, consider creating a minimal reproducible example and check if the problem persists. This can help isolate whether the issue is with the specific dataset or the environment setup."
