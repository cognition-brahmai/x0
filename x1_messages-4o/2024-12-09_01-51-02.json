The error message I receive is \"NameError:name 'cross_validation' is not defined\". The line of code I'm running is: \n\n```\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = cross_validation.train_test_split(X,y,test_size=0.2)\n```\n\nI'm using sklearn version 0.19.1. Can someone help me rectify this?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is because the `cross_validation` module has been deprecated in newer versions of scikit-learn, and you're using an older approach to import the function. In scikit-learn version 0.18 and later, the `cross_validation` module was moved to `model_selection`. \n\nTo fix the error, you should import `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection` instead of `cross_validation`. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)\n```\n\nThis should resolve the `NameError` and allow you to split your data into training and testing sets. Make sure to replace any other instances of `cross_validation` with `model_selection` in your code if you're using other functions from that module."
