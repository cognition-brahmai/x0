        "content": "To include static files in your Python package using `setuptools`, you need to ensure a few key points are addressed in your `setup.py` configuration. Here's how you can adjust your setup to include `static/data.txt` and `Potato/potatoData.txt`:\n\n1. **Correct `package_data` Usage**: The `package_data` parameter should be used to specify files that are located within your packages. The dictionary keys should correspond to package names (or `''` for all packages), and the values should be lists of patterns matching the files to include.\n\n2. **Manifest File**: Sometimes, it's necessary to use a `MANIFEST.in` file to explicitly state which files should be included in the source distribution. This is particularly useful for non-Python files.\n\n3. **File Paths**: Ensure that the paths provided in `package_data` are relative to the package directories.\n\nHere's how you can adjust your setup:\n\n### `setup.py`\n```python\nfrom setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\nsetup(\n    name=\"PotatoProject\",\n    version=\"0.1.1\",\n    author=\"Master Splinter\",\n    author_email=\"splinter@initech.com\",\n    description=(\"The potatoproject!\"),\n    url='http://www.google.com',\n    license=\"BSD\",\n\n    packages=find_packages('src'),\n    package_dir={'': 'src'},\n\n    # Include package data\n    include_package_data=True,\n\n    # Specify package data\n    package_data={\n        'Potato': ['*.txt'],  # Include txt files in the Potato package\n        '': ['static/*.txt'],  # Include txt files in the static directory\n    },\n\n    scripts=['src/startPotato'],\n    classifiers=[\n        \"Development Status :: 3 - Alpha\",\n        \"Topic :: Utilities\",\n        \"License :: OSI Approved :: BSD License\",\n    ],\n)\n```\n\n### `MANIFEST.in`\nCreate a `MANIFEST.in` file in the root directory (same level as `setup.py`) with the following content:\n\n```\ninclude src/Potato/*.txt\ninclude src/static/*.txt\n```\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- **`include_package_data=True`**: This tells `setuptools` to include files specified in `MANIFEST.in`.\n\n- **Package Structure**: Make sure that the package structure is correctly set up and the files you want to include are indeed where you specify them.\n\n- **Building the Package**: After making these changes, clean any previously built distributions using `python setup.py clean` and then rebuild using `python setup.py sdist`.\n\nBy ensuring that the `package_data` and `MANIFEST.in` are correctly configured, you should be able to include the desired static files in your package distribution."
