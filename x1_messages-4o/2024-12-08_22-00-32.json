        "content": "To modify the SQL query to exclude actions that have similar effects to pineapple, such as reducing joint pain or improving digestion, you need to expand the criteria in the `WHERE` clause. Assuming the effects are listed in a column named `effect`, you can add additional conditions to exclude these specific effects. Here's a general way to modify the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM actions\nWHERE effect NOT IN ('reducing inflammation', 'reducing joint pain', 'improving digestion');\n```\n\nThis query filters out any actions that have the effects of reducing inflammation, joint pain, or improving digestion. If there are other effects you want to exclude, simply add them to the list within the `NOT IN` clause. Adjust the column and table names as needed to fit your database schema."
