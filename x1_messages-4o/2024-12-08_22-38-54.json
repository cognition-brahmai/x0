        "content": "Creating a full-fledged chess game in Python with all the functionalities such as moving pieces, checking for a winner, checkmate, and stalemate requires a substantial amount of code. Below is a simplified version that provides a basic framework for such a game. This code will include piece movements and functions to check for checkmate and stalemate. Note that this is a basic representation and may not cover all the rules and edge cases of chess.\n\n```python\nclass ChessGame:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # Initialize the board with pieces in starting positions\n        self.board = [\n            [\"R\", \"N\", \"B\", \"Q\", \"K\", \"B\", \"N\", \"R\"],\n            [\"P\", \"P\", \"P\", \"P\", \"P\", \"P\", \"P\", \"P\"],\n            [\" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \"],\n            [\" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \"],\n            [\" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \"],\n            [\" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \"],\n            [\"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\"],\n            [\"r\", \"n\", \"b\", \"q\", \"k\", \"b\", \"n\", \"r\"]\n        ]\n        self.turn = \"white\"\n\n    def print_board(self):\n        for row in self.board:\n            print(\" \".join(row))\n        print()\n\n    def move_piece(self, start, end):\n        start_row, start_col = start\n        end_row, end_col = end\n        piece = self.board[start_row][start_col]\n        \n        # Basic move validation\n        if piece == \" \":\n            print(\"No piece at the starting position.\")\n            return False\n        if (self.turn == \"white\" and piece.islower()) or (self.turn == \"black\" and piece.isupper()):\n            print(\"It's not your turn.\")\n            return False\n\n        # Move the piece\n        self.board[end_row][end_col] = piece\n        self.board[start_row][start_col] = \" \"\n\n        # Switch turn\n        self.turn = \"black\" if self.turn == \"white\" else \"white\"\n        return True\n\n    def is_checkmate(self, player):\n        # Simplified placeholder logic for checkmate\n        king = \"k\" if player == \"black\" else \"K\"\n        for row in self.board:\n            if king in row:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def is_stalemate(self, player):\n        # Simplified placeholder logic for stalemate\n        # In real chess, stalemate occurs when a player has no legal moves and is not in check\n        return False\n\n    def check_winner(self):\n        if self.is_checkmate(\"white\"):\n            print(\"Black wins by checkmate!\")\n            return \"black\"\n        if self.is_checkmate(\"black\"):\n            print(\"White wins by checkmate!\")\n            return \"white\"\n        if self.is_stalemate(\"white\") or self.is_stalemate(\"black\"):\n            print(\"The game is a draw by stalemate.\")\n            return \"draw\"\n        return None\n\n# Example usage\ngame = ChessGame()\ngame.print_board()\n\n# Example move: white pawn from e2 to e4\ngame.move_piece((6, 4), (4, 4))\ngame.print_board()\n\n# Example move: black pawn from e7 to e5\ngame.move_piece((1, 4), (3, 4))\ngame.print_board()\n\n# Check for winner\ngame.check_winner()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- The `ChessGame` class sets up a basic chessboard and includes functions for moving pieces.\n- The `move_piece` function checks for basic move validity and switches turns between players.\n- The code includes placeholders for `is_checkmate` and `is_stalemate`, which should be implemented with more sophisticated logic to reflect actual chess rules.\n- The `check_winner` function checks for a winner based on simplified checkmate logic.\n\nThis framework provides a starting point. To build a fully functional chess game, you would need to implement comprehensive rules for each piece's movement, handle special moves like castling and en passant, and develop accurate checkmate and stalemate detection algorithms."
