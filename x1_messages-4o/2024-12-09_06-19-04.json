        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that in Python 3, the `reload` function is no longer a built-in function. In Python 2, `reload` was a built-in function, but in Python 3, it has been moved to the `importlib` module.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to import the `reload` function from the `importlib` module and then use it. Here's how you can do that:\n\n```python\nimport importlib\n\n# Assuming recommendations is your module\nimportlib.reload(recommendations)\n```\n\nMake sure that the module `recommendations` is already imported before you attempt to reload it. If you have not imported it yet, you can do so with:\n\n```python\nimport recommendations\nimport importlib\n\nimportlib.reload(recommendations)\n```\n\nThis should resolve the `NameError` and allow you to reload the module as intended."
