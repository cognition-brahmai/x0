The images are in 24-bit .bmp format and I've already written a reader for this and stored the pixels in an array. However, I'm having difficulty understanding the math behind bilinear interpolation, despite going through resources such as the Wikipedia article. Could someone provide a link to an existing bilinear interpolation algorithm on a 1-D array? Alternatively, a link to an open source image processing library that uses bilinear and bicubic interpolation for scaling images would also be appreciated."

        "content": "Bilinear interpolation is a resampling method used in image processing to estimate new pixel values when scaling images. It is based on linear interpolation and operates in two dimensions, horizontally and vertically. Here's a brief explanation of the math behind it:\n\nSuppose you have a pixel at position \\((x, y)\\) and you want to interpolate its value based on its four nearest neighbors: \\((x0, y0)\\), \\((x1, y0)\\), \\((x0, y1)\\), and \\((x1, y1)\\). The interpolation can be expressed as:\n\n1. First, interpolate in the x-direction:\n   \\[\n   R1 = \\frac{x1 - x}{x1 - x0} \\cdot f(x0, y0) + \\frac{x - x0}{x1 - x0} \\cdot f(x1, y0)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   R2 = \\frac{x1 - x}{x1 - x0} \\cdot f(x0, y1) + \\frac{x - x0}{x1 - x0} \\cdot f(x1, y1)\n   \\]\n\n2. Then interpolate in the y-direction:\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{y1 - y}{y1 - y0} \\cdot R1 + \\frac{y - y0}{y1 - y0} \\cdot R2\n   \\]\n\nWhere \\(f(x, y)\\) represents the pixel value at position \\((x, y)\\).\n\nFor CUDA optimization, you can parallelize this process by assigning each thread to compute the value of a single pixel in the output image.\n\nFor existing implementations, you can take a look at the following resources:\n\n1. **NVIDIA's CUDA Samples** - NVIDIA provides sample code that demonstrates various CUDA techniques, including image processing tasks. You can check their [CUDA Samples GitHub repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples).\n\n2. **OpenCV** - OpenCV is a widely-used open source computer vision library that includes functions for image resizing with bilinear and other interpolation methods. You can explore the [OpenCV GitHub repository](https://github.com/opencv/opencv).\n\n3. **ImageMagick** - This is another powerful image processing library with support for various interpolation methods. Check out the [ImageMagick GitHub repository](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick).\n\nThese libraries can provide you with a reference for implementing bilinear interpolation in your project and may offer optimized implementations that you can study or integrate."
