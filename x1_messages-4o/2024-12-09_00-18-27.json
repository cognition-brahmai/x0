I've noticed that my program doesn't exit when sys.exit() is called in a thread, but does exit when called in the main thread. I'm confused as to why this happens. My current understanding is that the sys.exit() function should terminate the Python program. However, even though \"post thread exit\" is never printed, the main thread continues to run even after the thread has called sys.exit(). \n\nHere is the code snippet I'm referring to:\n\n```python\nimport sys, time\nfrom threading import Thread\n\ndef testexit():\n    time.sleep(5)\n    sys.exit()\n    print \"post thread exit\"\n\nt = Thread(target = testexit)\nt.start()\nt.join()\nprint \"pre main exit, post thread exit\"\nsys.exit()\nprint \"post main exit\"\n```\n\nIs it possible that a separate instance of the Python interpreter is created for each thread, and the call to sys.exit() is just exiting that separate instance? If so, how does the threading implementation manage access to shared resources? Also, what would be the way to exit the program from the thread, if I wanted to do so?"

        "content": "In Python, the `sys.exit()` function raises a `SystemExit` exception, which is intended to exit the program. However, when `sys.exit()` is called within a thread, it only raises the exception in that particular thread and does not terminate the entire process. This is because `sys.exit()` does not directly terminate the process; it just raises an exception that can be caught and handled like any other exception.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what happens in your code:\n\n1. The `testexit()` function is run in a separate thread. When `sys.exit()` is called inside this thread, it raises a `SystemExit` exception for that thread only.\n2. The main thread is not affected by this exception and continues execution.\n3. The `t.join()` call in the main thread waits for the thread `t` to finish execution.\n4. After the thread completes, the main thread proceeds to print \"pre main exit, post thread exit\" and then calls `sys.exit()`, which now causes the entire program to terminate.\n\nTo terminate the entire program from a thread, you can use the `os._exit()` function from the `os` module. This function skips the cleanup and exits immediately, effectively stopping the whole process:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport time\nfrom threading import Thread\n\ndef testexit():\n    time.sleep(5)\n    os._exit(0)  # Immediately terminates the entire program\n\nt = Thread(target=testexit)\nt.start()\nt.join()  # This will not complete because os._exit() will terminate the process\nprint(\"pre main exit, post thread exit\")  # This line will not be executed\n```\n\nUsing `os._exit(0)` will terminate the process without calling cleanup handlers, flushing stdio buffers, etc., so use it cautiously when you are sure that immediate termination is necessary."
