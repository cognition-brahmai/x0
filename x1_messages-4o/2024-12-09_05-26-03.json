However, I'm receiving an error saying `AttributeError: module 'pandas' has no attribute 'scatter_matrix'`. I even tried to update pandas and matplotlib using `conda update pandas` and `conda update matplotlib` commands but the issue still persists. My pandas version is `'0.24.2'`. How can I solve this error?\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load some data\niris = datasets.load_iris()\niris_df = pd.DataFrame(iris['data'], columns=iris['feature_names'])\niris_df['species'] = iris['target']\n\npd.scatter_matrix(iris_df, alpha=0.2, figsize=(10, 10))\nplt.show()\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the `scatter_matrix` function not being a direct attribute of the main pandas module. Instead, it resides in the `pandas.plotting` module. This was a change made in later versions of pandas, and since you're using an older version, this could be causing the confusion.\n\nHere's how you can fix the error by using the `scatter_matrix` function from the `pandas.plotting` module:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom pandas.plotting import scatter_matrix\nfrom sklearn import datasets\n\n# Load some data\niris = datasets.load_iris()\niris_df = pd.DataFrame(iris['data'], columns=iris['feature_names'])\niris_df['species'] = iris['target']\n\n# Use scatter_matrix from pandas.plotting\nscatter_matrix(iris_df, alpha=0.2, figsize=(10, 10), diagonal='kde')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nAlso, consider updating your pandas library to a more recent version if possible, as newer versions may have additional features and improvements. You can upgrade pandas using:\n\n```bash\nconda update pandas\n```\n\nor if using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install --upgrade pandas\n```\n\nLet me know if you need further assistance!"
