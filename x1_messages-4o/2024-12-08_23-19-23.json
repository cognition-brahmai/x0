        "content": "To create a versatile program capable of computing compound interest on a loan with potential fluctuations in interest rates, we can write a Python script. This script will calculate the compound interest for each year, taking into account any changes in interest rates, and generate a report. Here's a basic implementation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_compound_interest(principal, interest_rates, years):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate compound interest with potential fluctuations in interest rates.\n\n    :param principal: Initial amount of money (float)\n    :param interest_rates: List of interest rates for each year (list of floats)\n    :param years: Number of years over which interest is calculated (int)\n    :return: List of tuples containing year, interest for that year, and total amount\n    \"\"\"\n    total_amount = principal\n    report = []\n\n    for year in range(1, years + 1):\n        rate = interest_rates[year - 1]\n        interest_for_year = total_amount * rate / 100\n        total_amount += interest_for_year\n        report.append((year, round(interest_for_year, 2), round(total_amount, 2)))\n\n    return report\n\ndef generate_report(principal, interest_rates, years):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generate a detailed report of compound interest calculation.\n\n    :param principal: Initial amount of money (float)\n    :param interest_rates: List of interest rates for each year (list of floats)\n    :param years: Number of years over which interest is calculated (int)\n    \"\"\"\n    report = calculate_compound_interest(principal, interest_rates, years)\n    print(f\"Principal: ${principal}\")\n    print(\"Year | Interest Earned | Total Amount\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------\")\n    for year, interest, total in report:\n        print(f\"{year}    | ${interest}         | ${total}\")\n\n# Example usage\nprincipal_amount = 10000\ninterest_rates = [5, 4.5, 5.5, 6]  # Example interest rates for each year\nnumber_of_years = len(interest_rates)\n\ngenerate_report(principal_amount, interest_rates, number_of_years)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Principal**: The initial amount of the loan ($10,000).\n- **Interest Rates**: A list of annual interest rates. Each rate corresponds to a specific year.\n- **Years**: The duration over which the interest is computed.\n- **calculate_compound_interest**: A function that computes the compound interest for each year, taking into account the changing interest rates.\n- **generate_report**: A function that generates and prints a detailed yearly report of the interest earned and the total amount.\n\n### Customization:\n- You can adjust the `interest_rates` list to reflect the actual or expected rates for each year.\n- The program assumes the rates list length matches the number of years. Adjust accordingly if needed.\n\nThis script provides a clear view of how the loan amount grows over time with varying interest rates, highlighting the interest earned each year."
