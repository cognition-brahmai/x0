        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the way you're passing the `nn_model` function to `KerasRegressor`. The `KerasRegressor` expects a function that returns a compiled Keras model, but currently you're passing the model object itself, which is causing the TypeError.\n\nHere's how you can fix the issue:\n\n1. Pass the `nn_model` function directly to the `KerasRegressor` as `build_fn`, instead of passing the model object.\n\n2. Additionally, there are a couple of updates you might need to make, since some of the functions and methods you're using are deprecated in newer versions of the libraries. However, based on your environment details, I'll focus on the error you're currently facing.\n\nHere's the corrected part of your code:\n\n```python\nfrom keras.wrappers.scikit_learn import KerasRegressor\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score, KFold\n\ndef nn_model():\n    \"create a model.\"\n    model = Sequential()\n    model.add(Dense(output_dim=100, input_dim=105, activation='softplus'))\n    model.add(Dense(output_dim=1, activation='softplus'))\n    model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam')\n    return model\n\ndata = read_db()\ny = data.pop('PRICE').values  # as_matrix() is now replaced with .values\nx = data.values\n\n# Pass the nn_model function to KerasRegressor\nmodel = KerasRegressor(build_fn=nn_model, nb_epoch=2)\n\n# Fit the model\nmodel.fit(x, y)\n```\n\n### Additional Suggestions:\n\n- Consider updating your Python and library versions if possible, as Python 3.5 is no longer supported and newer versions of Keras and scikit-learn have significant improvements.\n  \n- The `as_matrix()` method has been deprecated in newer versions of pandas. Using `.values` is a more current approach.\n\n- The `KFold` and other cross-validation tools should be imported from `sklearn.model_selection` in newer versions of scikit-learn.\n\n- Always ensure that the input and output dimensions in your model match those of the data you are working with. \n\nThese changes should resolve the error you are encountering and allow you to proceed with using the scikit-learn API for further tasks like grid search."
