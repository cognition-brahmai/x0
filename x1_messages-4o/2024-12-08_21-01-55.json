        "content": "Certainly! Below is a hierarchical JSON data structure that includes three keys with unique, non-redundant values, each corresponding to a different data type. The structure is two levels deep and demonstrates intricate relationships and interdependencies between the values.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"library\": {\n    \"name\": \"Central City Library\",\n    \"location\": {\n      \"address\": \"123 Library Lane\",\n      \"city\": \"Metropolis\",\n      \"state\": \"Confederation\"\n    },\n    \"books\": [\n      {\n        \"title\": \"Exploring Quantum Physics\",\n        \"author\": \"Dr. Jane Doe\",\n        \"ISBN\": \"978-3-16-148410-0\",\n        \"availability\": {\n          \"total_copies\": 5,\n          \"borrowed\": 2\n        },\n        \"genres\": [\"Science\", \"Physics\"]\n      },\n      {\n        \"title\": \"The Art of Culinary\",\n        \"author\": \"Chef John Smith\",\n        \"ISBN\": \"978-1-86197-876-9\",\n        \"availability\": {\n          \"total_copies\": 3,\n          \"borrowed\": 1\n        },\n        \"genres\": [\"Cooking\", \"Art\"]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"members\": [\n      {\n        \"member_id\": 101,\n        \"name\": \"Alice Johnson\",\n        \"borrowed_books\": [\n          {\n            \"ISBN\": \"978-3-16-148410-0\",\n            \"borrow_date\": \"2023-10-01\"\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"member_id\": 102,\n        \"name\": \"Bob Williams\",\n        \"borrowed_books\": [\n          {\n            \"ISBN\": \"978-1-86197-876-9\",\n            \"borrow_date\": \"2023-10-05\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"ISBN\": \"978-3-16-148410-0\",\n            \"borrow_date\": \"2023-10-03\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Intricacies and Interdependencies:\n\n1. **String Data Type - Library Details**:\n   - The `library` object contains basic details like `name` (a string), which identifies the library. The `location` is another nested object providing more detailed information about the library's physical presence, such as `address`, `city`, and `state`.\n\n2. **Array Data Type - Books and Members**:\n   - `books` is an array of objects, where each object represents a book available in the library. Each book has attributes such as `title`, `author`, `ISBN`, and `availability`.\n   - `members` is another array of objects, representing individuals who are registered with the library. Each member has a `member_id`, `name`, and an array of `borrowed_books`.\n\n3. **Object Data Type - Availability and Borrowed Books**:\n   - The `availability` object within each book provides details about how many copies are total and how many are currently borrowed, thus affecting the decision-making process on whether a book can be borrowed by another member.\n   - The `borrowed_books` array inside each member object contains objects that reference books by `ISBN`, indicating which books a member has borrowed and when, establishing a direct link between members and books.\n\n4. **Cross-References**:\n   - The `ISBN` field acts as a unique identifier that links the `books` array with the `borrowed_books` array in the `members` section, ensuring consistency and integrity of references. This allows tracking of which books are borrowed by which members and when.\n   - The `borrow_date` in the `borrowed_books` array provides a timeline, enabling the library to manage borrowing periods, due dates, and potential late fees.\n\nThis JSON structure represents a small library system where books and members are intricately linked through borrowing records, ensuring complex data management and retrieval possibilities."
