        "content": "In Python, the most common and conventional way to make your package available for import without modifying `PYTHONPATH` or `sys.path` is to install it using a package management tool like `pip`. This approach will automatically place your package in the appropriate `site-packages` directory for your Python environment.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Organize Your Package:**\n   Ensure your package is organized with a proper directory structure and includes a `setup.py` file. For example:\n\n   ```\n   mypackage/\n       mypackage/\n           __init__.py\n           module1.py\n           module2.py\n       setup.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a `setup.py`:**\n   The `setup.py` file should contain metadata about your package and instructions for installation. A basic example would look like this:\n\n   ```python\n   from setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\n   setup(\n       name='mypackage',\n       version='0.1',\n       packages=find_packages(),\n       install_requires=[\n           # List your package dependencies here\n       ],\n   )\n   ```\n\n3. **Install the Package:**\n   Use `pip` to install your package locally. This will place it in the appropriate `site-packages` directory:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install .\n   ```\n\n   Run this command from the directory containing your `setup.py` file.\n\nUsing this method, your package will be installed in the `site-packages` directory, making it available for import without any additional path modifications. It is generally not recommended to manually copy and paste your package into the `site-packages` directory, as this can lead to maintenance issues and conflicts with package management tools.\n\nBy following these steps, you ensure that your package is installed in a clean and manageable way, adhering to Python's best practices for package distribution and installation."
