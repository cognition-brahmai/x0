Would you use a switch statement or an if-else statement to choose between the landscape photo, bird portrait, city skyline, or sunrise photo? How would you ensure that each photo has an equal chance of being displayed? \nHere are the photo options:\n- Landscape photo of a mountain and valley\n- Serene portrait of a bird in flight over a lake\n- Vibrant city skyline\n- Breathtaking photo of a sunrise over the horizon\n[C++ code]\n```c++\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cstdlib>\n#include <ctime>\nusing namespace std;\nint main() {\n    srand(time(NULL)); // seed random number generator with current time\n    int photoChoice = rand() % 4; // choose a random number between 0 and 3\n    // use switch statement to display corresponding photo based on random number\n    switch (photoChoice) {\n        case 0:\n            cout << \"Displaying landscape photo of a mountain and valley\" << endl;\n            break;\n        case 1:\n            cout << \"Displaying serene portrait of a bird in flight over a lake\" << endl;\n            break;\n        case 2:\n            cout << \"Displaying vibrant city skyline\" << endl;\n            break;\n        case 3:\n            cout << \"Displaying breathtaking photo of a sunrise over the horizon\" << endl;\n            break;\n        default:\n            cout << \"Error: Invalid photo choice\" << endl;\n            break;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```"

        "content": "To create a program that randomly displays one of four photos in C++, using a switch statement is a suitable approach. You've already set up a good framework for this task. In your code snippet, you utilize `srand(time(NULL))` to seed the random number generator with the current time, ensuring that `rand()` produces different sequences of random numbers each time the program runs.\n\nThe `rand() % 4` expression generates a random integer between 0 and 3, giving each photo an equal probability of being selected. The switch statement then uses this integer to determine which photo description to display.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what you've done correctly and how it ensures equal chances for each photo:\n\n1. **Random Seed Initialization:**\n   - `srand(time(NULL));` initializes the random number generator with the current time, which is a common practice to ensure that the sequence of random numbers varies with each execution.\n\n2. **Random Number Generation:**\n   - `int photoChoice = rand() % 4;` generates a random number between 0 and 3. The modulo operation restricts the range of possible values, providing an equal probability of 25% for each outcome.\n\n3. **Switch Statement:**\n   - The switch statement efficiently maps each random value to a specific case, displaying the corresponding photo description. This approach is concise and clear for handling multiple discrete options.\n\nYour implementation is well-structured for the given task. However, you could also achieve the same functionality using if-else statements, but a switch statement is more readable and efficient when dealing with fixed integer constants like this.\n\nHere's how you might implement the same logic using if-else statements:\n\n```c++\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cstdlib>\n#include <ctime>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    srand(time(NULL)); // Seed random number generator with current time\n    int photoChoice = rand() % 4; // Choose a random number between 0 and 3\n\n    // Use if-else statements to display corresponding photo based on random number\n    if (photoChoice == 0) {\n        cout << \"Displaying landscape photo of a mountain and valley\" << endl;\n    } else if (photoChoice == 1) {\n        cout << \"Displaying serene portrait of a bird in flight over a lake\" << endl;\n    } else if (photoChoice == 2) {\n        cout << \"Displaying vibrant city skyline\" << endl;\n    } else if (photoChoice == 3) {\n        cout << \"Displaying breathtaking photo of a sunrise over the horizon\" << endl;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"Error: Invalid photo choice\" << endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nBoth implementations will work correctly, but the switch statement is generally preferred for readability when dealing with multiple fixed cases."
