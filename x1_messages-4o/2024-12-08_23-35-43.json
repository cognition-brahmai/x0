        "content": "To generate a SQL query that identifies African countries where the country's population is greater than the population of their respective capital city, you'll need to ensure your database has the correct structure. Based on your description, it seems like you may have two separate tables for countries and capitals, or a single table where capital populations are also stored. I'll assume you have a single table for simplicity, and the capital population is stored in another column called `Capital_Population`. Here's how you could structure your query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT Country\nFROM africa_countries\nWHERE Population > Capital_Population;\n```\n\nIf you have separate tables for countries and capitals, you would need to join them. Here\u2019s an outline of how that query might look, assuming you have a `capitals` table with `Capital`, `Country`, and `Capital_Population` columns:\n\n```sql\nSELECT a.Country\nFROM africa_countries a\nJOIN capitals c ON a.Country = c.Country\nWHERE a.Population > c.Capital_Population;\n```\n\nMake sure to adjust the column names and table relations as per your actual database schema."
