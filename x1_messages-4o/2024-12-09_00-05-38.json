Assuming that the words \"flies,\" \"woman,\" \"an,\" \"the,\" and \"old\" are in cells A1 to A5 respectively, here's how you can do it:\n\n1. In a new cell, use the `CONCATENATE` function or the `&` operator to combine the words. The `CONCATENATE` function or `&` operator will allow you to join text from different cells into one cell.\n\n2. Assuming the words are in the following cells:\n   - \"the\" is in A4\n   - \"old\" is in A5\n   - \"woman\" is in A2\n   - \"flies\" is in A1\n   - \"an\" is in A3\n\nHere's the formula you would use to form the sentence \"The old woman flies an\":\n\n```excel\n=A4 & \" \" & A5 & \" \" & A2 & \" \" & A1 & \" \" & A3\n```\n\nThis formula concatenates the words in the order needed and adds spaces between them to form the correct sentence."
