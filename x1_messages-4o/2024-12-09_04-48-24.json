I need to run both these tasks using infinite while loops without exiting from any of them. I have considered threading, but I am aware of the GIL. How do I get both these loops to execute simultaneously? Here's the code I have:\n\n```python\nfrom multiprocessing import Process\n\ndef methodA():\n    while TRUE:\n        # do something\n\ndef methodB():\n    while TRUE:\n        # do something\n\np=Process(target=methodA())\np.start()\np1=Process(target=methodB())\np1.start()\n```\n\nWhen I start the process `p`, it starts executing, but how do I get the process `p1` to run simultaneously?"

        "content": "To run both tasks simultaneously using infinite loops, your approach to use the `multiprocessing` module is correct. However, there is a small mistake in the way you are starting the processes. When you pass the target function to the `Process` constructor, you should not call the function (i.e., omit the parentheses `()`), but rather pass the function object itself. Here\u2019s how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nfrom multiprocessing import Process\n\ndef methodA():\n    while True:\n        # Sensor reading, plotting, and logging code here\n        pass\n\ndef methodB():\n    while True:\n        # IP Camera input and video storing code here\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Create the processes\n    p = Process(target=methodA)\n    p1 = Process(target=methodB)\n\n    # Start the processes\n    p.start()\n    p1.start()\n\n    # Optionally, join the processes if you want the main program to wait for them to complete\n    p.join()\n    p1.join()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n1. **`Process` Target**: Use `target=methodA` instead of `target=methodA()`. This ensures that the function itself is passed, not its result.\n\n2. **`if __name__ == '__main__'`:** This is necessary to ensure that the code runs correctly on Windows and other platforms that require the protection of the entry point for multiprocessing.\n\n3. **Joining Processes**: Using `p.join()` and `p1.join()` will block the main program from exiting until both processes finish, which is useful if you want the main program to wait for the subprocesses to complete before exiting.\n\n4. **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**: The GIL does not affect the `multiprocessing` module as each process runs in its own Python interpreter with its own GIL, allowing true parallelism on multi-core systems.\n\nBy following these adjustments, both `methodA` and `methodB` will run concurrently in separate processes."
