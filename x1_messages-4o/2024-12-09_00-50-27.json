Can you explain what '@reify' does and when it should be used? Here's the sample code where I saw its usage:\n\n```python\ndef __init__(self, request):\n    self.request = request\n    renderer = get_renderer(\"templates/global_layout.pt\")\n    self.global_template = renderer.implementation().macros['layout']\n\n@reify\ndef company_name(self):\n    return COMPANY\n\n@reify\ndef site_menu(self):\n    new_menu = SITE_MENU[:]\n    url = self.request.url\n    for menu in new_menu:\n        if menu['title'] == 'Home':\n            menu['current'] = url.endswith('/')\n        else:\n            menu['current'] = url.endswith(menu['href'])\n    return new_menu\n\n@view_config(renderer=\"templates/index.pt\")\ndef index_view(self):\n    return {\"page_title\": \"Home\"}\n\n@view_config(renderer=\"templates/about.pt\", name=\"about.html\")\ndef about_view(self):\n    return {\"page_title\": \"About\"}\n```"

        "content": "The `@reify` decorator in Python, specifically in the Pyramid web framework, is used to create a property that is computed once and then cached for the lifetime of the instance. This means that the first time you access the property, the function decorated with `@reify` is called, and its result is stored. Subsequent accesses to the property will return the cached result, rather than recomputing it.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what `@reify` does and when it might be useful:\n\n### Functionality:\n1. **Lazy Evaluation**: The function is not executed until the property is accessed for the first time. This can improve performance, especially if the computation is expensive and might not always be needed.\n   \n2. **Caching**: Once the function is called and the result is computed, the result is stored. Future accesses to the property return this stored value, avoiding unnecessary recomputation.\n\n### When to Use `@reify`:\n- **Expensive Calculations**: If the property involves a computation that is resource-intensive or time-consuming, and you expect to use this value multiple times during the instance's lifecycle, `@reify` is beneficial.\n  \n- **Request-Specific Data**: In the context of web applications, it can be useful for request-specific data that should only be computed once per request.\n\n- **Immutable After Computation**: When the property value doesn\u2019t change after it is initially computed, making caching feasible and beneficial.\n\n### Example Explanation:\nIn your sample code:\n\n- **`company_name` Property**: The `@reify` decorator is used for the `company_name` property, which is a simple static value (`COMPANY`). While this example doesn\u2019t benefit much from `@reify` due to its simplicity, it demonstrates the use of `@reify` for consistency across potentially more complex properties.\n\n- **`site_menu` Property**: This property is more complex as it creates a new menu structure based on the current request URL. Using `@reify` here ensures that this computation happens only once per request, which can be beneficial if `site_menu` is accessed multiple times within the request handling.\n\nBy caching the result of these computations, `@reify` helps optimize performance by reducing redundant calculations and ensuring consistency in the data returned throughout the request's lifecycle."
