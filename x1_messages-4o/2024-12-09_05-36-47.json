However, I am encountering a problem when trying to fit the model. The error message I receive is `ValueError: Layer sequential_20 expects 1 inputs, but it received 2 input tensors.` I am new to TensorFlow and I'm not understanding this error, especially as it seems to involve aspects not present in my code. Could anyone help me understand and resolve this issue? Here is the full code I am using:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras\nimport tensorflow_datasets as tfds\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n(img_train, label_train), (img_test, label_test) = tfds.as_numpy(tfds.load(\n    name = 'kmnist',\n    split=['train', 'test'],\n    batch_size=-1,\n    as_supervised=True,\n))\n\nimg_train = img_train.squeeze()\nimg_test = img_test.squeeze()\n\nstacked_encoder = keras.models.Sequential([\n    keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=[28, 28]),\n    keras.layers.Dense(100, activation=\"selu\"),\n    keras.layers.Dense(30, activation=\"selu\"),\n])\n\nstacked_decoder = keras.models.Sequential([\n    keras.layers.Dense(100, activation=\"selu\", input_shape=[30]),\n    keras.layers.Dense(28 * 28, activation=\"sigmoid\"),\n    keras.layers.Reshape([28, 28])\n])\n\nstacked_ae = keras.models.Sequential([stacked_encoder, stacked_decoder])\nstacked_ae.compile(loss=\"binary_crossentropy\",\n                   optimizer=keras.optimizers.SGD(lr=1.5))\n\nhistory = stacked_ae.fit(img_train, img_train, epochs=10,\n                         validation_data=[img_test, img_test])\n```"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering, `ValueError: Layer sequential_20 expects 1 inputs, but it received 2 input tensors.`, typically arises when the model is expecting a single input but is inadvertently receiving multiple inputs. In your case, this might be due to the way you are providing the `validation_data`.\n\n### Things to Check and Fix:\n\n1. **Validation Data Format**:\n   Make sure the `validation_data` parameter is passed as a tuple. In your code, you have:\n   ```python\n   validation_data=[img_test, img_test]\n   ```\n   Change this to:\n   ```python\n   validation_data=(img_test, img_test)\n   ```\n   This way, you're specifying the validation data as a tuple with inputs and targets.\n\n2. **Learning Rate**:\n   While it's not related to the error, just a heads-up for better training results. The learning rate `lr=1.5` is quite high and may lead to unstable training. Consider starting with a smaller learning rate like `lr=0.01`.\n\n3. **Loss Function**:\n   You're using `binary_crossentropy` as the loss function, which is suitable if your input data is normalized between 0 and 1. Ensure that your KMNIST data is scaled appropriately:\n   ```python\n   img_train = img_train.astype('float32') / 255.0\n   img_test = img_test.astype('float32') / 255.0\n   ```\n\nHere is your corrected code snippet with the changes applied:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras\nimport tensorflow_datasets as tfds\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n(img_train, label_train), (img_test, label_test) = tfds.as_numpy(tfds.load(\n    name='kmnist',\n    split=['train', 'test'],\n    batch_size=-1,\n    as_supervised=True,\n))\n\nimg_train = img_train.squeeze().astype('float32') / 255.0\nimg_test = img_test.squeeze().astype('float32') / 255.0\n\nstacked_encoder = keras.models.Sequential([\n    keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=[28, 28]),\n    keras.layers.Dense(100, activation=\"selu\"),\n    keras.layers.Dense(30, activation=\"selu\"),\n])\n\nstacked_decoder = keras.models.Sequential([\n    keras.layers.Dense(100, activation=\"selu\", input_shape=[30]),\n    keras.layers.Dense(28 * 28, activation=\"sigmoid\"),\n    keras.layers.Reshape([28, 28])\n])\n\nstacked_ae = keras.models.Sequential([stacked_encoder, stacked_decoder])\nstacked_ae.compile(loss=\"binary_crossentropy\",\n                   optimizer=keras.optimizers.SGD(lr=0.01))\n\nhistory = stacked_ae.fit(img_train, img_train, epochs=10,\n                         validation_data=(img_test, img_test))\n```\n\nThis should resolve the error you encountered.
