However, when I try to execute, I encounter an error which states: \"AttributeError: module 'sys' has no attribute 'maxint'\". The code and error stack trace are as follows:\n\nCode:\n```python\nimport sys\nprint(sys.maxint)\n```\nError:\n```python\nD:\\Python3.7\\python.exe \"D:/PyCharm 2017.2.3/Workplace/maximizer.py\"\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"D:/PyCharm 2017.2.3/Workplace/maximizer.py\", line 2, in <module>\n    print(sys.maxint)\nAttributeError: module 'sys' has no attribute 'maxint'\n```\nHow can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is because the `sys.maxint` attribute does not exist in Python 3. In Python 2, `sys.maxint` was used to define the maximum integer value, but in Python 3, integers can be arbitrarily large and are limited only by available memory. Therefore, `sys.maxint` has been removed.\n\nIf you want to get the maximum value for an integer type in a particular context (e.g., for a C-like 64-bit integer), you can use `sys.maxsize`, which gives you the maximum size lists, strings, dicts, and many other containers can have. Typically, `sys.maxsize` is `2**63 - 1` on a 64-bit platform.\n\nHere's how you can adjust your code:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nprint(sys.maxsize)\n```\n\nThis will give you the maximum \"practical\" integer value that is relevant for the Python interpreter's internal use and operations. However, for most practical purposes, you can use integers larger than this in Python 3 without any issues."
