When I try to use pip to install packages, I receive an error message that indicates: AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'loader'. The error seems to be related to processing line 3 of /home/cjones/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/googleapis_common_protos-1.5.8-py3.6-nspkg.pth. The rest of the error includes a traceback, which I have pasted below:\n\n```\nError processing line 3 of /home/cjones/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/googleapis_common_protos-1.5.8-py3.6-nspkg.pth:\n\n  Traceback (most recent call last):\n    File \"/usr/lib/python3.6/site.py\", line 174, in addpackage\n      exec(line)\n    File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\n    File \"<frozen importlib._bootstrap>\", line 568, in module_from_spec\n  AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'loader'\n\nRemainder of file ignored\n```\n\nI don't believe I've made any changes since the last successful boot. It seems as though something is missing. Can anyone provide assistance?"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering indicates that there is an issue with a `.pth` file related to the `googleapis_common_protos` package. A `.pth` file is typically used to add additional directories to the Python path or to execute some initialization code. The error suggests that there is a problem with the execution of the code in this file.\n\nHere's how you can try to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Backup and Inspect the .pth File:**\n   - First, make a backup of the problematic `.pth` file. You can do this by renaming the file:\n     ```bash\n     mv /home/cjones/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/googleapis_common_protos-1.5.8-py3.6-nspkg.pth /home/cjones/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/googleapis_common_protos-1.5.8-py3.6-nspkg.pth.bak\n     ```\n   - Open the file in a text editor to inspect its contents. Check if there's any code that looks like it could be causing issues.\n\n2. **Reinstall the Package:**\n   - Try reinstalling the `googleapis_common_protos` package to see if that resolves the issue:\n     ```bash\n     pip uninstall googleapis-common-protos\n     pip install googleapis-common-protos\n     ```\n\n3. **Check for Package Dependencies:**\n   - Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and up-to-date. Sometimes, updating pip and setuptools can help:\n     ```bash\n     pip install --upgrade pip setuptools\n     ```\n\n4. **Verify Python Environment:**\n   - Ensure that your Python environment is not corrupted. You might want to consider setting up a virtual environment to isolate your Python packages:\n     ```bash\n     python3 -m venv myenv\n     source myenv/bin/activate\n     ```\n\n5. **Check for Conflicts:**\n   - Sometimes there can be conflicting packages. Check if there are any other versions of the `googleapis_common_protos` package or related packages installed that might be causing a conflict.\n\n6. **Consult Logs and Documentation:**\n   - Check if there are any logs or additional documentation from the package that might provide more insight into the issue.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues, you might want to look for similar issues or report the problem on the package's issue tracker."
