Can anyone help me improve this? Here is my current function:\n\n```python\ndef rot13(s):\n    chars = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n    trans = chars[13:]+chars[:13]\n    rot_char = lambda c: trans[chars.find(c)] if chars.find(c)>-1 else c\n    return ''.join( rot_char(c) for c in s ) \n```"

        "content": "Certainly! Your current implementation works for lowercase characters, but we can extend it to handle uppercase letters as well. To achieve this, we can create separate transformation strings for uppercase and lowercase letters and modify the `rot_char` function to handle both cases.\n\nHere's an improved version of your `rot13` function:\n\n```python\ndef rot13(s):\n    lower_chars = \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n    upper_chars = \"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"\n    lower_trans = lower_chars[13:] + lower_chars[:13]\n    upper_trans = upper_chars[13:] + upper_chars[:13]\n\n    def rot_char(c):\n        if c in lower_chars:\n            return lower_trans[lower_chars.find(c)]\n        elif c in upper_chars:\n            return upper_trans[upper_chars.find(c)]\n        else:\n            return c\n\n    return ''.join(rot_char(c) for c in s)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(rot13(\"Hello, World!\"))  # Outputs: Uryyb, Jbeyq!\n```\n\nThis function now correctly handles both uppercase and lowercase characters, applying the ROT13 transformation to each appropriately. Characters that are not alphabetic remain unchanged."
