To make a cup of coffee with a twist, you must solve the following puzzle to ensure that the water temperature is maintained within the optimal range of 195\u00b0F to 205\u00b0F. Here are your puzzle clues:\n- If you add 2 and 2, you should \"boil\" the water.\n- If you subtract 3 from 6, you should \"heat\" the water.\n- If you multiply 4 by 3, you should \"pour\" the water.\n- If you divide 9 by 3, you should \"brew\" the coffee.\nUsing these clues, can you determine the correct sequence of steps to make a delicious cup of coffee while keeping the water temperature within the desired range? Make sure to input your answers using the solution words provided in the puzzle table. Best of luck!"

        "content": "To solve this puzzle and determine the correct sequence of steps for making a delicious cup of coffee, we can interpret the clues as follows:\n\n1. **Add 2 and 2**: This equals 4, which corresponds to the action \"boil\" the water. Boiling water typically reaches 212\u00b0F, which is above the desired range, so we'll need to manage the temperature after boiling.\n\n2. **Subtract 3 from 6**: This equals 3, which corresponds to the action \"heat\" the water. Heating the water implies bringing it to the optimal temperature range of 195\u00b0F to 205\u00b0F if it\u2019s not already there.\n\n3. **Multiply 4 by 3**: This equals 12, which corresponds to the action \"pour\" the water. Pouring should happen when the water is within the optimal temperature range.\n\n4. **Divide 9 by 3**: This equals 3, which corresponds to the action \"brew\" the coffee. Brewing is the final step that should be done with water in the optimal temperature range.\n\nBased on these interpretations, the correct sequence of steps would be:\n\n1. **Boil** the water: Get the water to a boil, knowing that it will likely exceed the optimal range.\n2. **Heat** the water: Allow the water to cool slightly or adjust the heat to bring it into the desired range of 195\u00b0F to 205\u00b0F.\n3. **Pour** the water: Once the water is at the optimal temperature, pour it over the coffee grounds.\n4. **Brew** the coffee: Allow the coffee to steep and extract the flavors with the water at the ideal temperature.\n\nBy following this sequence, you'll ensure that your coffee is brewed with water at the right temperature, enhancing the flavor and quality of your cup. Enjoy your coffee!"
