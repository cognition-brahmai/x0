        "content": "To generate a SQL statement that displays the top 3 highest-paid employees in a company, you can use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the employees by their salary in descending order, and then use the `LIMIT` clause to restrict the results to the top 3 entries. Here's an example SQL query assuming you have a table named `employees` with columns `employee_id`, `employee_name`, and `salary`:\n\n```sql\nSELECT employee_id, employee_name, salary\nFROM employees\nORDER BY salary DESC\nLIMIT 3;\n```\n\nThis query selects the `employee_id`, `employee_name`, and `salary` columns from the `employees` table, orders the results by the `salary` column in descending order, and limits the output to the top 3 rows, which correspond to the highest-paid employees. Adjust the column and table names as necessary to fit your specific database schema."
