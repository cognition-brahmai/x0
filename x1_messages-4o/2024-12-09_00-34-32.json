        "content": "To create a PDF file from multiple images in Python, you can use several libraries that simplify this process. Here are a few methods you can consider:\n\n### Method 1: Using `Pillow` and `reportlab`\n\n1. **Pillow**: A Python Imaging Library that adds image processing capabilities.\n2. **reportlab**: A library that allows you to create PDFs.\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom reportlab.pdfgen import canvas\n\ndef images_to_pdf(image_paths, output_path):\n    # Create a PDF file to write to\n    c = canvas.Canvas(output_path)\n    \n    for img_path in image_paths:\n        # Open the image with Pillow\n        image = Image.open(img_path)\n        \n        # Get image dimensions\n        width, height = image.size\n        \n        # Add the image to the PDF\n        c.setPageSize((width, height))\n        c.drawImage(img_path, 0, 0, width=width, height=height)\n        c.showPage()  # End the page\n    \n    # Save the PDF file\n    c.save()\n\n# Example usage\nimage_files = ['image1.jpg', 'image2.png', 'image3.bmp']\noutput_pdf = 'output.pdf'\nimages_to_pdf(image_files, output_pdf)\n```\n\n### Method 2: Using `img2pdf`\n\n`img2pdf` is a simple and efficient library specifically designed for converting images to PDF.\n\n```python\nimport img2pdf\n\ndef convert_images_to_pdf(image_paths, output_path):\n    with open(output_path, \"wb\") as f:\n        f.write(img2pdf.convert(image_paths))\n\n# Example usage\nimage_files = ['image1.jpg', 'image2.png', 'image3.bmp']\noutput_pdf = 'output.pdf'\nconvert_images_to_pdf(image_files, output_pdf)\n```\n\n### Method 3: Using `fpdf2`\n\n`fpdf2` is another library that allows for PDF creation and manipulation.\n\n```python\nfrom fpdf import FPDF\n\ndef images_to_pdf_fpdf(image_paths, output_path):\n    pdf = FPDF()\n    \n    for img_path in image_paths:\n        pdf.add_page()\n        \n        # Assuming all images are the same size, calculate image dimensions\n        # You might need to adjust this depending on the actual dimensions\n        pdf.image(img_path, x=0, y=0, w=210, h=297)  # A4 size dimensions\n    \n    # Save the PDF to file\n    pdf.output(output_path)\n\n# Example usage\nimage_files = ['image1.jpg', 'image2.png', 'image3.bmp']\noutput_pdf = 'output.pdf'\nimages_to_pdf_fpdf(image_files, output_pdf)\n```\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\n- **Installation**: Make sure to install these libraries if they're not already available in your environment:\n  ```bash\n  pip install Pillow reportlab img2pdf fpdf2\n  ```\n- **Image Formats**: Ensure the images are in a supported format (e.g., JPEG, PNG, BMP) and are accessible from your script.\n- **Output Formats**: The examples focus on PDF; however, you can further convert PDF to EPS or PS using external tools like `ghostscript`.\n\nThese methods should cover your needs for converting images to a PDF file in Python."
