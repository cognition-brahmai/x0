This can be done in a single command line statement.\n\nHere is the code to do this:\n\n```bash\necho -e \"apple\\nbanana\\norange\\ncherry\" | sort\n```\n\nWhen you run this command in the terminal, it will output the sorted list:\n\n```\napple\nbanana\ncherry\norange\n```\n\nFor the additional challenge of using only the command line interface without using any text editors, the above command already fulfills that requirement. You directly use `echo` to create the list and `sort` to arrange it alphabetically, all in one line."
