        "content": "How can I efficiently access dictionary items by position in Python 3.6+? I understand that dictionaries are insertion ordered in Python 3.6+ as an implementation detail and official in 3.7+. Given they are ordered, it seems strange that no methods exist to retrieve the i-th item of a dictionary by insertion order. The only solutions available appear to have O(n) complexity: converting to a list via an O(n) process and then using `list.__getitem__`, or enumerating dictionary items in a loop and returning the value when the desired index is reached. Both methods have O(n) time complexity. Given that getting an item from a list has O(1) complexity, is there a way to achieve the same complexity with dictionaries? I am open to solutions using either regular `dict` or `collections.OrderedDict`. If it's not possible, is there a structural reason preventing such a method, or is this just a feature which has not yet been considered or implemented?"

        "content": "In Python, dictionaries are designed primarily for fast look-up by key rather than by position, and this is why there isn't a built-in method to access items by their insertion order with O(1) complexity. While dictionaries maintain insertion order from Python 3.7 onwards, the internal data structure doesn't support efficient index-based access. This is because dictionaries are optimized for key-based access, which is inherently O(1) due to their hash table implementation.\n\nTo access dictionary items by their insertion order with O(n) complexity, you typically use one of the following methods:\n\n1. **Convert to a List**: Convert the dictionary items to a list and access by index.\n   ```python\n   my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n   item = list(my_dict.items())[i]  # Replace `i` with the desired index\n   ```\n\n2. **Iterate through Items**: Use `enumerate` to iterate through the dictionary and stop at the desired index.\n   ```python\n   def get_item_by_index(d, index):\n       for i, item in enumerate(d.items()):\n           if i == index:\n               return item\n       raise IndexError(\"Index out of range\")\n\n   item = get_item_by_index(my_dict, i)  # Replace `i` with the desired index\n   ```\n\nThe structural reason for the lack of O(1) positional access is tied to the dictionary's design, which prioritizes key-value pair efficiency over positional efficiency. Implementing O(1) access by position would require a fundamentally different data structure, possibly compromising the dictionary's hash-based performance.\n\nIf you require frequent access by position, consider maintaining a separate list of keys alongside your dictionary. This way, you can use the list for O(1) index-based access and the dictionary for O(1) key-based access.\n\n```python\nkeys = list(my_dict.keys())\n# Access by position\nkey_at_index = keys[i]\nvalue_at_index = my_dict[key_at_index]\n```\n\nThis dual-structure approach gives you the benefits of both worlds: fast key-based dictionary look-ups and position-based access using the list."
