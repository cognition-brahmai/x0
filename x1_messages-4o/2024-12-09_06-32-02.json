I know there is extensive documentation on how to use matplotlib to get graphs inline in IPython notebook, but GenomeDiagram uses the ReportLab toolkit which I don't think is supported for inline graphing in IPython. I have considered writing out the plot/genome diagram to a file and then open the image inline, like this: \n```python\ngd_diagram.write(\"test.png\", \"PNG\")\ndisplay(file=\"test.png\")\n```\nHowever, I don't know how to do this or even if it's possible. Can anyone assist me on if and how images can be opened or displayed in IPython?"

        "content": "To display an image from a file in a Jupyter Notebook, you can indeed write your genome diagram to a file and then display it using IPython's `Image` class from the `IPython.display` module. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. First, ensure you've saved your diagram using the `write` method from GenomeDiagram.\n2. Then, use the `Image` class to display the saved image file in your Jupyter Notebook.\n\nHere's a step-by-step example:\n\n```python\nfrom IPython.display import Image, display\nfrom Bio.Graphics import GenomeDiagram\nfrom Bio import SeqIO\n\n# Assuming you have created a GenomeDiagram object called gd_diagram:\n# gd_diagram.write(\"test.png\", \"PNG\")\n\n# Now, display the image\ndisplay(Image(filename=\"test.png\"))\n```\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of what the code does:\n\n- `gd_diagram.write(\"test.png\", \"PNG\")`: This line writes your genome diagram to a file named \"test.png\" in PNG format.\n  \n- `Image(filename=\"test.png\")`: This creates an `Image` object for the file \"test.png\".\n  \n- `display(...)`: This function from IPython displays the image inline in the Jupyter Notebook.\n\nThis method allows you to visualize the image output generated by the GenomeDiagram module inline within your Jupyter Notebook. Make sure the image file path is correct relative to the notebook's location. If the image is in a different directory, provide the full path to the file in the `filename` parameter."
