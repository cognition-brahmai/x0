I was under the impression that when `mask_zero=True`, the output would be a sequence of zeros whenever the input value is zero. However, when trying to implement this in my model using the provided code, the output does not match my expectations. I thought that this function would allow subsequent layers to skip computation. Can anyone explain how this works?"

        "content": "The `mask_zero` parameter in the Keras `Embedding` layer is used to handle padding tokens in sequence data. When `mask_zero=True`, the embedding layer will treat the input value of zero as a special \"padding\" token. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Zero Masking**: When `mask_zero=True`, the input value of zero is not assigned an embedding vector. Instead, it is ignored in the computation of the sequence. This is useful when zero is used to pad sequences to a common length.\n\n2. **Mask Propagation**: The embedding layer generates a mask that indicates which positions in the input sequence are padding (i.e., zero). This mask is propagated to subsequent layers in the model, allowing them to skip computation for these positions if they are designed to support masking (e.g., LSTM, GRU layers in Keras).\n\n3. **Output Shape**: The output shape of the embedding layer is not affected by zero masking. The layer will still output a dense vector for each input token, but the mask informs downstream layers which vectors correspond to padding.\n\n4. **Usage in RNNs**: In RNNs, this mask ensures that the recurrent layers do not compute states for padded positions, effectively \"skipping\" them, which helps in learning sequences of varying lengths without being biased by the padding.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the embedding layer itself does not output a sequence of zeros. Instead, it produces the usual embedding for non-zero indices, and the mask informs subsequent layers about the padding positions.\n\nIf your downstream layers (like RNNs) are not behaving as expected, make sure they are compatible with masking. Use layers that support masking, and that the mask is properly propagated throughout the model. If you're using custom layers, you might need to handle the mask manually."
