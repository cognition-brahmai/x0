        "content": "In the `requests` library, cookies are typically associated with the `Response` object, as you've shown in your example. However, if you want to see the cookies that are being sent with a `Request` object, you need to use a `Session` object. The `Session` object allows you to persist certain parameters, like cookies, across multiple requests.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to access the cookies in a `Request` object using a `Session`:\n\n1. **Create a Session**: This will allow you to persist cookies across requests.\n2. **Make a Request**: Use the session to make your request.\n3. **Inspect the Cookies**: You can inspect the cookies stored in the session.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# Create a session object\nsession = requests.Session()\n\n# Make a POST request\nresponse = session.post(url, data=data)\n\n# Access the cookies sent with the request (if any)\nrequest_cookies = session.cookies\n\nprint(request_cookies)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `session.cookies` contains all the cookies that are stored in the session, which includes any cookies set by the server in the `Response` and any cookies you've manually added to the session. If you want to add cookies manually to a request, you can do so by updating the session's cookies:\n\n```python\n# Add cookies to the session\nsession.cookies.set('cookie_name', 'cookie_value')\n\n# Make another request\nresponse = session.get(url)\n\n# Now session.cookies will include the manually added cookies\n```\n\nRemember that cookies are key-value pairs. You can access them individually if needed:\n\n```python\nfor cookie in session.cookies:\n    print(cookie.name, cookie.value)\n```\n\nThis approach provides a complete way to manage and inspect cookies when making requests using the `requests` library in Python."
