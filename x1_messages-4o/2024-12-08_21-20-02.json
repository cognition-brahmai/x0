        "content": "To analyze the sentiment of lines from famous poetry using a SQL database, you would typically need to integrate a natural language processing (NLP) library or API that can process the text and return sentiment scores. SQL itself doesn't have built-in capabilities for sentiment analysis, but you can use a procedural language extension like PL/pgSQL for PostgreSQL or a similar feature in other databases to call external functions.\n\nHere's a conceptual outline of what you might do:\n\n1. **Set up a sentiment analysis function**: You would need to have a sentiment analysis function accessible from your database. This might be a Python function using a library like TextBlob or an API call to a service like AWS Comprehend or Google Cloud Natural Language.\n\n2. **Use a SQL extension to call this function**: In PostgreSQL, you might use PL/Python to create a function that wraps the sentiment analysis.\n\nHere's a conceptual example using PostgreSQL with PL/Python:\n\n```sql\n-- Install the PL/Python extension, if not already available\nCREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS plpythonu;\n\n-- Create a function that uses a Python library for sentiment analysis\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION analyze_sentiment(text) RETURNS TABLE(sentiment_score float) AS $$\nfrom textblob import TextBlob\n\ndef analyze_sentiment(text):\n    blob = TextBlob(text)\n    return (blob.sentiment.polarity,)\n\nreturn analyze_sentiment(args[0])\n$$ LANGUAGE plpythonu;\n\n-- Use the function to analyze sentiment for each line\nSELECT Line_Number, Poem_Title, Author, Line_Text, analyze_sentiment(Line_Text) AS Sentiment_Score\nFROM poetry_lines;\n```\n\nPlease note that this example assumes you have Python and the necessary libraries installed and configured to work with PostgreSQL.\n\nNow, for the second part of your request, here's an original poem about data science inspired by the concept of sentiment analysis:\n\n---\n\n**The Dance of Data**\n\nIn the realm of endless data streams,  \nWhere numbers weave intricate dreams,  \nA whisper of patterns softly speaks,  \nIn algorithms' embrace, knowledge peaks.\n\nLines of code like verses flow,  \nThrough tangled nets, insights grow.  \nFrom chaos, clarity takes its stand,  \nGuided by a machine's gentle hand.\n\nIn the silence, data sings,  \nOf mysteries solved and the truths it brings.  \nAn ode to science, vast and grand,  \nWritten by logic's deft command.\n\nWith every query, a story unfolds,  \nIn the language of data, bold and untold.  \nA dance of numbers, a symphony sublime,  \nIn the heart of science, transcending time.\n\n---\n\nFeel free to modify and expand this poem as you see fit!"
