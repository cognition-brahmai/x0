The variables I wish to set are as follows:\n\n```python\nexport DATABASE_URL=postgres://127.0.0.1:5432/my_db_name\nexport DEBUG=1\n# there are other variables, but they contain personal information\n```\n\nI have tried setting the environment variables in 'Preferences' -> 'Build, Execution, Deployment' -> 'Console' -> 'Python Console'/'Django Console', but this approach seems to only set the variables for the interpreter. I also looked at a solution provided on a StackOverflow thread but it does not help with my specific issue. How can I set these environment variables in PyCharm without setting them manually or having a bash file to source?"

        "content": "To set environment variables in PyCharm for your Django project without using a bash file or setting them manually each time, you can configure them within the PyCharm run/debug configuration for your project. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Open Run/Debug Configurations:**\n   - Go to the top-right corner of PyCharm, where you see the dropdown menu with your current run configuration (it might say something like \"Django Server\" or \"manage.py task\").\n   - Click on the dropdown and select \"Edit Configurations...\" from the list.\n\n2. **Select or Create a Configuration for Your Django Project:**\n   - If you have an existing configuration for running your Django project, select it. If not, you can create a new one by clicking the \"+\" icon and choosing \"Django Server\" or \"Python\" depending on your setup.\n\n3. **Set Environment Variables:**\n   - Within the selected configuration, find the \"Environment variables\" section.\n   - Click on the \"...\" button next to it to open the Environment Variables dialog.\n   - Add your environment variables here. For example:\n     - `DATABASE_URL=postgres://127.0.0.1:5432/my_db_name`\n     - `DEBUG=1`\n     - Add any other variables you need, ensuring that you don't include sensitive information in the dialog if it's shared or visible to others.\n\n4. **Apply and Close:**\n   - Once you've added all your environment variables, click \"OK\" to close the dialog.\n   - Then, click \"Apply\" and \"OK\" to close the Run/Debug Configurations window.\n\n5. **Run Your Project:**\n   - Now, when you run your Django project using this configuration, the environment variables you've set will be applied automatically.\n\nThis method ensures that your environment variables are set specifically for your Django project within PyCharm, without the need for manual setting or external scripts."
