The old alias names like 'collections.MutableMapping' are going to be removed in Python 3.8 and produce a deprecation warning in Python 3.7. Here is the warning I receive when I use the alias names in Python 3.7:\n\n```\n./scripts/generateBoard.py:145: DeprecationWarning: Using or importing the ABCs from 'collections' instead of from 'collections.abc' is deprecated, and in 3.8 it will stop working\n  elif isinstance(value, (collections.MutableMapping, collections.MutableSequence)) == True:\n```\n\nOn the other hand, Python 2.7 does not have 'collections.abc'. What is the most convenient way to handle this difference in a Python script that is meant to be used with almost any Python version? I am looking for a solution that ideally resolves this issue in one central place, without having to use 'try: ... except: ...' throughout the script every time I need this type."

        "content": "To handle the differences between Python 2.7 and Python 3.8+ regarding the import of abstract base classes from `collections.abc`, you can create a compatibility layer in your code. This involves defining a common import path based on the Python version being used. Here's a way to manage this centrally in your script:\n\n1. Create a module or a section at the beginning of your script to handle imports based on the Python version.\n\n2. Use a try-except block to determine the Python version and import the abstract base classes accordingly.\n\nHere's an example of how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nif sys.version_info[0] == 2:\n    # Python 2.7\n    import collections\n    MutableMapping = collections.MutableMapping\n    MutableSequence = collections.MutableSequence\nelse:\n    # Python 3.3+\n    import collections.abc\n    MutableMapping = collections.abc.MutableMapping\n    MutableSequence = collections.abc.MutableSequence\n\n# Now you can use MutableMapping and MutableSequence in your script\n# without worrying about the version differences\n\n# Example usage\ndef process_value(value):\n    if isinstance(value, (MutableMapping, MutableSequence)):\n        # Your logic here\n        pass\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Version Check**: The `sys.version_info` tuple is used to check the major version of Python. If the major version is `2`, it assumes Python 2.7, otherwise it considers Python 3.3+.\n\n- **Import Handling**: Based on the version, it imports the necessary classes from either `collections` or `collections.abc`.\n\n- **Centralized Solution**: This setup ensures that you only need to handle the version difference in one place. You then use `MutableMapping` and `MutableSequence` throughout the rest of your code without worrying about version-specific imports.\n\nThis method simplifies maintaining compatibility across different Python versions and avoids repeated `try-except` blocks throughout your code."
