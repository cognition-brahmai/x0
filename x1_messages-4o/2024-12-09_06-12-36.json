        "content": "The \"Unexpected indent\" error in Python typically occurs when there is an indentation in a place where the interpreter does not expect it. Python relies on indentation to define blocks of code, so it's crucial to maintain consistent indentation throughout your script. Here's how you can resolve this error:\n\n1. **Check for Consistent Indentation:**\n   - Ensure that you are using the same type of indentation throughout your code. Python allows both spaces and tabs, but it's best to choose one and stick with it. The standard is to use 4 spaces per indentation level.\n\n2. **Look for Accidental Indentation:**\n   - Check if there are any lines that are indented without any reason. This often happens if you accidentally press the Tab or Space key.\n\n3. **Review Previous Lines:**\n   - Ensure that the indentation of your lines makes sense in the context of the surrounding code. For example, if you have an `if` statement, the block of code that follows it should be indented.\n\n4. **Check for Mixed Indentation:**\n   - Some editors allow mixing tabs and spaces, which might cause issues. Use your editor's feature to convert all tabs to spaces or vice versa.\n\n5. **Use an IDE or Text Editor that Highlights Indentation:**\n   - Many IDEs and text editors highlight or provide visual guides for indentation. This can help you spot and fix any issues quickly.\n\n6. **Automate Indentation Correction:**\n   - Some IDEs have a feature to automatically correct or adjust indentation. For example, in Visual Studio Code, you can use the \"Format Document\" feature.\n\n7. **Inspect Code Blocks:**\n   - Make sure that all blocks of code (loops, functions, conditionals, etc.) have consistent indentation and that their start and end are clear.\n\nHere's a simple example to illustrate correct indentation:\n\n```python\nif condition:\n    print(\"This line is properly indented.\")\n    if another_condition:\n        print(\"This line is even more indented.\")\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the \"Unexpected indent\" error in your Python code. If you still encounter issues, try sharing the specific part of the code where the error occurs, and I can assist you further."
