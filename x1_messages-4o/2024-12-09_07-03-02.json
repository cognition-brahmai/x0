I want to know if there's a way to find out the exact line which is executing a particular print statement. Although I understand that using the Search function in IDEs like Pydev or using grep with the -rn flag can help me find these lines, I am looking for a more specific solution, especially for situations where I have used a print statement like print(x) and x does not begin or end with quotes."

        "content": "To find the exact lines where specific `print` statements are executing in your Python code, you can use a few strategies that complement the standard search functions:\n\n1. **Use a Wrapper Function**:\n   Create a custom print function that logs additional information, such as the file name and line number where it's called. This can be particularly useful if you're working on a large project.\n\n   ```python\n   import inspect\n\n   def debug_print(*args, **kwargs):\n       frame = inspect.currentframe().f_back\n       filename = frame.f_code.co_filename\n       line_number = frame.f_lineno\n       print(f\"{filename}:{line_number} -\", *args, **kwargs)\n\n   # Usage\n   debug_print(x)\n   ```\n\n   Replace your `print(x)` statements with `debug_print(x)` and you'll see the filename and line number in the output.\n\n2. **Use a Logger with Custom Formatting**:\n   Python's logging module provides a robust way to include detailed information about the context of a log message, such as file name and line number.\n\n   ```python\n   import logging\n\n   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(filename)s:%(lineno)d - %(message)s')\n   \n   def debug_print(message):\n       logging.debug(message)\n\n   # Usage\n   debug_print(x)\n   ```\n\n   This way, you can easily track where each debug message is coming from.\n\n3. **Use Decorators to Track Execution**:\n   Another advanced method is to use decorators to automatically wrap functions where you want to track print statements.\n\n   ```python\n   import inspect\n\n   def trace(func):\n       def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n           frame = inspect.currentframe().f_back\n           filename = frame.f_code.co_filename\n           line_number = frame.f_lineno\n           print(f\"Calling {func.__name__} from {filename}:{line_number}\")\n           return func(*args, **kwargs)\n       return wrapper\n\n   @trace\n   def my_function():\n       print(x)\n\n   # Usage\n   my_function()\n   ```\n\n   This approach can help you identify where function calls (and their prints) originate.\n\nBy using one or more of these strategies, you can gain a clearer understanding of where specific print statements are being executed in your Python code."
