        "content": "Sure! To calculate the orbital period of a planet around the Sun using the formula \\( P^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{GM} \\times a^3 \\), you'll need to follow these steps in a Shell command. Here, \\( P \\) is the orbital period, \\( a \\) is the semi-major axis in meters, \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant approximately equal to \\( 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}^3\\text{kg}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-2} \\), and \\( M \\) is the mass of the Sun, approximately \\( 1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\, \\text{kg} \\).\n\n### Shell Command to Calculate Orbital Period\n\n```sh\n# Define constants\nG=6.674e-11\nM=1.989e30\nPI=3.141592653589793\n\n# Define semi-major axis 'a' in meters (example: Earth's semi-major axis)\na=149597870700 # 1 astronomical unit in meters\n\n# Calculate P^2 using the formula\nP_squared=$(echo \"scale=10; (4 * $PI^2 / ($G * $M)) * ($a^3)\" | bc -l)\n\n# Calculate P (orbital period) by taking the square root of P^2\nP=$(echo \"scale=10; sqrt($P_squared)\" | bc -l)\n\n# Convert the period from seconds to years (optional)\nP_years=$(echo \"scale=10; $P / (60 * 60 * 24 * 365.25)\" | bc -l)\n\necho \"The orbital period in seconds is: $P\"\necho \"The orbital period in years is: $P_years\"\n```\n\n### Identify Two Celestial Bodies\n\nFor identifying celestial bodies in the planetary system, you will typically need to reference a database or list that contains information about the planets and other celestial bodies orbiting the Sun. However, you can create a simple script to list known planets:\n\n```sh\n# List of planets in our solar system\nplanets=(\"Mercury\" \"Venus\" \"Earth\" \"Mars\" \"Jupiter\" \"Saturn\" \"Uranus\" \"Neptune\")\n\n# Output two celestial bodies\necho \"Two celestial bodies orbiting the Sun are: ${planets[0]} and ${planets[1]}\"\n```\n\nThese commands should help you calculate the orbital period and identify celestial bodies in a basic shell environment. Remember that for more complex queries regarding celestial bodies, integration with astronomical databases or APIs would be required."
