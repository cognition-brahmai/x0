I am currently working on a list of publications, and I want each publication to have a link marked \"DOI\" at the end. However, when I try to implement this, I encounter a warning that says \"Duplicate explicit target name: 'doi'\". The error seems to change depending on the version of docutils I am using, but all versions have failed. Is there a way to achieve this? Here's the code I am using:\n\n```python\n1. `link <http://www.google.com>`__\n2. `link <http://www.yahoo.com>`__\n```\n\nI want to have the result as:\n\n```html\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.google.com\">link</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.yahoo.com\">link</a></li>\n</ol>\n```"

        "content": "When using reStructuredText (reST) to generate multiple links with the same text, you might encounter issues with duplicate target names if you try to use identical explicit targets. In reST, each explicit hyperlink target must be unique, but there are ways to have multiple links with the same visible text without triggering an error.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this:\n\nUse anonymous hyperlinks. Anonymous hyperlinks do not require a unique target name and are perfect for situations where you want to use the same link text multiple times.\n\nHere's how your example can be written using anonymous links:\n\n```rst\n1. `link <http://www.google.com>`__\n2. `link <http://www.yahoo.com>`__\n```\n\nThis should work correctly and generate the desired HTML output without any warnings about duplicate explicit target names.\n\nIf you need to use named links (e.g., for a more complex document), ensure each target name is unique. However, for the situation you described, anonymous links are the simplest and most effective solution."
