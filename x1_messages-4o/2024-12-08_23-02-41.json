You need to implement a logic that can replace the sentence with \"I have been assigned to complete the task at hand\" using a function that accepts two arguments: the original sentence and the modified sentence. The function should also return the modified sentence. Can you solve this language puzzle?"

        "content": "Certainly! Below is a C++ code snippet that defines a function `convertToFormalTone` which takes two arguments: the original sentence and a reference to the modified sentence. The function replaces the original sentence with a more formal one and returns the modified sentence.\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n\nstd::string convertToFormalTone(const std::string& original, std::string& modified) {\n    // Define the formal version of the sentence\n    const std::string formalVersion = \"I have been assigned to complete the task at hand\";\n    \n    // Check if the input sentence matches the expected original sentence\n    if (original == \"I was requested to accomplish the task\") {\n        // Update the modified sentence\n        modified = formalVersion;\n    } else {\n        // If the sentence doesn't match, retain the original sentence\n        modified = original;\n    }\n    \n    // Return the modified sentence\n    return modified;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::string originalSentence = \"I was requested to accomplish the task\";\n    std::string modifiedSentence;\n    \n    std::string result = convertToFormalTone(originalSentence, modifiedSentence);\n    \n    std::cout << \"Original Sentence: \" << originalSentence << std::endl;\n    std::cout << \"Modified Sentence: \" << result << std::endl;\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function `convertToFormalTone` takes the original sentence as input and a reference to the `modified` sentence.\n- It checks if the original sentence matches \"I was requested to accomplish the task\".\n- If it matches, it sets the `modified` sentence to \"I have been assigned to complete the task at hand\".\n- If it doesn't match, it leaves the `modified` sentence unchanged.\n- The function returns the `modified` sentence, which is printed in the `main` function."
