The error stack trace is as follows:\n\n```\nFile \"C:\\Python26\\lib\\shutil.py\", line 216, in rmtree\n   rmtree(fullname, ignore_errors, onerror)\n File \"C:\\Python26\\lib\\shutil.py\", line 216, in rmtree\n   rmtree(fullname, ignore_errors, onerror)\n File \"C:\\Python26\\lib\\shutil.py\", line 216, in rmtree\n   rmtree(fullname, ignore_errors, onerror)\n File \"C:\\Python26\\lib\\shutil.py\", line 216, in rmtree\n   rmtree(fullname, ignore_errors, onerror)\n File \"C:\\Python26\\lib\\shutil.py\", line 216, in rmtree\n   rmtree(fullname, ignore_errors, onerror)\n File \"C:\\Python26\\lib\\shutil.py\", line 216, in rmtree\n   rmtree(fullname, ignore_errors, onerror)\n File \"C:\\Python26\\lib\\shutil.py\", line 216, in rmtree\n   rmtree(fullname, ignore_errors, onerror)\n File \"C:\\Python26\\lib\\shutil.py\", line 221, in rmtree\n   onerror(os.remove, fullname, sys.exc_info())\n File \"C:\\Python26\\lib\\shutil.py\", line 219, in rmtree\n   os.remove(fullname)\nWindowsError: [Error 5] Access is denied: 'build\\\\tcl\\\\tcl8.5\\\\msgs\\\\af.msg'\n```\n\nI noticed that the `af.msg` file is set to be read-only. What is the simplest workaround/fix to get around this problem, given that my intention is to do an equivalent of `rm -rf build/` but on Windows, without having to use third-party tools like unxutils or cygwin as this code is targeted to be run on a bare Windows install with Python 2.6 w/ PyWin32 installed?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is caused by attempting to delete a read-only file using `shutil.rmtree`. On Windows, files marked as read-only cannot be deleted unless their read-only attribute is removed. You can address this problem by using the `os.chmod` function to change the file's attributes before deletion. Here's how you can implement a workaround:\n\n1. Define a function that will change the file permissions to allow deletion.\n2. Use the `onerror` callback parameter of `shutil.rmtree` to handle any errors encountered during file removal.\n\nHere's a sample implementation:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport shutil\nimport stat\n\ndef remove_readonly(func, path, excinfo):\n    # Check if the error is due to a read-only file\n    if not os.access(path, os.W_OK):\n        # Change the file's permissions to writable\n        os.chmod(path, stat.S_IWUSR)\n        # Try to remove the file again\n        func(path)\n    else:\n        # Raise the error if it's not related to file permissions\n        raise\n\n# Use shutil.rmtree with the onerror parameter\nshutil.rmtree('build', onerror=remove_readonly)\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The `remove_readonly` function checks if the file is writable using `os.access(path, os.W_OK)`. If not, it changes the file's permissions using `os.chmod(path, stat.S_IWUSR)` to make it writable.\n- The `shutil.rmtree` function is called with the `onerror` parameter set to `remove_readonly`, ensuring that any errors resulting from read-only files are handled appropriately.\n\nThis approach should enable you to delete the directory and its contents, including read-only files, without requiring third-party tools."
