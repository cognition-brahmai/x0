You can type the following in each cell:\n   - A1: Fruit Name\n   - B1: Quantity\n   - C1: Price per unit\n\n3. **Enter Data**: In the subsequent rows, enter the data for each fruit as follows:\n   - A2: Apple\n   - B2: 50\n   - C2: $0.5\n\n   - A3: Banana\n   - B3: 70\n   - C3: $0.3\n\n   - A4: Mango\n   - B4: 30\n   - C4: $0.8\n\n   - A5: Orange\n   - B5: 90\n   - C5: $0.4\n\n   - A6: Pineapple\n   - B6: 20\n   - C6: $1.2\n\n4. **Format as Table**: To make it look more organized, you can format this range as a table. Select the range A1:C6, go to the \"Insert\" tab, and click on \"Table\". Ensure \"My table has headers\" is checked, then click OK.\n\n5. **Adjust Column Widths**: Adjust the column widths so that all the data is clearly visible. You can do this by double-clicking on the line between each column header (e.g., between A and B) or by manually dragging it.\n\n6. **Add Borders**: For better readability, you can add borders to your table. Select the table, go to the \"Home\" tab, click on the \"Borders\" dropdown menu, and choose \"All Borders\".\n\n7. **Save Your Work**: Don\u2019t forget to save your file by clicking on \"File\" and then \"Save As\". Choose a location on your computer, give your file a name, and click \"Save\".\n\nBy following these steps, you will have a well-organized inventory list of all the fruits in your grocery store using an Excel table."
