The population density and growth rates can vary significantly depending on the specific data source and time frame, but generally, Melbourne is known for its relatively high population density compared to other Australian cities.\n\n### Population Growth\nThe exact percentage increase or decrease in Melbourne's population since the last census can be determined by consulting the most recent census data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).

Melbourne has a diverse economy with strengths in finance, manufacturing, research, IT, education, logistics, transportation, and tourism.
