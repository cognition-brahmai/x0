The script I am currently using to perform this task is running slower than I would like. Is there something obvious I could be missing that might be slowing down the performance of my script?\n\nHere is the data structure I am working with:\n```\ndata = {\"SomeCity\": {\"Date1\": {record1, record2, record3, ...}, \"Date2\": {}, ...}, ...}\n```\n\nAnd this is the script in question:\n```\ncity = [\"SomeCity\"]\ndf = DataFrame({}, columns=['Date', 'HouseID', 'Price'])\nfor city in cities:\n    for dateRun in data[city]:\n        for record in data[city][dateRun]:\n            recSeries = Series([record['Timestamp'], \n                                record['Id'], \n                                record['Price']],\n                                index = ['Date', 'HouseID', 'Price'])\n            FredDF = FredDF.append(recSeries, ignore_index=True)\n```"

        "content": "Appending rows one by one to a Pandas DataFrame using the `append` method can be quite inefficient, especially when dealing with large datasets. This is because DataFrames are not designed to be mutable, and each call to `append` creates a new DataFrame, copying the data each time, which can be very slow with millions of records.\n\nTo improve performance, you can use the following approach:\n\n1. **Use a list to accumulate rows**: Instead of appending to the DataFrame in each iteration, accumulate dictionaries or lists in a list and then create the DataFrame in one go at the end.\n\n2. **Create the DataFrame all at once**: Once you have accumulated the data, create the DataFrame in one operation.\n\nHere is how you can modify your script:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ncities = [\"SomeCity\"]\ndata = {\n    \"SomeCity\": {\n        \"Date1\": [\n            {'Timestamp': '2023-01-01', 'Id': 1, 'Price': 100000},\n            {'Timestamp': '2023-01-02', 'Id': 2, 'Price': 150000},\n            # add more records\n        ],\n        \"Date2\": [\n            {'Timestamp': '2023-01-03', 'Id': 3, 'Price': 200000},\n            # add more records\n        ],\n        # add more dates\n    },\n    # add more cities\n}\n\nrows = []  # List to accumulate the rows\n\n# Iterate over your nested dictionary structure\nfor city in cities:\n    for dateRun, records in data[city].items():\n        for record in records:\n            row = {\n                'Date': record['Timestamp'],\n                'HouseID': record['Id'],\n                'Price': record['Price']\n            }\n            rows.append(row)\n\n# Create a DataFrame from the list of rows\nFredDF = pd.DataFrame(rows, columns=['Date', 'HouseID', 'Price'])\n\nprint(FredDF)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Accumulation in List**: We accumulate all the data as dictionaries in a list called `rows`. Each dictionary represents a row in the DataFrame.\n- **Batch Creation**: We then create the DataFrame from the list of dictionaries, which is much more efficient than appending rows one by one.\n\nThis approach should considerably speed up the data insertion into the DataFrame, especially with a large number of records."
