I'm using the following code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nx = np.linspace(0,2*np.pi,100)\ny = np.sin(x)**2\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(x,y)\n\nlabels = ax.get_xticklabels()\nfor label in labels:\n    print(label)\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nHowever, even before I show or save the plot, I'm getting empty strings as the tick labels. The output I'm getting is:\n\n```\nText(0,0,'')\nText(0,0,'')\nText(0,0,'')\nText(0,0,'')\nText(0,0,'')\nText(0,0,'')\nText(0,0,'')\nText(0,0,'')\n```\n\nI have tried using `ax.xaxis.get_ticklabels()` and it gives the same result. Interestingly, if I move the tick label retrieval after the `plt.show()`, the labels are populated correctly. I'm using Mac OS X Yosemite, Matplotlib 1.5.1. Why is this happening and how can I get the tick labels before I show or save the plot?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is related to how Matplotlib manages the rendering of plots. When you call `plt.show()`, it triggers the rendering process and finalizes various plot elements, including tick labels. Before this, the tick labels may not be fully initialized, which is why you're seeing empty strings.\n\nIn Matplotlib, the actual rendering of the plot (including the computation of tick labels) often doesn't occur until the plot is displayed or saved. However, you can force the figure to be drawn without displaying it by using the `draw` method from the backend, which initializes these elements:\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to retrieve the tick labels before showing the plot:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nx = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)\ny = np.sin(x)**2\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(x, y)\n\n# Force the figure to draw\nfig.canvas.draw()\n\n# Get tick labels after drawing the canvas\nlabels = ax.get_xticklabels()\nfor label in labels:\n    print(label.get_text())\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nBy calling `fig.canvas.draw()`, you force the backend to render the figure, which ensures that the tick labels are populated and can be retrieved correctly. This should solve the problem and allow you to access the tick labels before showing the plot."
