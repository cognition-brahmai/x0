        "content": "In Selenium WebDriver for Python, you can obtain the current URL of the page after performing a series of navigations by using the `current_url` property of the WebDriver instance. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom selenium import webdriver\n\n# Initialize the WebDriver (for example, using Chrome)\ndriver = webdriver.Chrome()\n\n# Navigate to a URL\ndriver.get('https://example.com')\n\n# Perform a series of navigations\n# driver.get('https://another-example.com')\n# driver.find_element_by_link_text('Some Link').click()\n# Add other navigation steps as needed\n\n# Get the current URL\ncurrent_url = driver.current_url\nprint(f\"The current URL is: {current_url}\")\n\n# Close the WebDriver\ndriver.quit()\n```\n\nIn the above code:\n\n- We first initialize the WebDriver (in this case, using Chrome, but you can use other browsers like Firefox, Edge, etc.).\n- We then navigate to a URL using `driver.get()`.\n- After performing any additional navigations or actions, you can retrieve the current URL by accessing `driver.current_url`.\n- Finally, we print the current URL and close the WebDriver.\n\nThis approach is straightforward and works similarly across different browsers supported by Selenium WebDriver."
