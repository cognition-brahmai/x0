        "content": "In Python, if a SIGTERM signal is received and there is no specific signal handler registered for it, the default behavior is for the program to terminate. This is because SIGTERM is intended to request a graceful termination of a program. When Python receives this signal without a custom handler, it will perform a clean exit, which includes:\n\n1. Terminating the program: The process will exit with a specific exit code, typically 143 on Unix-like systems, indicating that it was terminated by a SIGTERM signal.\n\n2. Cleanup: Python will take care of some basic cleanup operations, such as flushing and closing open files, and deallocating memory. However, it won't execute any Python-level cleanup code (like `finally` blocks or object destructors) unless explicitly caught and handled.\n\nIf you want to handle SIGTERM in a specific way, you can register a signal handler using the `signal` module in Python. This allows you to define custom behaviors, such as logging, cleanup activities, or even ignoring the signal. Here's an example of how you can set up a signal handler for SIGTERM:\n\n```python\nimport signal\nimport sys\n\ndef handle_sigterm(signum, frame):\n    print(\"Received SIGTERM, performing cleanup...\")\n    # Perform any cleanup tasks here\n    sys.exit(0)\n\n# Register the signal handler\nsignal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, handle_sigterm)\n\n# Your program logic here\nwhile True:\n    pass\n```\n\nIn this example, when a SIGTERM signal is received, the `handle_sigterm` function will be called, allowing you to perform any necessary cleanup before exiting the program."
