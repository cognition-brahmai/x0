        "content": "Design a scavenger hunt for kids, taking into consideration their age range, interests, and cognitive abilities. The hunt must include at least five different types of clues, such as riddles, puzzles, physical challenges, and hidden objects. Each clue should lead to the next, and the final prize should be age-appropriate and exciting for the kids. In addition, the scavenger hunt should take place in a safe and supervised environment, with clear boundaries and instructions for the kids to follow. The clues can be presented in various forms, such as written instructions, audio recordings, or even QR codes that the kids need to scan with their smartphones. To make the scavenger hunt more challenging, consider adding time limits, bonus tasks, or team competitions. Finally, make sure to have backup plans in case of unforeseen circumstances, such as bad weather or unexpected obstacles."
