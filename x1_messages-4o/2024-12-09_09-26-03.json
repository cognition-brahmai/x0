        "content": "Creating a TypeScript application to store and display students' exam scores involves setting up a basic TypeScript project, defining data structures, and implementing logic to manage and display the scores. Below is a simple example of how you could structure such an application:\n\n1. **Set up a TypeScript project:**\n\n   First, you need to initialize a TypeScript project. You can do this by creating a `package.json` file and installing TypeScript.\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir StudentScoresApp\n   cd StudentScoresApp\n   npm init -y\n   npm install typescript --save-dev\n   npx tsc --init\n   ```\n\n   This will create a basic `tsconfig.json` file.\n\n2. **Create the TypeScript code:**\n\n   Create a file named `app.ts` and add the following code:\n\n   ```typescript\n   // Define the structure for a student's exam score\n   interface StudentScore {\n     studentId: number;\n     name: string;\n     scores: Record<string, number>; // A record of subject and score\n   }\n\n   // Create an array to store students' scores\n   let studentScores: StudentScore[] = [];\n\n   // Function to add a student's scores\n   function addStudentScore(studentId: number, name: string, scores: Record<string, number>) {\n     const newStudentScore: StudentScore = { studentId, name, scores };\n     studentScores.push(newStudentScore);\n   }\n\n   // Function to display all students' scores\n   function displayStudentScores() {\n     console.log(\"Student Scores:\");\n     studentScores.forEach((student) => {\n       console.log(`ID: ${student.studentId}, Name: ${student.name}`);\n       for (const subject in student.scores) {\n         console.log(`  Subject: ${subject}, Score: ${student.scores[subject]}`);\n       }\n     });\n   }\n\n   // Add some sample data\n   addStudentScore(1, \"Alice\", { Math: 95, English: 88 });\n   addStudentScore(2, \"Bob\", { Math: 78, Science: 85 });\n\n   // Display the scores\n   displayStudentScores();\n   ```\n\n3. **Compile and run the TypeScript code:**\n\n   To compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript, run the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   npx tsc\n   ```\n\n   This will generate a JavaScript file named `app.js`.\n\n4. **Run the compiled JavaScript file:**\n\n   You can run the compiled JavaScript file using Node.js:\n\n   ```bash\n   node app.js\n   ```\n\nThis will output the stored student scores to the console. You can expand this basic application by adding more features, such as updating scores, removing students, or storing data in a database."
