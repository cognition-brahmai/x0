I attempted this with the following code but it is not working as expected. Can someone help me identify the mistake in my code?\n\n```\nfor files in os.listdir(\"dataset3\"):\n    if os.path.exists(\"dataset\"):\n        os.system(\"rm -rf \"+\"dataset\")\n```"

        "content": "Your code has a couple of issues that need to be addressed:\n\n1. The `os.path.exists(\"dataset\")` check is not verifying the path inside the \"dataset3\" folder. Instead, it's checking for a \"dataset\" folder in the current working directory.\n2. The `os.system(\"rm -rf \"+\"dataset\")` command is also attempting to remove a \"dataset\" folder from the current working directory, not from within \"dataset3\".\n\nHere is a revised version of your code that should work as expected:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport shutil\n\n# Specify the path to the \"dataset\" folder inside \"dataset3\"\ndataset_path = os.path.join(\"dataset3\", \"dataset\")\n\n# Check if the \"dataset\" folder exists within \"dataset3\"\nif os.path.exists(dataset_path):\n    # Remove the \"dataset\" folder and its contents\n    shutil.rmtree(dataset_path)\n    print(f\"Removed '{dataset_path}' successfully.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"'{dataset_path}' does not exist.\")\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n- **Path Correction**: Use `os.path.join()` to construct the path to the \"dataset\" folder inside \"dataset3\".\n- **Removal Method**: Use `shutil.rmtree()` to remove a directory and its contents safely in Python.\n- **Feedback**: Added print statements to inform you whether the folder was removed or did not exist."
