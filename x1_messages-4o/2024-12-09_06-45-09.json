        "content": "I am using the psycopg2 package with Python 2.7 and I consistently encounter an error: psycopg2.DatabaseError: SSL SYSCALL error: EOF detected. This error only seems to occur when I add a WHERE clause, specifically, WHERE column LIKE ''%X%'' to my pgrouting query. For instance, in my query:\n\n```\nSELECT id1 as node, cost FROM PGR_Driving_Distance(\n  'SELECT id, source, target, cost \n     FROM edge_table\n     WHERE cost IS NOT NULL and column LIKE ''%x%'' ',\n  1, 10, false, false)\n```\n\nAccording to various sources on the internet, the issue seems to be related to SSL. However, when I remove the pattern matching part of the query, the connection to the database works perfectly fine. I am currently running this on a local database on Xubuntu 13.10. I suspect that the pgrouting extension might be crashing the database due to a bad query, as there are no links that match this pattern. How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "The `psycopg2.DatabaseError: SSL SYSCALL error: EOF detected` error you are encountering can be tricky to diagnose because it typically indicates a problem with the database connection being unexpectedly closed. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and hopefully resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check for NULL Values:**\n   Ensure that there are no `NULL` values in the `column` you are using in the `LIKE` clause. If `NULL` values exist, you might want to filter them out explicitly.\n\n   ```sql\n   WHERE cost IS NOT NULL AND column IS NOT NULL AND column LIKE '%x%'\n   ```\n\n2. **Increase Timeout:**\n   Sometimes the database connection can time out if the query takes too long. Try increasing the connection timeout settings in your `psycopg2` connection configuration:\n\n   ```python\n   connection = psycopg2.connect(\n       dbname=\"your_dbname\",\n       user=\"your_user\",\n       password=\"your_password\",\n       host=\"your_host\",\n       sslmode=\"require\",\n       connect_timeout=60  # Increase this value\n   )\n   ```\n\n3. **Check PostgreSQL Logs:**\n   Examine the PostgreSQL server logs to see if there are any error messages or warnings that provide more context about the disconnection. These logs can often provide clues about what might be going wrong.\n\n4. **Validate Query Logic:**\n   Double-check the logic of your query, particularly the `LIKE` clause. If there are no rows that match the pattern, it might be causing the pgrouting function to behave unexpectedly. Consider testing the inner query separately to verify its results.\n\n5. **Update Software:**\n   Ensure that you are using the latest versions of PostgreSQL, `psycopg2`, and pgRouting. Sometimes, bugs are fixed in newer versions that could resolve your issue.\n\n6. **Test without SSL:**\n   If you are running the database locally, consider testing the connection without SSL to see if it resolves the issue. This can help isolate whether SSL is indeed the culprit.\n\n   ```python\n   connection = psycopg2.connect(\n       dbname=\"your_dbname\",\n       user=\"your_user\",\n       password=\"your_password\",\n       host=\"your_host\",\n       sslmode=\"disable\"  # Disable SSL for testing\n   )\n   ```\n\n7. **Simplify Query:**\n   Try simplifying your query to isolate the problem. For instance, remove the `pgrouting` function and just run the `SELECT` statement with the `LIKE` clause to see if it executes without errors.\n\n8. **Review Resource Limits:**\n   Check if there are any resource limits being hit on your database server, such as memory or CPU constraints, that could be causing the connection to drop.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, you might need to consider more in-depth debugging, potentially involving network traffic analysis or consulting with a database administrator to further diagnose the problem."
