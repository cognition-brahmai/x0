Like this:\n\n```python\nob = MyClass()\nv = ob.a   # Here I expect ob.a to return 'v1'\n```\nI understand this should be implemented with __getattr__, but as a beginner, I'm not quite sure how to do this. Could you provide some guidance on how to implement __getattr__() to achieve this functionality?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired functionality where you can access dictionary values using the instance of your class, you can indeed use the `__getattr__` method. This method is a special function in Python that is called when the attribute you're trying to access doesn't exist in the usual places (i.e., it's not a direct attribute of the instance). Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nclass MyClass(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.data = {'a': 'v1', 'b': 'v2'}\n    \n    def __getattr__(self, name):\n        # This method is called when an attribute is not found\n        if name in self.data:\n            return self.data[name]\n        # If the attribute is not in the dictionary, raise an AttributeError\n        raise AttributeError(f\"'{self.__class__.__name__}' object has no attribute '{name}'\")\n\n# Usage\nob = MyClass()\nv1 = ob.a  # This will return 'v1'\nv2 = ob.b  # This will return 'v2'\n\nprint(f\"Value of ob.a: {v1}\")\nprint(f\"Value of ob.b: {v2}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- `__getattr__`: This method is invoked when you try to access an attribute that isn't found directly in the instance's `__dict__` or class attributes. In this case, if the attribute name exists in the `data` dictionary, it returns the corresponding value.\n  \n- The `raise AttributeError` line is crucial because if the attribute queried doesn't exist in the `data` dictionary, Python should raise an `AttributeError` to maintain expected behavior.\n\nThis setup allows you to dynamically access dictionary keys as attributes of your class instance."
