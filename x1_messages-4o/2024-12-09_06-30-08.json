How can I accomplish this?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired transformation, you can utilize the `pandas` library in Python. The goal is to group the DataFrame by consecutive index numbers and then pivot them into columns. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. First, identify the groups of consecutive indices.\n2. Use these groups to create new columns in the DataFrame.\n\nHere's a sample code that demonstrates how to do this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    0: [19218.965703, 19247.621650, 19232.651322, 19279.216956, 19330.087371, 19304.316973]\n}\nindex = [0, 1, 2, 9, 10, 11]\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data, index=index)\n\n# Identify the groups of consecutive index numbers\ndf['group'] = (df.index.to_series().diff() != 1).cumsum()\n\n# Create a new DataFrame by pivoting the groups\nresult = df.groupby('group').apply(lambda x: pd.Series(x[0].values)).reset_index(drop=True)\n\n# Rename columns for clarity\nresult.columns = [f'Column_{i}' for i in result.columns]\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Grouping**: The `diff()` method calculates the difference between the current index and the previous index. If it's not equal to 1, it indicates a break in sequence, and a new group is started. The `cumsum()` method is used to cumulatively sum these breaks to create a unique group identifier.\n- **Pivoting**: The `groupby()` method groups the data based on the identified groups, and then `apply()` is used to transform each group into a row of the new DataFrame.\n\nThis will give you the desired format where consecutive index values are pivoted as separate columns."
