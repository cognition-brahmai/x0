However, I am encountering an error when trying to import the 'reverse' module from 'django.urls'. The error message is \"ImportError: No module named urls\". I tried changing the ROOT_URLCONF to 'urls', but this didn't solve the issue. Here is the relevant code from my settings.py, urls.py, and polls/views.py files:\n\nsettings.py:\n```python\nROOT_URLCONF = 'mysite.urls'\n```\n\nurls.py:\n```python\nfrom django.conf.urls import url, include\nfrom django.contrib import admin\n\nurlpatterns = [\n    url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),\n    url(r'^polls/', include('polls.urls')),\n]\n```\n\npolls/views.py:\n```python\nfrom django.http import HttpResponse, HttpResponseRedirect\nfrom .models import Question, Choice\nfrom django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404, render\nfrom django.urls import reverse\n```\nCould you help me figure out why I am seeing this error and how to resolve it?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, \"ImportError: No module named urls\", suggests that there might be an issue with the import statement or the Django setup itself. Let's go through the possible reasons and solutions step-by-step:\n\n1. **Django Version**: Ensure that you are using a compatible Django version. The `from django.urls import reverse` is valid for Django 1.10 and later versions. If you're using an older version, consider upgrading your Django installation.\n\n2. **Python Environment**: Make sure you are working in the correct Python environment and that Django is installed. You can verify your Django installation by running:\n   ```bash\n   python -m django --version\n   ```\n\n3. **Correct Import Statement**: The import statement in your `polls/views.py` is correct for Django 1.10 and later:\n   ```python\n   from django.urls import reverse\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for Typos**: Verify that there are no typos in your import statement or elsewhere in your code that might lead to this error.\n\n5. **Django Setup**: Ensure that Django is properly set up in your project. Sometimes, issues in the project setup can cause import errors. You can try running:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py check\n   ```\n   This command will help identify any configuration issues.\n\n6. **Virtual Environment**: If you're using a virtual environment, ensure it's activated properly before running your Django project.\n\n7. **Verify Installed Apps**: Make sure that your `polls` app is added to the `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`:\n   ```python\n   INSTALLED_APPS = [\n       ...\n       'polls',\n   ]\n   ```\n\nIf you've checked all these and the issue persists, try creating a minimal Django project with just the necessary components to see if the problem replicates. This can help isolate the issue. If you encounter any specific error messages during these checks, feel free to share them for further assistance."
