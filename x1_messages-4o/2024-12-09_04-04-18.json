        "content": "Your current approach to create a new DataFrame `df2` by copying only the index from `df1` while removing all columns is quite efficient. However, there's a slightly more straightforward way to achieve the same result without the need to copy and then erase columns. You can directly create a new DataFrame using the index of `df1`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming df1 is already created from reading the CSV\ndf1 = pd.read_csv(\"1.txt\", index_col=\"TIME\")\n\n# Create an empty DataFrame with the same index as df1\ndf2 = pd.DataFrame(index=df1.index)\n\n# Add the new columns and compute their values\ndf2[\"results1\"] = df1[\"T1\"] * df1[\"T2\"] * 3\ndf2[\"results2\"] = df1[\"T2\"] + 100\n\nprint(df2)\n```\n\nThis method directly initializes `df2` with the same index as `df1`, which is a bit more explicit in terms of what you are trying to achieve. It also avoids the overhead of copying the data from `df1`, which can be beneficial in terms of memory usage, especially for large datasets."
