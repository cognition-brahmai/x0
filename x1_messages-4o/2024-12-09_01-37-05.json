        "content": "To modify the `TestSpeedRetrieval` function to accept a class name as a parameter, you can refactor the code to make it more generic. This will allow you to pass the class directly or by its name as a string. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n1. Add a method to handle the retrieval of data based on the provided class.\n2. Modify the `get` method to use this new method for fetching data.\n\nHere is how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nclass TestSpeedRetrieval(webapp.RequestHandler):\n    \"\"\"\n    Test retrieval times of various important records in the BigTable database \n    \"\"\"\n    def get(self):\n        class_name = self.request.get('class_name')\n        if not class_name:\n            self.response.out.write(\"Error: No class name provided.\")\n            return\n        \n        # Dynamically retrieve the class using globals()\n        try:\n            cls = globals()[class_name]\n        except KeyError:\n            self.response.out.write(f\"Error: Class '{class_name}' not found.\")\n            return\n\n        # Validate if the class has the 'all' method\n        if not hasattr(cls, 'all'):\n            self.response.out.write(f\"Error: Class '{class_name}' does not have an 'all' method.\")\n            return\n\n        self.test_retrieval_of_class(cls)\n    \n    def test_retrieval_of_class(self, cls):\n        commandValidated = True \n        beginTime = time()\n        \n        # Fetch data using the provided class\n        itemList = cls.all().fetch(1000) \n\n        for item in itemList: \n            pass \n        \n        endTime = time()\n        self.response.out.write(\"<br/>\" + cls.__name__ + \" count=\" + str(len(itemList)) + \n             \" Duration=\" + self.duration(beginTime, endTime)) \n\n    def duration(self, beginTime, endTime):\n        # Assuming this is a helper method for calculating duration\n        return str(endTime - beginTime)\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **get Method**: \n   - Retrieves the class name from the request parameters.\n   - Uses `globals()` to dynamically fetch the class based on the string name provided. This assumes that the class is defined in the global scope.\n   - Checks if the class has the `all` method, which is required to fetch data.\n\n2. **test_retrieval_of_class Method**:\n   - Takes the class as an argument and performs data retrieval in a generic manner.\n   - Measures the time taken to fetch and iterate over the records.\n\n3. **duration Method**: \n   - A simple helper method to calculate the time taken for the operation.\n\nMake sure the class names are properly handled and match those available in your environment. Also, ensure that the `cls.all()` method exists and works as expected for the classes you're dealing with."
