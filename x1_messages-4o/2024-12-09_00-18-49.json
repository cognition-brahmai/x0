For example, I have folders with names like \"John Smith\", \"Fred Jones\", and \"Ben Jack Martin\", and I want to change them to \"Smith, John\", \"Jones, Fred\", and \"Martin, Ben Jack\". I've tried using os.rename, but struggled with the varying name lengths and inserting the comma. Moreover, some of the folder names are already in the correct form, so I need to skip these during the renaming process. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "Renaming multiple folders in Python while handling varying name lengths and inserting a comma involves parsing each folder name, rearranging the order of words, and checking if the name is already in the desired format. You can use the `os` module to achieve this. Here's a step-by-step guide and a sample script to help you:\n\n1. **Import necessary modules**: You'll need `os` for renaming and navigating directories.\n\n2. **Iterate through the folder names**: Use `os.listdir()` to get a list of all folders in the directory.\n\n3. **Check the current format**: Split the folder name by spaces and check if it's already in the desired format.\n\n4. **Reorder and rename**: If not in the correct format, rearrange the words and use `os.rename()` to rename the folder.\n\nHere is a script that implements these steps:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef rename_folders(directory):\n    for folder_name in os.listdir(directory):\n        folder_path = os.path.join(directory, folder_name)\n        \n        # Ensure it's a directory\n        if os.path.isdir(folder_path):\n            # Split the folder name into parts\n            parts = folder_name.split()\n            \n            # Skip if already in \"Last, First\" format\n            if len(parts) > 1 and ',' not in parts[0]:\n                # Rearrange the parts\n                new_name = f\"{parts[-1]}, {' '.join(parts[:-1])}\"\n                \n                # Construct new folder path\n                new_folder_path = os.path.join(directory, new_name)\n                \n                # Rename the folder\n                os.rename(folder_path, new_folder_path)\n                print(f\"Renamed '{folder_name}' to '{new_name}'\")\n            else:\n                print(f\"Skipped '{folder_name}'\")\n\n# Example usage\ndirectory = 'path/to/your/folder'  # Replace with your folder path\nrename_folders(directory)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Line 9-10**: Check if the current item is a directory.\n- **Line 13**: Skip renaming if the folder name already contains a comma, indicating it's in the desired format.\n- **Line 15**: Rearrange the name parts to \"Last, First\".\n- **Line 18**: Rename the folder using `os.rename()`.\n\n### Note:\n- Make sure to replace `'path/to/your/folder'` with the actual path to the directory containing your folders.\n- This script assumes that the last word in the folder name is the last name. You might need to adjust the logic if your naming conventions differ.\n- Always backup your data before running scripts that modify file systems, especially if running on a large set of folders."
