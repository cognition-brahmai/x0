        "content": "The function you've provided, `calculateSavings`, is a straightforward implementation that calculates how much money can be saved if a penny is saved for every dollar earned. The function multiplies the given amount by 0.01, which effectively saves one penny for each dollar.\n\nHere's the function you provided:\n\n```go\nfunc calculateSavings(amount float64) float64 {\n    saved := amount * 0.01\n    return saved\n}\n```\n\nTo use this function, you simply need to call it with the amount of money you have earned, and it will return the amount saved. Here's an example of how you might use this function:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n)\n\nfunc calculateSavings(amount float64) float64 {\n    saved := amount * 0.01\n    return saved\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    earned := 1000.0 // Example amount earned\n    savings := calculateSavings(earned)\n    fmt.Printf(\"If you save a penny for every dollar earned, you will save: $%.2f\\n\", savings)\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, if you earned $1000, the function would calculate that you saved $10.00. You can adjust the `earned` variable to calculate savings for different amounts."
