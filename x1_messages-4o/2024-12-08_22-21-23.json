Next, we have to square the smallest number and cube the largest number. Then, we will add these two values together and divide the sum by the total number of values in the list. Finally, we will take the square root of the resulting value to find the mean. \nHow can we write the R code to solve this puzzle and display the resulting mean?"

Here's how you can write the R code to achieve that:\n\n```r\n# Given list of numbers\nnumbers <- c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)\n\n# Step 1: Rearrange the numbers in ascending order\nsorted_numbers <- sort(numbers)\n\n# Step 2: Square the smallest number and cube the largest number\nsmallest_squared <- sorted_numbers[1]^2\nlargest_cubed <- sorted_numbers[length(sorted_numbers)]^3\n\n# Step 3: Add these two values together\nsum_values <- smallest_squared + largest_cubed\n\n# Step 4: Divide the sum by the total number of values in the list\naverage_value <- sum_values / length(numbers)\n\n# Step 5: Take the square root of the resulting value to find the mean\nresulting_mean <- sqrt(average_value)\n\n# Display the resulting mean\nprint(resulting_mean)\n```\n\nThis code will perform each of the specified operations step-by-step, and then output the final mean value as per your puzzle's instructions."
