The following is the code that I am using, followed by the output from starting the app and going to \"/\". Am I doing something wrong?\n\nCode:\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\nimport logging\nfrom logging import Formatter, FileHandler\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef hello_world():\n    app.logger.debug('second test message...')\n    return 'Hello World!'\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    #Setup the logger\n    file_handler = FileHandler('output.log')\n    handler = logging.StreamHandler()\n    file_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n    handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n    file_handler.setFormatter(Formatter(\n        '%(asctime)s %(levelname)s: %(message)s '\n        '[in %(pathname)s:%(lineno)d]'\n     ))\n     handler.setFormatter(Formatter(\n        '%(asctime)s %(levelname)s: %(message)s '\n        '[in %(pathname)s:%(lineno)d]'\n     ))\n     app.logger.addHandler(handler)\n     app.logger.addHandler(file_handler)\n     app.logger.error('first test message...')\n     app.run()\n```\n\nOutput:\n```shell\n2015-03-08 11:33:27,183 ERROR: first test message...

        "content": "There are a few issues in your code that can lead to the problems you're experiencing:\n\n1. **FileHandler not writing to the file**: Ensure that the directory where you're trying to create `output.log` is writable. If the script doesn't have permission to write to the directory, the log file won't be created.\n\n2. **Handlers not working correctly**: You forgot to set the logging level for the application's logger, which might be why you're only seeing the first message. Also, you should ensure that the logger's level is set to `DEBUG` so that all messages are captured.\n\n3. **Indentation of `handler.setFormatter`**: Ensure that the indentation is consistent and correct. The formatting setup for both handlers should be at the same indentation level.\n\nHere's a modified version of your code with these considerations:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask\nimport logging\nfrom logging import Formatter, FileHandler, StreamHandler\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef hello_world():\n    app.logger.debug('second test message...')\n    return 'Hello World!'\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Setup the logger\n    app.logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)  # Set the logger level\n\n    file_handler = FileHandler('output.log')\n    file_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n    file_handler.setFormatter(Formatter(\n        '%(asctime)s %(levelname)s: %(message)s '\n        '[in %(pathname)s:%(lineno)d]'\n    ))\n\n    stream_handler = StreamHandler()\n    stream_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n    stream_handler.setFormatter(Formatter(\n        '%(asctime)s %(levelname)s: %(message)s '\n        '[in %(pathname)s:%(lineno)d]'\n    ))\n\n    app.logger.addHandler(file_handler)\n    app.logger.addHandler(stream_handler)\n\n    app.logger.error('first test message...')\n    app.run()\n```\n\n**Check the following:**\n- Ensure that the `output.log` is created in the directory from which you're running the script.\n- Ensure that your environment has write permissions to the directory.\n- Make sure there's no typo in the filename or path.\n\nWith these adjustments, your logging should write to both the file and stdout, and both messages should appear as expected."
