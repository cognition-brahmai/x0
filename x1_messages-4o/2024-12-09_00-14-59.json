        "content": "Yes, there are several implementations of WebSocket clients in Python that you can use. One of the most popular libraries for this purpose is `websocket-client`. This library provides a simple way to interact with WebSocket servers and can be easily installed and used in your Python projects.\n\nHere's a basic example of how you can use the `websocket-client` library to implement a WebSocket client:\n\n1. **Installation:**\n\n   You can install the `websocket-client` library using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install websocket-client\n   ```\n\n2. **Usage:**\n\n   Here's a simple example of a WebSocket client:\n\n   ```python\n   import websocket\n\n   def on_message(ws, message):\n       print(f\"Received message: {message}\")\n\n   def on_error(ws, error):\n       print(f\"Encountered error: {error}\")\n\n   def on_close(ws, close_status_code, close_msg):\n       print(\"Connection closed\")\n\n   def on_open(ws):\n       print(\"Connection opened\")\n       ws.send(\"Hello, WebSocket server!\")\n\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       websocket.enableTrace(True)\n       ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(\"ws://your.websocket.server/url\",\n                                   on_open=on_open,\n                                   on_message=on_message,\n                                   on_error=on_error,\n                                   on_close=on_close)\n\n       ws.run_forever()\n   ```\n\n   In this example, replace `\"ws://your.websocket.server/url\"` with the URL of your WebSocket server. The `on_open`, `on_message`, `on_error`, and `on_close` functions handle the respective WebSocket events.\n\nThis should be a good starting point for implementing a WebSocket client in Python. You can customize the event handlers to suit your specific needs, such as sending commands received from XMPP to your WebSocket server."
