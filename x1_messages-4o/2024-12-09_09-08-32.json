        "content": "Sure, I'd be happy to help with that. To include an `ORDER BY` clause in your SQL query, you'll need to specify the column or columns by which you want to sort the result set. You can order the results in ascending order with `ASC` (which is the default) or in descending order with `DESC`.\n\nHere's a basic example of how you can modify a simple `SELECT` query to include an `ORDER BY` clause:\n\n```sql\nSELECT column1, column2, column3\nFROM your_table\nORDER BY column1 ASC;  -- or DESC for descending order\n```\n\nIf you want to order by more than one column, you can list them separated by commas:\n\n```sql\nSELECT column1, column2, column3\nFROM your_table\nORDER BY column1 ASC, column2 DESC;\n```\n\nThis query will sort the results first by `column1` in ascending order, and then by `column2` in descending order for rows that have the same value in `column1`.\n\nIf you provide the original SQL query, I can give more specific guidance on how to apply the `ORDER BY` clause to it."
