However, the program does not delete these directories after use, which is causing low disk space. I attempted to delete them manually but received a \"permission denied\" error. Could you guide me on how to manually delete these temporary directories and also how to modify the Python program to delete the temp directories after use?"

        "content": "To address the issue of manually deleting temporary directories and modifying your Python program to handle temporary directories efficiently, follow these steps:\n\n### Manually Deleting Temporary Directories\n\nIf you're encountering a \"permission denied\" error while trying to delete directories manually, you might need to use `sudo` to gain the necessary permissions. Open a terminal and execute the following command, replacing `/temp/your_temp_directory` with the actual path of the temporary directory you want to delete:\n\n```bash\nsudo rm -rf /temp/your_temp_directory\n```\n\nBe cautious with this command as it forcefully deletes files and directories without any confirmation.\n\n### Modifying the Python Program\n\nTo ensure your Python program deletes temporary directories after use, you can use the `tempfile` module's context management features, which automatically handle cleanup. Here's how you can modify your program:\n\n#### Using `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory`\n\nInstead of `tempfile.mkdtemp`, use `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory`, which provides a context manager that automatically deletes the directory when the block is exited:\n\n```python\nimport tempfile\n\ndef perform_task():\n    with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory(dir='/temp') as temp_dir:\n        print(f\"Temporary directory created at: {temp_dir}\")\n        # Perform your operations using temp_dir\n        # You can create files or subdirectories within temp_dir\n\n    # At this point, the temporary directory and its contents are deleted\n    print(\"Temporary directory deleted.\")\n\nperform_task()\n```\n\n#### Using `shutil.rmtree` for Explicit Cleanup\n\nIf you prefer more control over when the directory is deleted, you can manually delete it using `shutil.rmtree`:\n\n```python\nimport tempfile\nimport shutil\nimport os\n\ndef perform_task():\n    temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp(dir='/temp')\n    print(f\"Temporary directory created at: {temp_dir}\")\n\n    try:\n        # Perform your operations using temp_dir\n        pass  # Replace with your actual operations\n    finally:\n        # Ensure the directory is deleted even if an error occurs\n        shutil.rmtree(temp_dir)\n        print(f\"Temporary directory deleted: {temp_dir}\")\n\nperform_task()\n```\n\n### Summary\n\n- Use `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` for automatic cleanup via context management.\n- Use `shutil.rmtree` for explicit cleanup, ensuring the `finally` block is used to handle exceptions gracefully.\n- Be cautious with manual deletions using `sudo`, as it grants elevated permissions.\n\nThese approaches should help you manage temporary directories more efficiently and prevent disk space issues."
