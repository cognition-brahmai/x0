For instance, consider the following code:\n\n```python\ndic = {'one': '1', 'two': '2'}\nfor k, v in dic.items():\n    print(k, v)\n```\nWhy isn't the following the default behavior of iterating over a dictionary?\n\n```python\nfor k, v in dic:\n    print(k, v)\n```"

        "content": "In Python, dictionaries are designed to be flexible and efficient. The primary reason you need to use the `items()` method to iterate over key-value pairs is due to how dictionaries are structured and the need for clear, explicit operations.\n\n1. **Explicit is better than implicit**: Python follows the philosophy of \"Explicit is better than implicit,\" as per the Zen of Python. By using `items()`, it is explicit that you are iterating over both keys and values, which makes the code more readable and understandable. It clearly signals the programmer's intention to work with both parts of the dictionary entry.\n\n2. **Backward compatibility**: In earlier versions of Python (prior to Python 3), iterating over a dictionary directly would iterate over the keys by default. Maintaining this consistency helps ensure backward compatibility and avoids breaking existing code.\n\n3. **Efficiency and clarity**: Using `items()` is efficient because it returns a view object that displays a list of a dictionary's key-value tuple pairs. It is a clear and concise way to access both keys and values simultaneously without additional overhead or complexity.\n\n4. **Flexibility**: By default, iterating over a dictionary iterates over its keys. This is often what you want since keys are unique, and you might not always need the associated values. The ability to explicitly choose whether to iterate over keys, values, or key-value pairs (`keys()`, `values()`, or `items()`) provides flexibility for different use cases.\n\nThus, using `dic.items()` is a design choice that aligns with Python's principles, ensuring clarity, consistency, and flexibility when working with dictionaries."
