Below is the code I have used, which I copied from various working Dockerfiles:\n\n```docker\nFROM ubuntu\nMAINTAINER Luke Crooks \"luke@pumalo.org\"\n\n# Update aptitude with new repo\nRUN apt-get update\n\n# Install software \nRUN apt-get install -y git python-virtualenv\n\n# Make ssh dir\nRUN mkdir /root/.ssh/\n\n# Copy over private key, and set permissions\nADD id_rsa /root/.ssh/id_rsa\nRUN chmod 700 /root/.ssh/id_rsa\nRUN chown -R root:root /root/.ssh\n\n# Create known_hosts\nRUN touch /root/.ssh/known_hosts\n\n# Remove host checking\nRUN echo \"Host bitbucket.org\\n\\tStrictHostKeyChecking no\\n\" &gt;&gt; /root/.ssh/config\n\n# Clone the conf files into the docker container\nRUN git clone git@bitbucket.org:Pumalo/docker-conf.git /home/docker-conf\n```\n\nWhen I try to build the Dockerfile, I encounter the following error:\n\n```sh\nStep 10 : RUN git clone git@bitbucket.org:Pumalo/docker-conf.git /home/docker-conf\n ---&gt; Running in 0d244d812a54\nCloning into '/home/docker-conf'...\nWarning: Permanently added 'bitbucket.org,131.103.20.167' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.\nPermission denied (publickey).\nfatal: Could not read from remote repository.\n\nPlease make sure you have the correct access rights\nand the repository exists.\n2014/04/30 16:07:28 The command [/bin/sh -c git clone git@bitbucket.org:Pumalo/docker-conf.git /home/docker-conf] returned a non-zero code: 128\n```\n\nMy `id_rsa` is in the same directory as my Dockerfile and it is a copy of my local key which can clone the repository without any issues. I also tried adding `RUN cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa` to my Dockerfile, and it prints out the correct key. I also tried running `RUN echo \"Host bitbucket.org\\n\\tIdentityFile /root/.ssh/id_rsa\\n\\tStrictHostKeyChecking no\" &gt;&gt; /etc/ssh/ssh_config` as advised, but it didn't help either. This is my first time using Dockerfiles and I can't figure out why this doesn't work. How can I fix this?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is likely related to how Docker handles the build context and the SSH key permissions. Here are several steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n### 1. Ensure Correct Permissions for the SSH Key\n\nThe permissions for the SSH key must be set correctly both on the host and within the Docker container. Ensure that the `id_rsa` file on your host system is set to `600`:\n\n```sh\nchmod 600 id_rsa\n```\n\n### 2. Use SSH Agent Forwarding\n\nOne way to handle SSH keys in Docker is by using SSH agent forwarding. This method allows you to use your SSH keys without copying them into the Docker image, which is more secure. Here\u2019s how you can set it up:\n\n- **Install and set up SSH agent on your host:**\n\n  ```sh\n  eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\n  ssh-add /path/to/your/id_rsa\n  ```\n\n- **Modify your Dockerfile to use SSH agent forwarding:**\n\n  Instead of copying the SSH key into the image, modify your Dockerfile to use SSH agent forwarding by using a multi-stage build or by running the clone command directly in your Docker run command:\n\n  ```dockerfile\n  FROM ubuntu\n\n  # Update aptitude with new repo\n  RUN apt-get update\n\n  # Install software \n  RUN apt-get install -y git openssh-client\n\n  # Make sure the known_hosts file exists\n  RUN mkdir -p /root/.ssh && touch /root/.ssh/known_hosts\n\n  # Add bitbucket.org to known_hosts\n  RUN ssh-keyscan bitbucket.org >> /root/.ssh/known_hosts\n\n  # You can now clone the repository using the forwarded SSH agent\n  ```\n\n- **Build your Docker image with SSH agent forwarding:**\n\n  Use `docker build` with a build argument to forward the SSH agent socket:\n\n  ```sh\n  docker build --ssh default .\n  ```\n\n  This requires Docker version 18.09 or later, and your Docker daemon must be configured to support BuildKit.\n\n### 3. Use HTTPS Clone URL\n\nAnother approach is to use the HTTPS clone URL with a personal access token (PAT) if Bitbucket supports that. This avoids the need to handle SSH keys entirely:\n\n- Generate a personal access token in Bitbucket with the necessary permissions.\n- Modify your Dockerfile to use the HTTPS URL:\n\n  ```dockerfile\n  FROM ubuntu\n\n  # Update aptitude with new repo\n  RUN apt-get update\n\n  # Install software\n  RUN apt-get install -y git\n\n  # Clone the repository using HTTPS and PAT\n  RUN git clone https://username:token@bitbucket.org/Pumalo/docker-conf.git /home/docker-conf\n  ```\n\nReplace `username` with your Bitbucket username and `token` with your generated personal access token.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to clone your private repository within a Docker container successfully."
