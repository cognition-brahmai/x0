I have noticed these options and used `on_delete=models.CASCADE` before, which removes all related entries when I remove the parent entry. However, I'm unsure if both of these options perform the same function, and didn't find any detailed explanation in Django 2.0 documentation."

        "content": "In Django models, the `on_delete` parameter is used to specify the behavior of foreign key relationships when the referenced object is deleted. The options `models.PROTECT` and `models.CASCADE` serve different purposes:\n\n1. **`on_delete=models.CASCADE`:**\n   - This option is used to ensure that when a referenced object (i.e., the parent object) is deleted, all objects that have a foreign key pointing to it (i.e., the child objects) are also deleted. This is useful for maintaining referential integrity by automatically removing related data that would otherwise become orphaned.\n   - Example: If you have a `Blog` model with a foreign key to `Author`, and `on_delete=models.CASCADE` is set, deleting an `Author` instance will also delete all `Blog` instances related to that author.\n\n2. **`on_delete=models.PROTECT`:**\n   - This option prevents the deletion of the referenced object if there are any objects pointing to it. In other words, it raises a `ProtectedError` when you try to delete the parent object, thus protecting it from being removed if it still has any related child objects.\n   - Example: Using the same `Blog` and `Author` models, if `on_delete=models.PROTECT` is set, attempting to delete an `Author` instance that has related `Blog` instances will result in an error, preventing the deletion.\n\nIn summary, `models.CASCADE` automatically deletes related objects, while `models.PROTECT` prevents deletion if there are related objects, ensuring that data integrity is maintained according to the specified behavior. Your choice between the two should depend on the specific requirements of your application and how you want to handle related data when a parent object is deleted."
