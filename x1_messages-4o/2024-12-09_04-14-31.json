For instance, if my input list is L = [['a','b','c'],['b','d','e'],['k'],['o','p'],['e','f'],['p','a'],['d','g']], I want to merge all lists that have at least one common element, and repeat this procedure until there are no more lists that share an element. The expected output for this input would be L = [['a','b','c','d','e','f','g','o','p'],['k']]."

        "content": "To merge lists within a list that share common elements, you can follow an iterative approach by repeatedly merging lists until no further merges can be made. Here is a step-by-step solution in Python:\n\n```python\ndef merge_lists(input_list):\n    # Use a while loop to keep merging until no more merges can be done\n    merged = True\n    while merged:\n        merged = False\n        result = []\n        while input_list:\n            # Take the first sublist\n            first, *rest = input_list\n            first = set(first)\n\n            # Find all sublists that have a common element with the first sublist\n            lf = len(rest)\n            rest2 = []\n            for r in rest:\n                if first.intersection(set(r)):\n                    first |= set(r)\n                    merged = True\n                else:\n                    rest2.append(r)\n            input_list = rest2\n\n            # Add the merged sublist to the result\n            result.append(list(first))\n\n        input_list = result\n    return input_list\n\n# Example usage\nL = [['a','b','c'],['b','d','e'],['k'],['o','p'],['e','f'],['p','a'],['d','g']]\nmerged_list = merge_lists(L)\nprint(merged_list)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialize a `merged` flag**: Start with a flag `merged` set to `True` to enter the loop.\n\n2. **Use a while loop**: Continue the loop as long as any merge operation is performed in the previous iteration.\n\n3. **Iterate through the list**: For each sublist, compare it with the rest of the sublists in the list to find common elements.\n\n4. **Merge sublists with common elements**: If any sublist shares elements with the current sublist, merge them by taking the union of their elements.\n\n5. **Update the `merged` flag**: Set `merged` to `True` if any merge operation is performed.\n\n6. **Repeat**: Once no more merges can be performed, the loop exits and the final merged list is returned.\n\nThis approach ensures that all lists with common elements are merged into a single list. The result for the given example would be:\n\n```\n[['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'o', 'p'], ['k']]\n```\n\nThis implementation efficiently merges sublists with shared elements by utilizing set operations."
