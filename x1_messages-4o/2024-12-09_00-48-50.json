        "content": "In Python, there isn't a direct way to \"unimport\" a module like you might expect from the term. However, you can effectively remove the reference to the module from your namespace and suggest that the memory be freed up by using the `del` statement and the `sys.modules` dictionary. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Remove the variable reference**: You can delete the reference to the `numpy` module that you have in your namespace by using `del`.\n\n2. **Remove the module entry from `sys.modules`**: This will effectively remove the module from the system module registry, suggesting that it be garbage collected if no other references exist.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport sys \nimport numpy as np \n\n# Example usage\n# doMe()\n# np.something()\n\n# Remove the reference to numpy\ndel np\n\n# Remove the module from sys.modules\nif 'numpy' in sys.modules:\n    del sys.modules['numpy']\n\n# At this point, numpy should be eligible for garbage collection, provided no other references exist.\n```\n\nKeep in mind that removing a module like this is not commonly done and might not be necessary in typical use cases. Also, if there are other parts of your program or other modules that still hold references to `numpy`, it won't be completely removed from memory until those references are also deleted."
