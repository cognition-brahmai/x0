For example, given the list ['aet2000','ppt2000', 'aet2001', 'ppt2001'], I want to filter by the string 'aet' and get ['aet2000','aet2001']. However, when I try to apply this to my actual data, I encounter a TypeError: 'argument of type 'int' is not iterable'. Here is the code I used to generate the list of file names:\n\n```python\nyears = range(2000,2011)\nmonths = [\"jan\",\"feb\",\"mar\",\"apr\",\"may\",\"jun\",\"jul\",\"aug\",\"sep\",\"oct\",\"nov\",\"dec\"]\nvariables = [\"cwd\",\"ppt\",\"aet\",\"pet\",\"tmn\",\"tmx\"]     \ntifnames = list(range(0,(len(years)*len(months)*len(variables)+1)  ))\ni = 0\nfor variable in variables:\n   for year in years:\n      for month in months:\n         fullname = str(variable)+str(year)+str(month)+\".tif\"\n         tifnames[i] = fullname\n         i = i+1 \n```\nWhen I try to filter this list, I receive the error:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<pyshell#89>\", line 1, in <module>\n    func(tifnames,'aet')\n  File \"<pyshell#88>\", line 2, in func\n    return [i for i in l if s in i]\nTypeError: argument of type 'int' is not iterable\n```\nDespite the fact that tifnames is a list of character strings. Can anyone help me understand what's going wrong and how to filter my list correctly?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that the `tifnames` list is not fully composed of strings. The issue arises from the initial creation of `tifnames` using `list(range(...))`, which initializes the list with integers. Since you're filling this list with strings later, the list might still contain some integers if the loop doesn't fill the entire list.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you should initialize `tifnames` as an empty list and then append the strings to it. Here\u2019s how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nyears = range(2000, 2011)\nmonths = [\"jan\", \"feb\", \"mar\", \"apr\", \"may\", \"jun\", \"jul\", \"aug\", \"sep\", \"oct\", \"nov\", \"dec\"]\nvariables = [\"cwd\", \"ppt\", \"aet\", \"pet\", \"tmn\", \"tmx\"]\ntifnames = []  # Initialize an empty list\n\nfor variable in variables:\n    for year in years:\n        for month in months:\n            fullname = f\"{variable}{year}{month}.tif\"\n            tifnames.append(fullname)\n\n# Now filter the list for a specific substring\ndef filter_by_substring(l, s):\n    return [i for i in l if s in i]\n\n# Example usage\nfiltered_tifnames = filter_by_substring(tifnames, 'aet')\nprint(filtered_tifnames)\n```\n\nThis should work without raising the `TypeError` and will correctly filter `tifnames` to include only those strings that contain the specified substring."
