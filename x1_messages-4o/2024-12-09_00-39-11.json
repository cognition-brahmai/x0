How can I change the legend background color when using seaborn for my plots? Here is the code I have been using:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\na = np.random.rand(10,1)\n\nplt.plot(a, label='label')\nlegend = plt.legend()\nframe = legend.get_frame()\nframe.set_facecolor('green')\nplt.show()\n\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nplt.plot(a, label='label')\nlegend = plt.legend()\nframe = legend.get_frame()\nframe.set_facecolor('green')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThe first part of the code works as expected and changes the legend background to green. However, when I use seaborn in the second part, the background remains white."

        "content": "When using Seaborn, it builds on top of Matplotlib, so the approach to changing the legend background color should be consistent. However, Seaborn often modifies the default matplotlib settings, which might affect your code. To ensure that the legend background color is changed when using Seaborn, you can explicitly define the legend properties after plotting your data. Here's how you can modify your code to work with Seaborn:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Generate random data\na = np.random.rand(10, 1)\n\n# Plot using Seaborn\nsns.set()  # Optional: Set Seaborn's default style\nplt.plot(a, label='label')\n\n# Get the legend\nlegend = plt.legend()\n\n# Change the background color of the legend\nframe = legend.get_frame()\nframe.set_facecolor('green')  # Set the desired color\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this modified code, we explicitly set the legend after plotting with Seaborn to ensure the background color is changed accordingly. The `sns.set()` line is optional and sets Seaborn's default style, which you might be using unintentionally if you import Seaborn. If you still encounter issues, make sure that the Seaborn settings or styles are not overriding your Matplotlib settings."
