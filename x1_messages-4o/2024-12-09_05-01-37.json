        "content": "The issue you're experiencing with relative imports is common, especially when working with scripts in different directories. Here's how you can resolve it:\n\n### Absolute Import\n\n1. **Ensure Correct File Structure**: If `test.py` and `config.py` are in the same directory, the directory should be treated as a package. Make sure there's an `__init__.py` file in that directory, but note that this is not strictly necessary in Python 3.3 and above.\n\n2. **Run as a Module**: You can run `test.py` as a module instead of a script. This approach requires you to execute the script from the parent directory. For instance, if both files are in a directory called `my_package`, navigate to the parent directory of `my_package` and run:\n   ```bash\n   python -m my_package.test\n   ```\n\n3. **Check Your PYTHONPATH**: Ensure that the directory containing your scripts is on your PYTHONPATH, or that you are executing your script from the directory containing both files.\n\n### Relative Import\n\nRelative imports work only within a package setup. Ensure that:\n\n1. **Directory Structure**: Both `test.py` and `config.py` should be in the same package, and you should have an `__init__.py` file if needed for older Python versions.\n\n2. **Running as a Script**: You cannot run `test.py` as a standalone script if it uses a relative import. Instead, run it as a module:\n   ```bash\n   python -m my_package.test\n   ```\n\n3. **Correct Usage**: Ensure the relative import in `test.py` is correct:\n   ```python\n   from . import config\n   ```\n\n### Example Directory Structure\n\n```\n/project\n    /my_package\n        __init__.py\n        config.py\n        test.py\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n- **Check for Typos**: Ensure there are no typos in filenames or import statements.\n- **Correct Python Path**: Make sure you're running your script from the right location, or set the PYTHONPATH to include the directory where your package resides.\n- **Module vs. Script**: Use the `-m` flag to run your scripts as modules from the parent directory.\n\nFollowing these steps should help you resolve the import issues in your Python project."
