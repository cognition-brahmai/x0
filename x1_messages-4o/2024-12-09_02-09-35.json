On the other hand, `request.form.get('comp_select')` is returning a blank list \"[]\". Can anyone help me understand where I'm going wrong?\n\nMy HTML code is as follows:\n\n```html\n<form class=\"form-inline\" action=\"{{ url_for('test') }}\">\n  <div class=\"form-group\">\n    <div class=\"input-group\">\n        <span class=\"input-group-addon\">Please select</span>\n            <select name=\"comp_select\" class=\"selectpicker form-control\">\n              {% for o in data %}\n              <option value=\"{{ o.name }}\">{{ o.name }}</option>\n              {% endfor %}                                              \n            </select>\n    </div>\n    <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-default\">Go</button>\n  </div>\n</form>\n```\n\nAnd my Python Flask code is :\n\n```python\n@app.route(\"/test\" , methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef test():\n    select = request.form.get('comp_select')\n    return(str(select)) # just to see what select is\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the form submission method being incorrect. In your HTML form, you have specified the `action` attribute, but you haven't specified the `method` attribute. By default, forms use the `GET` method if not specified, which means the form data will be appended to the URL as query parameters. However, in your Flask route, you're trying to access the form data using `request.form`, which works for `POST` requests, not `GET`.\n\nHere's how you can fix this issue:\n\n1. **Specify the Method in Your Form:**\n\n   Add the `method=\"post\"` attribute to your `<form>` tag to ensure that the form data is sent as a POST request.\n\n   ```html\n   <form class=\"form-inline\" action=\"{{ url_for('test') }}\" method=\"post\">\n   ```\n\n2. **Ensure You Are Using the Correct Method in Your Route:**\n\n   Since you're using `request.form` to retrieve data, make sure your form is set to use the `POST` method as shown above. Your Flask route is already set to handle both `GET` and `POST` methods.\n\n3. **Check the Server Logs:**\n\n   If you continue to experience issues, check your server logs for any errors or warnings that might provide more context on what's going wrong.\n\nBy making these adjustments, your form should correctly send the selected option from the `<select>` element to the `/test` route via POST, and the value should be retrievable using `request.form.get('comp_select')`.\n\nHere's the updated HTML form:\n\n```html\n<form class=\"form-inline\" action=\"{{ url_for('test') }}\" method=\"post\">\n  <div class=\"form-group\">\n    <div class=\"input-group\">\n      <span class=\"input-group-addon\">Please select</span>\n      <select name=\"comp_select\" class=\"selectpicker form-control\">\n        {% for o in data %}\n        <option value=\"{{ o.name }}\">{{ o.name }}</option>\n        {% endfor %}                                              \n      </select>\n    </div>\n    <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-default\">Go</button>\n  </div>\n</form>\n```\n\nWith this setup, your Flask route should now correctly receive and display the value selected from the dropdown."
