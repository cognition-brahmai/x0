The function that downloads the image and saves it locally is currently run inline with the code that displays a message to the user. However, this process can take over 10 seconds for non-local images. Is there a way to call this function when it's needed but have it run in the background while the code continues executing? Ideally, I would like to use a default image until the correct one becomes available."

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this by using Python's threading or asynchronous capabilities. By downloading the images in the background, your main program can continue executing without waiting for the download to complete. Here, I'll provide you with an example using both threading and asynchronous programming with `asyncio`.\n\n### Using Threading\n\nYou can use Python's `threading` module to run the download function in a separate thread. Here's a basic example:\n\n```python\nimport threading\nimport time\nimport urllib.request\nfrom PIL import Image\n\ndef download_image(url, filename):\n    try:\n        urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, filename)\n        print(f\"Image downloaded: {filename}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error downloading image: {e}\")\n\ndef display_image(image_path):\n    try:\n        with Image.open(image_path) as img:\n            img.show()\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error displaying image: {e}\")\n\ndef main():\n    image_url = \"http://example.com/large_image.jpg\"\n    local_filename = \"downloaded_image.jpg\"\n    default_image = \"default_image.jpg\"\n    \n    # Start the image download in a separate thread\n    download_thread = threading.Thread(target=download_image, args=(image_url, local_filename))\n    download_thread.start()\n    \n    # Display the default image while the download is in progress\n    display_image(default_image)\n    \n    # Wait for the download to complete\n    download_thread.join()\n    \n    # Display the downloaded image\n    display_image(local_filename)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Using Asyncio\n\nIf you're comfortable with asynchronous programming, `asyncio` can be a powerful tool:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport aiohttp\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport aiofiles\n\nasync def download_image(url, filename):\n    try:\n        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n            async with session.get(url) as response:\n                if response.status == 200:\n                    f = await aiofiles.open(filename, mode='wb')\n                    await f.write(await response.read())\n                    await f.close()\n                    print(f\"Image downloaded: {filename}\")\n                else:\n                    print(f\"Failed to download image. Status code: {response.status}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error downloading image: {e}\")\n\ndef display_image(image_path):\n    try:\n        with Image.open(image_path) as img:\n            img.show()\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error displaying image: {e}\")\n\nasync def main():\n    image_url = \"http://example.com/large_image.jpg\"\n    local_filename = \"downloaded_image.jpg\"\n    default_image = \"default_image.jpg\"\n    \n    # Start the image download as an asynchronous task\n    download_task = asyncio.create_task(download_image(image_url, local_filename))\n    \n    # Display the default image while the download is in progress\n    display_image(default_image)\n    \n    # Wait for the download to complete\n    await download_task\n    \n    # Display the downloaded image\n    display_image(local_filename)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    asyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nIn both examples, the program starts downloading the image in the background while displaying a default image. Once the download is complete, it replaces the default image with the downloaded one. Choose the method that best fits your application and coding style."
