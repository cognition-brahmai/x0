Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\na = [49, 51, 53, 56]\nvalue_to_subtract = 13\n\n# Subtract 13 from each element in the list\nresult = [x - value_to_subtract for x in a]\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n\n```\n[36, 38, 40, 43]\n```\n\nIn this example, each element in the list `a` is iterated over, and 13 is subtracted from it, creating a new list `result` with the modified values."
