I'm expecting this to be caught by assertRaises, but it's not working as expected. Here's the code I'm running:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\n\nclass IsOne(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n    def is_one(self, i):\n        if (i != 1):\n            raise ValueError\n\nclass IsOne_test(unittest.TestCase):\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        self.isone = IsOne()\n\n    def test_good(self):\n        self.isone.is_one(1)\n        self.assertTrue(True)\n\n    def test_bad(self):\n        self.assertRaises(ValueError, self.isone.is_one(2))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\nThe output of the unit-test is as follows:\n\n```\n======================================================================\nERROR: test_bad (__main__.IsOne_test)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"test/raises.py\", line 20, in test_bad\n    self.assertRaises(ValueError, self.isone.is_one(2))\n  File \"test/raises.py\", line 8, in is_one\n    raise ValueError\nValueError\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nRan 2 tests in 0.008s\n\nFAILED (errors=1)\n```\n\nWhy is the ValueError not being caught by assertRaises in the test_bad method?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is due to the way `assertRaises` is being used in your `test_bad` method. The `assertRaises` method is designed to be used either as a context manager or by passing the callable and its arguments separately. In your code, you are calling the method directly, which means the exception is raised before `assertRaises` has a chance to handle it.\n\nHere is how you can fix the `test_bad` method to properly use `assertRaises`:\n\n### Using `assertRaises` as a context manager:\n```python\ndef test_bad(self):\n    with self.assertRaises(ValueError):\n        self.isone.is_one(2)\n```\n\n### Using `assertRaises` with arguments:\n```python\ndef test_bad(self):\n    self.assertRaises(ValueError, self.isone.is_one, 2)\n```\n\nBoth approaches will correctly catch the `ValueError` exception raised by the `is_one` method when `i` is not equal to 1. The first approach uses a `with` statement to create a context where the exception is expected, while the second approach passes the callable and its arguments to `assertRaises`.\n\nChoose one of these methods to modify your `test_bad` method, and the test should pass as expected."
