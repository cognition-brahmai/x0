To format the numbers in your DataFrame column with commas as thousand separators, you should apply the formatting to each element in the column.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this using the Pandas library:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Example DataFrame\ndata = {'Lead Rev': [100000, 5000, 2500000]}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Formatting the 'Lead Rev' column\ndf['Lead Rev'] = df['Lead Rev'].apply(lambda x: '{:,}'.format(x))\n\nprint(df)\n```\n\nThis code will apply the formatting to each number in the `'Lead Rev'` column, converting them into strings with commas as thousand separators. The `apply` function is used here to apply a lambda function that formats each number individually."
