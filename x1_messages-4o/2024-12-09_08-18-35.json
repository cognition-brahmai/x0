For instance, if I have a list like [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55], I want to unpack it such that I can get the first element as 'head' and the remaining list as 'tail' like this:\n\n```python\nhead, tail = **some_magic applied to** [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]\nhead\n# Output: 1\ntail\n# Output: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]\n```"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this in Python using the unpacking feature with the `*` operator. Here is how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Your list\nnumbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]\n\n# Unpacking the list into head and tail\nhead, *tail = numbers\n\n# Output the results\nprint(\"head:\", head)  # Output: 1\nprint(\"tail:\", tail)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]\n```\n\nIn this code, `head` will get the first element of the list, and `*tail` will gather the remaining elements into a list named `tail`. This is a very Pythonic way to achieve the unpacking of a list into a head and tail."
