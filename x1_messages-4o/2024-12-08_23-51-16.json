Below is an example of a structured 5-paragraph essay on the topic of climate change formatted using HTML:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Climate Change: A Global Challenge</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n    <h1>Climate Change: A Global Challenge</h1>\n    <p>\n        Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing our planet today. It refers to long-term changes in temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions. These changes are primarily driven by human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases. This essay explores the impact of climate change, the role of human activities, and the importance of global cooperation in addressing this critical issue.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>The Impact of Climate Change</h2>\n    <p>\n        The effects of climate change are already evident around the world. Rising temperatures have led to more frequent and severe weather events, such as hurricanes, droughts, and floods. These phenomena not only cause destruction but also threaten food security and water resources. Additionally, melting ice caps and rising sea levels pose a significant risk to coastal communities, potentially displacing millions of people.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>The Role of Human Activities</h2>\n    <p>\n        Human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, are the primary contributors to climate change. The release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere has been linked to industrial processes, deforestation, and transportation. These activities increase the greenhouse effect, trapping heat and leading to global warming. Reducing emissions is crucial to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>The Importance of Global Cooperation</h2>\n    <p>\n        Addressing climate change requires a concerted effort from all nations. International agreements, such as the Paris Agreement, aim to unite countries in the fight against climate change by setting targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Collaboration in research, technology exchange, and funding for sustainable development initiatives are essential to create a comprehensive approach to tackling climate change globally.\n    </p>\n\n    <h3>Conclusion</h3>\n    <p>\n        In conclusion, climate change presents a formidable challenge that demands immediate attention and action. The impacts are widespread, affecting the environment, economies, and societies. While human activities significantly contribute to the problem, they also hold the key to its solution. Through global cooperation and commitment to sustainable practices, we can work towards a healthier planet and a more secure future for generations to come.\n    </p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis HTML document provides a structured 5-paragraph essay on climate change, with headings and subheadings to clearly delineate the introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion."
