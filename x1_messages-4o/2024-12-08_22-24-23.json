A ball is thrown upwards from a height of 1 meter with an initial velocity of 10 meters per second.

        "content": "To find the maximum height the ball will reach and the time it takes to get there, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Maximum Height\n\nThe formula for the height of the ball as a function of time is given by:\n\n\\[ h(t) = v_i \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot g \\cdot t^2 + h_0 \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( v_i = 10 \\, \\text{m/s} \\) (initial velocity),\n- \\( g = 9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2 \\) (acceleration due to gravity),\n- \\( h_0 = 1 \\, \\text{m} \\) (initial height).\n\nThe ball reaches its maximum height when its velocity is zero. The velocity as a function of time is given by:\n\n\\[ v(t) = v_i - g \\cdot t \\]\n\nSetting \\( v(t) = 0 \\) to find the time when the velocity is zero:\n\n\\[ 0 = 10 - 9.8 \\cdot t \\]\n\nSolving for \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{10}{9.8} \\approx 1.02 \\, \\text{seconds} \\]\n\nNow, substitute this time back into the height equation to find the maximum height:\n\n\\[ h(1.02) = 10 \\cdot 1.02 - \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 9.8 \\cdot (1.02)^2 + 1 \\]\n\n\\[ h(1.02) = 10.2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 9.8 \\cdot 1.0404 + 1 \\]\n\n\\[ h(1.02) = 10.2 - 5.09796 + 1 \\]\n\n\\[ h(1.02) = 6.10204 \\, \\text{meters} \\]\n\nSo, the maximum height the ball reaches is approximately 6.1 meters.\n\n### Time to Hit the Ground\n\nTo find the time it takes for the ball to hit the ground, we set \\( h(t) = 0 \\) and solve for \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ 0 = 10 \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 9.8 \\cdot t^2 + 1 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 0 = -4.9t^2 + 10t + 1 \\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in the form \\( at^2 + bt + c = 0 \\), where:\n- \\( a = -4.9 \\),\n- \\( b = 10 \\),\n- \\( c = 1 \\).\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula to solve for \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{-10 \\pm \\sqrt{10^2 - 4 \\times (-4.9) \\times 1}}{2 \\times (-4.9)} \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{-10 \\pm \\sqrt{100 + 19.6}}{-9.8} \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{-10 \\pm \\sqrt{119.6}}{-9.8} \\]\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{-10 \\pm 10.94}{-9.8} \\]\n\nCalculating the two possible values for \\( t \\):\n\n\\[ t_1 = \\frac{-10 + 10.94}{-9.8} \\approx 0.096 \\, \\text{seconds} \\] (This is when the ball just starts)\n\n\\[ t_2 = \\frac{-10 - 10.94}{-9.8} \\approx 2.24 \\, \\text{seconds} \\]\n\nThe time it takes for the ball to hit the ground is approximately 2.24 seconds."
