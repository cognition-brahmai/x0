I need this to be the default Manager, as I'm also creating a custom tag that retrieves content from any model specified by an argument, and it needs to use the default Manager for that model. However, I'm facing an issue where Django Admin is using this default Manager for this model, which leads to not all model instances being displayed in the admin. Although I've also explicitly added the default Manager as \"objects\", the admin seems to be using the default Manager. How can I specify which Manager should be used by the admin?\n\n```python\nsubset = CustomManager() # the default manager\nobjects = models.Manager() # the one I want admin to use\n```"

        "content": "In Django, the default manager is the first manager defined in a model. However, when you want to use a specific manager for the Django admin, you can override the `get_queryset` method in a custom admin class to specify which manager to use. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Define Your Managers**: Ensure your custom managers are defined properly in your model.\n\n2. **Custom Admin Class**: Create a custom admin class where you override the `get_queryset` method to use the `objects` manager instead of the default one.\n\n3. **Register Your Model with the Custom Admin**: Register your model using the custom admin class.\n\nHere is an example implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib import admin\nfrom .models import YourModel\n\nclass YourModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    def get_queryset(self, request):\n        # Use the 'objects' manager instead of the default manager\n        return YourModel.objects.all()\n\n# Register the model with the custom admin class\nadmin.site.register(YourModel, YourModelAdmin)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`get_queryset` Method**: By overriding this method in the admin class, you're explicitly telling Django to use the `objects` manager when retrieving the queryset for the admin interface.\n\n- **Registering the Admin**: Registering with `YourModelAdmin` ensures that this custom behavior is applied whenever the admin site interacts with `YourModel`.\n\nThis way, while your default manager (`subset`) still handles other operations, the admin site will use the `objects` manager to fetch all instances of your model."
