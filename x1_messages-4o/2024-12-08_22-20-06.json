Here are the scores of the teams:\nTeam 1: 30 points\nTeam 2: 40 points\nTeam 3: 50 points\nTeam 4: 20 points\nPlease provide a C++ code that can calculate the total scores of each team and rank them accordingly."

        "content": "To rank teams based on their total scores using C++, you can utilize a vector of pairs, where each pair consists of the team number and its corresponding score. You can then sort this vector in descending order based on the scores. Here is a simple C++ program to achieve this:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <algorithm>\n\nint main() {\n    // Define a vector of pairs to store team numbers and their scores\n    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> teams = {\n        {1, 30}, // Team 1 with 30 points\n        {2, 40}, // Team 2 with 40 points\n        {3, 50}, // Team 3 with 50 points\n        {4, 20}  // Team 4 with 20 points\n    };\n\n    // Sort the vector in descending order based on the scores\n    std::sort(teams.begin(), teams.end(), [](const std::pair<int, int>& a, const std::pair<int, int>& b) {\n        return a.second > b.second;\n    });\n\n    // Display the ranking\n    std::cout << \"Team Rankings based on Total Scores:\" << std::endl;\n    for (const auto& team : teams) {\n        std::cout << \"Team \" << team.first << \": \" << team.second << \" points\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Vector of Pairs**: The `teams` vector holds pairs of team numbers and their respective scores.\n- **Sorting**: The `std::sort` function is used with a custom comparator lambda function that sorts the pairs by the second element (score) in descending order.\n- **Output**: After sorting, the program outputs the teams ranked from highest to lowest score.\n\nThis simple program will output the teams ranked by their total scores. You can easily add more teams or modify the scores to fit other scenarios."
