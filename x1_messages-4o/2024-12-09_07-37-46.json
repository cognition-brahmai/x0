For instance, an input list of [1,2,3] should return [1, [1,2], [1,3], 2, [2,3], 3, [1,2,3]]. I have come across many solutions using the itertools library, but they return objects when I only need a list."

        "content": "To create a list containing all possible combinations of an input list in Python, you can use the `itertools.combinations` function from the `itertools` library. This function generates combinations of a specified length from the input iterable. Since you want all combinations of any length, you can iterate over different lengths and collect the results. Finally, you can convert the combinations to a list. Here's a code example to achieve that:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef all_combinations(input_list):\n    result = []\n    for r in range(1, len(input_list) + 1):\n        # Generate combinations of length `r`\n        comb = combinations(input_list, r)\n        # Convert each combination to a list and extend the result list\n        result.extend([list(c) for c in comb])\n    return result\n\n# Example usage\ninput_list = [1, 2, 3]\ncombinations_list = all_combinations(input_list)\nprint(combinations_list)\n```\n\nThis code will output:\n\n```\n[[1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]\n```\n\nThe function `all_combinations` iterates over all possible lengths (`r`), generates combinations for each length, converts each combination to a list, and appends it to the result list, which matches your requirement."
