This method seems to be called in a loop. What exactly happens when this method is called? Is it returning a list or a single element? When will the calls to this method stop?\n\nThe code under consideration is:\n\n```python\ndef _get_child_candidates(self, distance, min_dist, max_dist):\n    if self._leftchild and distance - max_dist < self._median:\n        yield self._leftchild\n    if self._rightchild and distance + max_dist >= self._median:\n        yield self._rightchild  \n```\n\nAnd this is the caller:\n\n```python\nresult, candidates = [], [self]\nwhile candidates:\n    node = candidates.pop()\n    distance = node._get_dist(obj)\n    if distance <= max_dist and distance >= min_dist:\n        result.extend(node._values)\n    candidates.extend(node._get_child_candidates(distance, min_dist, max_dist))\nreturn result\n```"

        "content": "The `yield` keyword in Python is used to turn a function into a generator. A generator is a special type of iterator that allows you to iterate over a sequence of values without storing them all in memory at once. When a function contains a `yield` statement, it produces a generator object, which can be used to yield values one at a time and resume execution from the last yield point.\n\nIn the provided code, the function `_get_child_candidates` uses `yield` to produce child nodes one at a time. Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n\n1. **Function as a Generator**: `_get_child_candidates` is a generator function. Instead of returning a single value or a list, it yields values one at a time.\n\n2. **Yielding Values**: In the function `_get_child_candidates`, `yield` is used twice to potentially yield two child nodes, `_leftchild` and `_rightchild`, if they meet the specified conditions. This means that when this function is called, it will not immediately execute all its code. Instead, it will execute until it hits a `yield` statement, return the yielded value, and pause the function's execution.\n\n3. **Iteration**: In the caller code, the line `candidates.extend(node._get_child_candidates(distance, min_dist, max_dist))` uses the generator returned by `_get_child_candidates`. This line converts the generator into a list of yielded values and extends the `candidates` list with these values. Essentially, it adds any yielded child nodes to the `candidates` list.\n\n4. **Loop Execution**: The `while candidates:` loop continues until `candidates` is empty. In each iteration, a node is popped from `candidates`, its distance is calculated, and it checks whether the node's values should be added to the `result` list. Then, `_get_child_candidates` is called to add more nodes to `candidates`.\n\n5. **Stopping Condition**: The loop will stop when there are no more candidates to process, i.e., when `candidates` is empty. The generator function itself controls which child nodes are added to `candidates` based on the given conditions.\n\nIn summary, the use of `yield` allows the `_get_child_candidates` function to produce child nodes one at a time without building a complete list upfront. This can be more memory-efficient, especially when dealing with large data structures. The loop continues to process nodes until there are no more candidates to consider."
