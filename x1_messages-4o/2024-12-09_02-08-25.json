Initially, the command `sudo pip3.4 install psycopg2` was not working and was displaying the error message `Error: pg_config executable not found.` I managed to fix this by using the command `export PATH=/Library/PostgreSQL/9.4/bin/:\"$PATH\u201d`. \n\nAfter that, when I tried to import psycopg2 in my project, I encountered the following ImportError: \n```\nImportError: dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/lib/python3.4/site-packages/psycopg2/_psycopg.so Library libssl.1.0.0.dylib Library libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib\n```\nI fixed this by using the commands: \n\n```\nsudo ln -s /Library/PostgreSQL/9.4/lib/libssl.1.0.0.dylib /usr/lib\nsudo ln -s /Library/PostgreSQL/9.4/lib/libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib /usr/lib\n```\nHowever, now I am getting a new ImportError: \n```\nImportError: dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/lib/python3.4/site-packages/psycopg2/_psycopg.so, 2): Symbol not found: _lo_lseek64 Referenced from: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/lib/python3.4/site-packages/psycopg2/_psycopg.so Expected in: /usr/lib/libpq.5.dylib in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/lib/python3.4/site-packages/psycopg2/_psycopg.so\n```\nCould you please help me solve this problem?"

        "content": "The ImportError you're encountering is likely due to a mismatch between the PostgreSQL client library version used during the compilation of psycopg2 and the version available on your system. Here are some steps to try and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Reinstall psycopg2:**\n   Ensure that you have the latest version of psycopg2 installed. You may need to uninstall the current version and reinstall it.\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo pip3.4 uninstall psycopg2\n   sudo pip3.4 install psycopg2\n   ```\n\n2. **Update PostgreSQL:**\n   Make sure you are using a compatible version of PostgreSQL. If you're using an outdated version, consider updating it. You can download the latest version from [PostgreSQL's official website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).\n\n3. **Recompile psycopg2:**\n   If the above steps don't work, try recompiling psycopg2 with the correct PostgreSQL libraries.\n\n   First, ensure that you have PostgreSQL development files installed:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew install postgresql\n   ```\n\n   Then, set the `pg_config` path correctly:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=/usr/local/opt/postgresql/bin:$PATH\n   ```\n\n   Now, try recompiling psycopg2:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo pip3.4 install --no-binary psycopg2 psycopg2\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for Conflicting Libraries:**\n   Sometimes, other libraries might conflict with the one psycopg2 is trying to use. Make sure there are no conflicting libraries in your `/usr/lib` or `/usr/local/lib` directories.\n\n5. **Use Virtual Environment:**\n   Consider using a virtual environment to manage your Python packages. This can help avoid conflicts with system libraries.\n\n   ```bash\n   python3.4 -m venv myenv\n   source myenv/bin/activate\n   pip install psycopg2\n   ```\n\n   Then, run your Python scripts within this environment.\n\n6. **Check for System Updates:**\n   Ensure your macOS is up-to-date, as system updates may include necessary library updates.\n\nIf none of these solutions work, you might need to manually verify and ensure that the libraries (`libssl` and `libcrypto`) are compatible with the version of psycopg2 you are trying to use. Additionally, consulting the psycopg2 documentation or community might provide more insights specific to your setup."
