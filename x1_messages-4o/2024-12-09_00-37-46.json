Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nbinary_string = '11111111'\ninteger_value = int(binary_string, 2)\nprint(integer_value)  # Output: 255\n```\n\nIn this example, `'11111111'` is the binary string you want to convert, and by passing the base `2` as the second argument to the `int()` function, it converts the binary string into its corresponding integer value, which is `255`."
