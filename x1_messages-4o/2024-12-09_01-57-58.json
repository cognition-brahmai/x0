        "content": "To retrieve the size of an image using the `cv2` wrapper in Python OpenCV, you can use several approaches. One common method is using the `numpy.shape` attribute, but I'll show you another way to achieve this without directly using `numpy.shape`.\n\n### Method 1: Using `cv2` and `numpy.shape`\n\nThe typical way to get image dimensions is by loading the image using `cv2.imread()` and then accessing the shape attribute:\n\n```python\nimport cv2\n\n# Load the image\nimage = cv2.imread('path/to/your/image.jpg')\n\n# Get dimensions: height, width, and channels\nheight, width, channels = image.shape\n\n# Convert to (width, height)\ndimensions = (width, height)\n\nprint(\"Image dimensions (width, height):\", dimensions)\n```\n\n### Method 2: Using `cv2` methods\n\nAnother method to get the dimensions without explicitly using `numpy.shape` is through accessing the properties of the image directly:\n\n```python\nimport cv2\n\n# Load the image\nimage = cv2.imread('path/to/your/image.jpg')\n\n# Get image dimensions\nheight = image.shape[0]\nwidth = image.shape[1]\n\n# Convert to (width, height)\ndimensions = (width, height)\n\nprint(\"Image dimensions (width, height):\", dimensions)\n```\n\n### Method 3: Using `cv2` and `PIL` (Python Imaging Library)\n\nIf you prefer not to use `numpy.shape` at all, you can use the `PIL` library (Pillow) in conjunction with `cv2`:\n\n```python\nimport cv2\nfrom PIL import Image\n\n# Load the image using OpenCV\nimage = cv2.imread('path/to/your/image.jpg')\n\n# Convert it to a PIL Image\npil_image = Image.fromarray(cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB))\n\n# Get the dimensions directly using PIL\nwidth, height = pil_image.size\n\n# Dimensions are already in (width, height) format\nprint(\"Image dimensions (width, height):\", (width, height))\n```\n\nThese methods should help you retrieve the dimensions of an image in the format (width, height) without relying solely on `numpy.shape`."
