Please use the following data:\n- Genetic distance between fox and wolf: 0.2\n- Genetic distance between fox and cat: 0.5\n- Genetic distance between fox and dog: 0.3\n- Genetic distance between fox and raccoon: 0.6\nHint: You can use a simple if-else statement to compare the genetic distance between fox and each animal, and then output the animal with the smallest distance as the closest relative."

Below is a simple C++ program that uses if-else statements to determine which animal is the closest relative to the fox based on the given genetic distances:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <string>\n#include <limits>\n\nint main() {\n    // Genetic distances\n    double distanceToWolf = 0.2;\n    double distanceToCat = 0.5;\n    double distanceToDog = 0.3;\n    double distanceToRaccoon = 0.6;\n\n    // Initialize the closest distance with a large value\n    double closestDistance = std::numeric_limits<double>::max();\n    std::string closestRelative;\n\n    // Compare each genetic distance and find the smallest\n    if (distanceToWolf < closestDistance) {\n        closestDistance = distanceToWolf;\n        closestRelative = \"wolf\";\n    }\n    if (distanceToCat < closestDistance) {\n        closestDistance = distanceToCat;\n        closestRelative = \"cat\";\n    }\n    if (distanceToDog < closestDistance) {\n        closestDistance = distanceToDog;\n        closestRelative = \"dog\";\n    }\n    if (distanceToRaccoon < closestDistance) {\n        closestDistance = distanceToRaccoon;\n        closestRelative = \"raccoon\";\n    }\n\n    // Output the closest relative\n    std::cout << \"The closest relative of the fox based on genetic distance is the \" << closestRelative << \".\" << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis program initializes the closest genetic distance to a very large number, then iterates over each genetic distance to determine which one is the smallest. It updates the closest relative accordingly and finally outputs the result."
