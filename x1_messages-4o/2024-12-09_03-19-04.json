However, when I try to append the last name to the list, I am encountering a \"'NoneType' object has no attribute 'append'\" error. This is the code that I have been using:\n\n```python\nlast_list=[]\nif p.last_name==None or p.last_name==\"\": \n    pass\nlast_list=last_list.append(p.last_name)\nprint last_list\n```\nIn this code, `p` is an object I am using to retrieve information from my module, which contains data such as first name, last name, age etc. Could you please suggest a solution to overcome this issue?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is because the `append` method modifies the list in place and returns `None`. Therefore, when you do `last_list = last_list.append(p.last_name)`, you're effectively setting `last_list` to `None`. Instead, you should simply call `append` without assigning it back to `last_list`.\n\nHere's the corrected version of your code:\n\n```python\nlast_list = []\nif p.last_name is not None and p.last_name != \"\":\n    last_list.append(p.last_name)\n\nprint(last_list)\n```\n\nA few points to note:\n\n1. **Checking for `None`:** Use `is not None` instead of `== None` for checking `None` values. This is the recommended practice in Python.\n\n2. **Appending to List:** Simply call `last_list.append(p.last_name)` without assigning it back to `last_list`.\n\n3. **Print Function:** Use `print()` with parentheses as required in Python 3.\n\nThis should resolve the error you're facing. If you have a list of users and want to iterate over them to build the `last_list`, make sure to include a loop as well."
