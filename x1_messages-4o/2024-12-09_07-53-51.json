The `random.random()` function returns a random float number between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive).\n\nHere's how you can use it:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nrandom_float = random.random()\nprint(random_float)\n```\n\nThe `random.randrange(0, 1)` function is not suitable in this case because it is designed to return an integer, and when you specify a range from 0 to 1, it only includes 0 as a possible value, hence always returning 0."
