However, I am noticing that the number of rows in the merged data frame is larger than the original data frame. Here is the code I am using:\n\n```python\npanel = pd.read_csv(file1, encoding ='cp932')\nbefore_len = len(panel)\n\nprof_2000 = pd.read_csv(file2, encoding ='cp932').drop_duplicates()\n\ntemp_2000 = pd.merge(panel, prof_2000, left_on='Candidate_u', right_on=\"name2\", how=\"left\")\n\nafter_len =  len(temp_2000)\nprint(before_len, after_len)\n> 12661 13915\n```\n\nWhy does this happen? Why is the number of rows increasing even when I am using a left merge?"

        "content": "When you perform a left merge using `pandas.merge`, the resulting DataFrame will contain all the rows from the left DataFrame (`panel` in your case), and the rows from the right DataFrame (`prof_2000`) will be matched based on the specified keys. If there are duplicate values in the merge key in the right DataFrame (`prof_2000`), this can lead to an increase in the number of rows in the resulting DataFrame. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Duplicates in the Right DataFrame**: If `prof_2000` has multiple rows with the same value in the `name2` column, then for each of these rows, a separate row will be created in the result for each matching key in the left DataFrame. This is because each matching row in the right DataFrame will be paired with the corresponding row in the left DataFrame.\n\n2. **Example Scenario**: Suppose you have the following:\n\n   - `panel` has a row with `Candidate_u = 'A'`.\n   - `prof_2000` has two rows with `name2 = 'A'`.\n\n   In this case, the merged DataFrame will have two rows corresponding to `Candidate_u = 'A'`, each paired with one of the rows from `prof_2000`.\n\n3. **Solution**: To avoid this issue, ensure there are no duplicates in your merge key in the right DataFrame. You mentioned using `.drop_duplicates()`, but you need to ensure it is applied correctly. Verify that `name2` has no duplicates after this operation:\n\n   ```python\n   prof_2000 = prof_2000.drop_duplicates(subset='name2')\n   ```\n\n   This will drop duplicate rows based on the `name2` column only.\n\n4. **Additional Checks**: You can also check for duplicates before the merge:\n\n   ```python\n   duplicates = prof_2000[prof_2000.duplicated(subset='name2', keep=False)]\n   print(duplicates)\n   ```\n\n   This will show you which rows are causing the duplication issue. \n\nBy addressing the duplicates in the `name2` column of `prof_2000`, you should be able to achieve a merged DataFrame with the expected number of rows."
