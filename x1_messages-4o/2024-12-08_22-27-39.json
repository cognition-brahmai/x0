They help to make sentences more specific and detailed by answering questions like \"what kind?\", \"which one?\", or \"how many?\"\n\nFor example, in the sentence \"The tall building is impressive,\" the word \"tall\" is an adjective that describes the noun \"building,\" giving us more information about its height."
