        "content": "There are several algorithms for sorting an array of numbers. Here are a few commonly used ones:\n\n1. **Bubble Sort**:\n   - Repeatedly step through the list, compare adjacent elements, and swap them if they are in the wrong order.\n   - This process is repeated until the list is sorted.\n   - It's simple but inefficient for large data sets with a time complexity of \\(O(n^2)\\).\n\n2. **Selection Sort**:\n   - Divide the list into a sorted and unsorted region.\n   - Repeatedly select the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element from the unsorted region and move it to the end of the sorted region.\n   - Time complexity is \\(O(n^2)\\).\n\n3. **Insertion Sort**:\n   - Build the final sorted array one item at a time.\n   - Take one element from the unsorted region and insert it into its correct position in the sorted region.\n   - Time complexity is \\(O(n^2)\\), but it's efficient for small data sets or partially sorted arrays.\n\n4. **Merge Sort**:\n   - Divide the array into two halves, sort each half, and then merge them back together.\n   - This is a recursive algorithm with a time complexity of \\(O(n \\log n)\\).\n\n5. **Quick Sort**:\n   - Pick a \"pivot\" element and partition the array into elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot.\n   - Recursively apply the same strategy to the sub-arrays.\n   - Average time complexity is \\(O(n \\log n)\\), but can degrade to \\(O(n^2)\\) in the worst case.\n\n6. **Heap Sort**:\n   - Build a heap from the input data and repeatedly extract the maximum element from the heap.\n   - Time complexity is \\(O(n \\log n)\\).\n\n7. **Counting Sort**:\n   - Count the number of occurrences of each element and use this information to place elements in their correct position.\n   - Suitable for integers and works in \\(O(n + k)\\) time, where \\(k\\) is the range of the input.\n\n8. **Radix Sort**:\n   - Process each digit of the numbers starting from the least significant to the most significant.\n   - Use a stable sorting algorithm like counting sort as a subroutine.\n   - Time complexity is \\(O(nk)\\), where \\(k\\) is the number of digits.\n\n9. **Bucket Sort**:\n   - Distribute the elements into a number of buckets, then sort each bucket individually.\n   - Combine the sorted buckets to get the final sorted array.\n   - Time complexity can be \\(O(n + k)\\), where \\(k\\) is the number of buckets.\n\nEach of these algorithms has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which to use depends on the specific requirements of the problem, such as the size of the array and whether the array is partially sorted."
