        "content": "In Jinja2, there isn't a built-in concept of 'here' that directly refers to the current directory of the template being processed. Jinja2's template loading mechanism is usually based on an environment that defines a specific loader, such as `FileSystemLoader`, which looks for templates in specified directories.\n\nWhen you want to include or extend other templates, Jinja2 expects you to provide a path relative to the directories specified in your loader configuration. Unfortunately, Jinja2 doesn't provide a syntax like `%(here)s` to automatically resolve paths relative to the current template's location in the filesystem.\n\nHowever, you can achieve similar functionality by structuring your Jinja2 environment and templates accordingly:\n\n1. **Directory Structure**: Organize your templates in a way that they maintain relative paths you can easily reference.\n\n2. **Custom Loader**: Implement a custom loader if you need more dynamic path resolution based on the current template's location.\n\n3. **Macros and Blocks**: Use Jinja2 features like macros and blocks to modularize and reuse parts of templates within the allowable structure.\n\nHere's a simple example of how you might set up your environment:\n\n```python\nfrom jinja2 import Environment, FileSystemLoader\n\n# Assuming your templates are inside the 'templates' directory\nenv = Environment(loader=FileSystemLoader('templates'))\n\n# Load a template\ntemplate = env.get_template('base.html')\n\n# Render the template\nrendered = template.render()\n```\n\nIn your `base.html`, you can include other templates using relative paths according to the structure you defined in the `FileSystemLoader`:\n\n```html\n{% include 'partials/header.html' %}\n{% include 'partials/footer.html' %}\n```\n\nRemember, the paths in the `include` or `extend` statements should be relative to the directories specified in the loader, not the location of the current template."
