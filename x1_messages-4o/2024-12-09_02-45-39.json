In Python, the expression is written as:\n\n```python\na = \"123\" if b else \"456\"\n```\n\nIn this Python expression, if `b` evaluates to `True`, `a` will be assigned the value `\"123\"`. Otherwise, `a` will be assigned the value `\"456\"`. This is a concise way to perform conditional assignments in Python, similar to the ternary operator in C++."
