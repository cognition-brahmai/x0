For instance, when I use the following code:\n\n```python\nprint('''\ndog\ncat\n''')\n```\n\nI find that it includes newlines at the top and bottom. I can remove them by adjusting the code like so:\n\n```python\nprint('''dog\ncat''')\n```\n\nHowever, this method makes the code far less readable for me. Is there a better way to achieve this?"

If you want to maintain readability while avoiding the extra newlines at the top and bottom of your multi-line string, you can use the `textwrap` module to help manage the indentation. Here\u2019s a clean way to handle it:\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ntext = \"\"\"\n    dog\n    cat\n\"\"\"\n# Remove leading whitespace from each line and strip the overall string\nformatted_text = textwrap.dedent(text).strip()\n\nprint(formatted_text)\n```\n\nThis approach allows you to write your string with readable indentation in your code, while `textwrap.dedent()` removes any common leading whitespace, and `strip()` removes the leading and trailing newlines."
