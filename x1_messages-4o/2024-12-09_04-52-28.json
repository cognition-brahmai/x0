For instance, using the code:\n\n```python\nplt.bar([1, 2], [4, 5])\nplt.xlabel(\"My x label\")\nplt.ylabel(r\"My long label with $\\Sigma_{C}$ math \\n continues here\") \n```\n\nI want the y-label to be centered as well. Is it possible to accomplish this while keeping the TeX (enclosed in '$') and the newline in the label?"

        "content": "Yes, you can include a newline in a plot's label in Matplotlib and have it centered. To achieve this, you can use the newline character `\\n` within the label string. Additionally, you can use LaTeX math formatting by enclosing expressions within `$` symbols. To center the label text, you can adjust the `labelpad` and `fontsize` if necessary for better visual appeal.\n\nHere's how you can modify your example code to include a newline in the y-label while keeping the LaTeX math formatting:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Create a bar plot\nplt.bar([1, 2], [4, 5])\n\n# Set the x-label\nplt.xlabel(\"My x label\")\n\n# Set the y-label with a newline and math formatting\nplt.ylabel(\"My long label with $\\Sigma_{C}$ math\\ncontinues here\", labelpad=20, fontsize=12)\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- The newline character `\\n` is used to split the label into two lines.\n- `labelpad` is used to adjust the padding between the label and the axis, which can help in centering the label visually.\n- `fontsize` is optional and can be adjusted to make the label more readable.\n\nThis should give you a y-label that includes a newline and properly displays the mathematical expression using LaTeX formatting."
