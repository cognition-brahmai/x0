        "content": "I have an application written in Python and compiled with PyInstaller which uses PyQt for the GUI framework. There is a noticeable delay of about 10 seconds before the main window loads and shows up. I suspect this delay is due to the Python runtime initializing and not due to any issues in my code. The application is started with a custom launcher/taskbar application and due to the delay, the application window does not come to the foreground immediately. I have access to the source for the PyInstaller win32 loader, the Python code, and the launcher code. How can I make this application start faster? How can I measure the time spent in the first few seconds of the process's lifetime? What is the generally accepted technique for reducing time until the first window is shown? I would rather not add a splash screen or edit the PyInstaller loader stub to create a window."

        "content": "Improving the startup time of a PyInstaller-packed Python application, especially with a GUI framework like PyQt, can be challenging but there are several strategies you can explore to optimize and diagnose the startup performance:\n\n### Profiling Startup Time\n1. **Logging with Timestamps:** Add logging statements with timestamps throughout your application initialization code. This will help you identify which parts of the startup process are taking the most time.\n   ```python\n   import time\n   import logging\n\n   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\n\n   def log_time(label):\n       logging.debug(f\"{label}: {time.perf_counter()}\")\n\n   log_time(\"Start of main\")\n   # Your initialization code\n   log_time(\"End of initialization\")\n   ```\n\n2. **PyInstaller Bootloader Profiling:** Since you have access to the PyInstaller source, you can compile a custom bootloader with profiling code to measure the loading time. This requires modifying the bootloader code to log timestamps at various stages.\n\n### Reducing Startup Time\n1. **Optimize Imports:** Ensure that you are only importing necessary modules at startup. Lazy-load modules that are not immediately required.\n   ```python\n   def main():\n       import module_needed_immediately\n       # Delay other imports until needed\n       import module_needed_later\n   ```\n\n2. **Use a Virtual Environment:** Ensure your application is running in a clean virtual environment to avoid unnecessary packages being included.\n\n3. **Exclude Unnecessary Packages:** Use PyInstaller\u2019s `--exclude-module` option to exclude unnecessary packages from the build.\n\n4. **Reduce .spec File Content:** Review your `.spec` file and remove any unnecessary binaries, data files, or modules.\n\n5. **Optimize PyQt Loading:** Consider using tools like `PyQt5-tools` to freeze only the necessary parts of PyQt. Additionally, try to reduce the complexity of your initial GUI setup.\n\n6. **Compression and UPX:** Ensure that UPX compression is used for your executable to reduce the file size, which can sometimes reduce load times. However, this might also increase CPU usage during decompression.\n\n7. **Check for External Dependencies:** Ensure that there are no unnecessary network calls or file system operations during startup.\n\n### Additional Techniques\n- **Precompiled Components:** Precompile parts of your application that don't change often.\n- **Profile with External Tools:** Use tools like `cProfile`, `py-spy`, or `time` to profile the startup performance outside of your application.\n- **Asynchronous Initialization:** If possible, load non-essential components asynchronously after the main window is displayed.\n\nBy combining these profiling and optimization techniques, you should be able to identify bottlenecks and reduce the startup time of your PyQt application."
