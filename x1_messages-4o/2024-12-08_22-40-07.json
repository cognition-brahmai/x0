        "content": "To create a precise API request URL for retrieving technical details of a Lamborghini Aventador, you need to include specific query parameters such as the year, trim level, and the desired information category (e.g., performance, safety). The exact format will depend on the API you are using, but a general structure might look like this:\n\n```\nhttps://api.carspecs.com/getDetails?make=Lamborghini&model=Aventador&year=2023&trim=SVJ&category=performance\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the components:\n\n1. **Base URL**: `https://api.carspecs.com/getDetails` - This is the endpoint where the API accepts requests.\n\n2. **Query Parameters**:\n   - `make=Lamborghini`: Specifies the car manufacturer.\n   - `model=Aventador`: Specifies the car model.\n   - `year=2023`: Specifies the model year of the car.\n   - `trim=SVJ`: Specifies the trim level of the car. Adjust this based on the specific trim you are interested in.\n   - `category=performance`: Specifies the type of information you want. You can change this to `safety`, `dimensions`, `features`, etc., depending on what the API supports.\n\nMake sure to check the API documentation specific to the service you are using, as the parameter names and structure might vary. Additionally, some APIs may require authentication tokens or keys, which should be included in the headers or as additional parameters."
