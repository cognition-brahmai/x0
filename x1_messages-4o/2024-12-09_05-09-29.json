However, I want to add additional fields for email and full name, and I want these fields to be required. I have tried adding these fields to a custom UserCreationForm, but while the fields do show up in the form, they are not being saved to the database. How can I fix this issue? Here's the code I've written so far:\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm\nfrom django import forms\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User\n\nclass RegisterForm(UserCreationForm):\n    email = forms.EmailField(label = \"Email\")\n    fullname = forms.CharField(label = \"Full name\")\n\n    class Meta:\n        model = User\n        fields = (\"username\", \"fullname\", \"email\", )\n```"

        "content": "To extend the default `UserCreationForm` to include additional fields like email and full name, and ensure these fields are saved to the database, you need to customize the form and also handle the saving process properly. The `User` model in Django already has an `email` field, but it doesn't have a `fullname` field. You'll typically want to store the full name in the `first_name` and `last_name` fields, or add a custom field to your user model. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n1. **Extend the User model**: If you want to store the full name in a single field, you'll need to extend the `User` model to include a `fullname` field. Otherwise, you can split it into `first_name` and `last_name`.\n\n2. **Custom UserCreationForm**: Modify the form to handle these fields.\n\n3. **Save the additional fields**: Override the `save` method to handle the additional fields.\n\nHere's how you can implement these changes:\n\n### Step 1: Extend the User Model (Optional)\n\nIf you want to store the full name in a single field, you'll need to extend the `User` model. Otherwise, you can skip this step and use `first_name` and `last_name`.\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass CustomUser(AbstractUser):\n    fullname = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True, null=True)\n\n# Don't forget to update your settings.py\n# AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'yourapp.CustomUser'\n```\n\n### Step 2: Custom UserCreationForm\n\nModify your `RegisterForm` to handle the additional fields.\n\n```python\nfrom django import forms\nfrom django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm\nfrom .models import CustomUser  # Use your custom user model if extended\n\nclass RegisterForm(UserCreationForm):\n    email = forms.EmailField(required=True, label=\"Email\")\n    fullname = forms.CharField(required=True, label=\"Full name\")\n\n    class Meta:\n        model = CustomUser  # Use your custom user model if extended\n        fields = (\"username\", \"fullname\", \"email\", \"password1\", \"password2\")\n\n    def save(self, commit=True):\n        user = super(RegisterForm, self).save(commit=False)\n        user.email = self.cleaned_data['email']\n        user.fullname = self.cleaned_data['fullname']  # Use full name field if extended\n        if commit:\n            user.save()\n        return user\n```\n\n### Step 3: Update your settings\n\nIf you extended the `User` model, ensure your `settings.py` reflects the custom user model:\n\n```python\nAUTH_USER_MODEL = 'yourapp.CustomUser'\n```\n\n### Step 4: Apply Migrations\n\nIf you've created a custom user model with additional fields, don't forget to apply migrations:\n\n```bash\npython manage.py makemigrations\npython manage.py migrate\n```\n\n### Note\n\nIf you're using `first_name` and `last_name` instead of a custom `fullname`, you can adjust the form and save method accordingly:\n\n```python\nclass RegisterForm(UserCreationForm):\n    email = forms.EmailField(required=True, label=\"Email\")\n    first_name = forms.CharField(required=True, label=\"First name\")\n    last_name = forms.CharField(required=True, label=\"Last name\")\n\n    class Meta:\n        model = User\n        fields = (\"username\", \"first_name\", \"last_name\", \"email\", \"password1\", \"password2\")\n\n    def save(self, commit=True):\n        user = super(RegisterForm, self).save(commit=False)\n        user.email = self.cleaned_data['email']\n        user.first_name = self.cleaned_data['first_name']\n        user.last_name = self.cleaned_data['last_name']\n        if commit:\n            user.save()\n        return user\n```\n\nWith these changes, your form should now correctly save the additional fields to the database."
