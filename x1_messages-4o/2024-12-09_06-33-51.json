        "content": "The error message you're encountering, \"relative imports require the 'package' argument,\" indicates an issue with how Python resolves modules when generating documentation with Sphinx. This often happens when Sphinx cannot properly locate or import your Django project's modules. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the problem:\n\n1. **Ensure Django is Initialized Correctly**: Ensure that the Django environment is correctly initialized before importing any Django models or modules. This is typically done by setting the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable and calling `django.setup()`:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   import sys\n   import django\n   \n   sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../cloud_server/cloud_api'))\n   os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'cloud_server.settings'\n   django.setup()\n   ```\n\n   Note: Replace `'cloud_server.settings'` with the correct Python path to your Django settings module.\n\n2. **Check `sys.path`**: Verify that the `sys.path` addition in your `conf.py` is pointing to the correct directory where your Django apps and modules are located. If `views.py` is not directly in the `cloud_api` directory, adjust the path accordingly.\n\n3. **Fully Qualify Module Imports in Sphinx**: In your RST files where you're using autodoc, make sure to fully qualify the module names. For example, if your `views.py` is in the `cloud_api` package, reference it as `cloud_api.views` instead of just `views`.\n\n4. **Relative Imports**: Ensure that your Python files within the Django project do not use relative imports unless necessary, as they can sometimes cause issues with external tools like Sphinx.\n\n5. **Check the `autodoc` configuration**: Ensure your Sphinx `conf.py` is correctly set up to use autodoc. Make sure `autodoc` is included in the `extensions` list:\n\n   ```python\n   extensions = [\n       'sphinx.ext.autodoc',\n       'sphinx.ext.viewcode',\n       # add other extensions as needed\n   ]\n   ```\n\n6. **Verify the Django Version**: Make sure you are using a compatible version of Django that works well with your Sphinx setup. Sometimes, upgrading or downgrading Django or Sphinx can resolve compatibility issues.\n\n7. **Run Sphinx in the Correct Environment**: Make sure you're running Sphinx in the same environment where Django and its dependencies are installed. This ensures all modules are available for import.\n\nAfter making these changes, try running `make html` again to see if the problem is resolved. If the issue persists, consider checking the detailed traceback for more specific clues about what might be going wrong."
