        "content": "To analyze the dataset \\( B = \\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 100, 12\\} \\) and determine the data point with the highest variance, we first need to understand the concept of variance. Variance measures how much the values in a dataset differ from the mean of the dataset.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Mean\n\nThe mean (\\(\\mu\\)) of the dataset is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\mu = \\frac{2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 100 + 12}{7} = \\frac{142}{7} = 20.2857\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Variance\n\nVariance (\\(\\sigma^2\\)) is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \\mu)^2\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( x_i \\) are the data points and \\( n \\) is the number of data points.\n\n\\[\n\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{7}((2-20.2857)^2 + (4-20.2857)^2 + (6-20.2857)^2 + (8-20.2857)^2 + (10-20.2857)^2 + (100-20.2857)^2 + (12-20.2857)^2)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{7}(332.938 + 266.938 + 204.938 + 146.938 + 92.938 + 6358.938 + 68.938)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{7}(7472.564) = 1067.509\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Data Point with the Highest Contribution to Variance\n\nClearly, the data point 100 has the highest contribution to the variance due to its significant deviation from the mean (20.2857). \n\n### Factors Responsible for High Variance\n\n1. **Outlier Presence**: The value 100 is an outlier, significantly larger than the other data points.\n2. **Data Entry Error**: It might be a result of a data entry error or an anomaly.\n3. **Natural Variation**: It could represent a genuine result from a process with naturally high variability.\n\n### Solutions to Mitigate High Variance\n\n1. **Outlier Removal**: Exclude the outlier if it is deemed irrelevant or erroneous.\n   - **Execution**: Analyze the context of data collection to justify removal. Recalculate variance without the outlier.\n\n2. **Data Transformation**: Apply transformations like log or square root to reduce the effect of outliers.\n   - **Execution**: Transform dataset and recalculate statistics. Compare the variance before and after.\n\n3. **Robust Statistical Methods**: Use median and interquartile range instead of mean and standard deviation.\n   - **Execution**: Calculate median and IQR, offering resistance to outliers.\n\n4. **Data Segmentation**: Separate data into subsets if the outlier belongs to a different population.\n   - **Execution**: Analyze subsets individually for more meaningful insights.\n\n5. **Verification and Validation**: Verify data entry and validation processes to avoid future outliers.\n   - **Execution**: Implement checks during data collection and entry phases.\n\nBy implementing these solutions, the dataset can be refined to reflect a more accurate representation of the underlying phenomena, thereby ensuring optimal results."
