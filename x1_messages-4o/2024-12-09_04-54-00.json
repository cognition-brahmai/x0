Right now, I am following a rate limit of 50 requests/second but sequential requests are too slow to reach this limit. When I try to use parallel requests with aiohttp, it exceeds the rate limit. I have tried decorating `session.get` like so `session.get = rate_limited(max_calls_per_second)(session.get)` but this only works well for sequential calls. Implementing this in parallel calls does not function as expected. \n\nFor example, here is the code I am using:\n\n```\nasync with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n    session.get = rate_limited(max_calls_per_second)(session.get)\n    tasks = (asyncio.ensure_future(download_coroutine(timeout, session, url)) for url in urls)\n    process_responses_function(await asyncio.gather(*tasks))\n```\n\nThe issue with this code is that it rate-limits the queueing of the tasks and the execution with `gather` still occurs more or less at the same time. I want to limit the rate of requests, not the queueing. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "To effectively limit the number of requests per second for parallel aiohttp requests, you'll need a strategy that doesn't just rate-limit the queuing of tasks but actually controls the rate at which the requests are made. One way to achieve this is by using a semaphore to limit the number of concurrent requests, combined with a delay to ensure requests are spread out over time.\n\nHere's a structured approach to accomplish this:\n\n1. Use an asyncio Semaphore to limit the number of concurrent requests.\n2. Introduce a delay between requests to ensure they are spread out to meet the rate limit requirements.\n\nHere's a sample implementation:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport aiohttp\nimport time\n\nasync def rate_limited_download(session, url, semaphore, delay):\n    async with semaphore:\n        async with session.get(url) as response:\n            await asyncio.sleep(delay)  # Delay to control the request rate\n            return await response.text()\n\nasync def main(urls, max_requests_per_second):\n    semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(max_requests_per_second)\n    delay = 1 / max_requests_per_second  # Calculate delay in seconds\n\n    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n        tasks = [\n            asyncio.create_task(rate_limited_download(session, url, semaphore, delay))\n            for url in urls\n        ]\n        responses = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)\n        # Process the responses as needed\n        process_responses_function(responses)\n\ndef process_responses_function(responses):\n    # Implement your processing logic here\n    for response in responses:\n        print(response)\n\n# Example usage\nurls = ['http://example.com'] * 100  # Replace with your actual URLs\nmax_requests_per_second = 50\n\nasyncio.run(main(urls, max_requests_per_second))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Semaphore**: Limits the number of concurrent requests.\n- **Delay**: Ensures that requests are spaced out over time to adhere to the specified rate limit.\n- **`asyncio.create_task`**: Schedules each request as a separate task.\n\nThis approach will help you maintain a consistent rate of requests per second while handling multiple requests concurrently. Adjust the `max_requests_per_second` according to your rate limits and ensure that the `urls` list contains the URLs you wish to fetch."
