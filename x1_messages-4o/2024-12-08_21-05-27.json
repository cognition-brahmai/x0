        "content": "To solve the problem of finding all pairs in an array of integers that sum up to a given value \\( k \\), we can design an efficient algorithm using a hash map (or dictionary) to keep track of the numbers we have seen so far and their counts. This approach allows us to achieve an average time complexity of \\( O(n) \\), where \\( n \\) is the number of elements in the array.\n\nHere's a step-by-step algorithm:\n\n1. **Initialize a Hash Map**: Create an empty hash map to store the frequency of each number in the array.\n\n2. **Initialize a Result List**: Create an empty list to store the resulting pairs.\n\n3. **Iterate Over the Array**: For each element \\( num \\) in the array:\n   - Calculate the complement \\( complement = k - num \\).\n   - Check if the complement exists in the hash map:\n     - If it exists and its count is greater than zero, add the pair \\( (complement, num) \\) to the result list.\n     - Decrement the count of the complement in the hash map.\n   - Add or update the count of \\( num \\) in the hash map.\n\n4. **Return the Result List**: After iterating through the array, return the list of pairs.\n\nHere's the pseudocode for the algorithm:\n\n```plaintext\nfunction findPairsWithSum(array, k):\n    hashMap = {}  // Initialize an empty hash map\n    result = []   // Initialize an empty list for storing pairs\n\n    for num in array:\n        complement = k - num\n        if complement in hashMap and hashMap[complement] > 0:\n            result.append((complement, num))\n            hashMap[complement] -= 1  // Decrement the count of the complement\n        else:\n            // Add or update the count of num in the hash map\n            if num in hashMap:\n                hashMap[num] += 1\n            else:\n                hashMap[num] = 1\n\n    return result\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- **Hash Map Usage**: The hash map keeps track of how many times each number has been seen, allowing us to efficiently check for the existence of the complement.\n- **Efficiency**: This algorithm processes each element of the array exactly once, making it more efficient than a naive \\( O(n^2) \\) approach which would involve checking all possible pairs.\n- **Edge Cases**: This algorithm handles duplicates and ensures each pair is unique in the sense that the same pair won't be counted more than once if it occurs multiple times in the array."
