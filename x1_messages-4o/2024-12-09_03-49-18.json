I am encountering an error when trying to convert these to datetime using the lambda function in conjunction with the datetime library. The error message reads \"time data 'nan' does not match format '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'\". In an attempt to solve this, I tried converting all 'nan' values to actual nulls using numpy, but I am then confronted with another error, \"must be string, not float\". How can I overcome this issue and successfully convert my series to datetime?"

        "content": "To successfully convert your series containing datetime strings and 'nan' values to a datetime format using pandas, you can follow these steps. The key is to handle the 'nan' values properly and use pandas' built-in functionality for datetime conversion, which is more robust than using a lambda function with the datetime library. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. First, ensure that 'nan' values are properly recognized as `NaN` (Not a Number) using `numpy.nan`. This will allow pandas to handle them correctly as missing values.\n\n2. Use the `pd.to_datetime` function provided by pandas, which can handle these `NaN` values gracefully and convert the rest to datetime.\n\nHere's a step-by-step code example:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Sample data\ndata = ['2023-01-01 12:00:00', '2023-02-01 14:30:00', 'nan', '2023-03-01 09:45:00', 'nan']\n\n# Convert 'nan' strings to actual NaN values\nseries = pd.Series(data).replace('nan', np.nan)\n\n# Convert the series to datetime\n# errors='coerce' will convert invalid parsing to NaT (Not a Time), which is pandas' equivalent of NaN for datetime\ndatetime_series = pd.to_datetime(series, errors='coerce', format='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')\n\nprint(datetime_series)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`replace('nan', np.nan)`**: This step ensures that all 'nan' string values are converted to `np.nan`, which is recognized as a missing value by pandas.\n\n- **`pd.to_datetime(series, errors='coerce', format='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')`**: This function attempts to convert each element in the series to a datetime object. The `errors='coerce'` parameter tells pandas to convert any parsing errors to `NaT`, which stands for \"Not a Time\" (similar to `NaN` for numeric data).\n\nThis approach should eliminate the errors you encountered and provide you with a series of datetime objects, with `NaT` where the original data was 'nan'."
