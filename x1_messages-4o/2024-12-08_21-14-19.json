        "content": "Certainly! You can achieve this in Bash using a combination of tools like `grep`, `wc`, and `sed` or `awk`. Here's a step-by-step explanation followed by a sample script to accomplish this task:\n\n1. **Count occurrences of the word**: Use `grep -o` to find all occurrences of the word and pipe it to `wc -l` to count them.\n2. **Replace the word with the count**: Use `sed` to replace the word with the format `count(word)`.\n\nHere's a sample script that does this:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Specify the word to count and replace\nWORD=\"your_word\"\n\n# Specify the input file\nINPUT_FILE=\"input.txt\"\n\n# Count the occurrences of the word\nCOUNT=$(grep -o \"\\b$WORD\\b\" \"$INPUT_FILE\" | wc -l)\n\n# Replace the word with \"count(word)\"\nsed -i \"s/\\b$WORD\\b/$COUNT\\($WORD\\)/g\" \"$INPUT_FILE\"\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `grep -o \"\\b$WORD\\b\" \"$INPUT_FILE\"`: Finds all occurrences of the word as a whole word (`\\b` is a word boundary).\n- `wc -l`: Counts the number of lines, which corresponds to the number of times the word appears.\n- `sed -i \"s/\\b$WORD\\b/$COUNT\\($WORD\\)/g\" \"$INPUT_FILE\"`: Replaces each occurrence of the word with `count(word)` in the input file. The `-i` flag means the file is edited in place.\n\n### Notes:\n- Replace `\"your_word\"` with the word you are interested in.\n- Replace `\"input.txt\"` with the path to your text file.\n- This script will modify the file in place. If you want to keep the original file, remove the `-i` option from `sed` and redirect the output to a new file.\n\nRemember to make your script executable with `chmod +x scriptname.sh` and then run it with `./scriptname.sh`."
