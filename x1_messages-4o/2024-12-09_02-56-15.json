Since Python 2.6, the documentation is in the reStructuredText format and it doesn't seem very easy to build a Texinfo Info file out of the box anymore. I prefer my documentation installed in Info. Is there a way to have Python 2.6 or later docs in Texinfo format? How can I convert them? Alternatively, is there a maintained build somewhere?"

        "content": "Converting Python documentation from reStructuredText (reST) to Texinfo Info format can be a bit challenging, as the official documentation does not provide a direct way to produce Texinfo files. However, you can achieve this by following these steps:\n\n1. **Use Sphinx**:\n   - Python documentation is written using reStructuredText and built using Sphinx. Sphinx can output documentation in several formats, but unfortunately, Texinfo is not one of the default options.\n   \n2. **Convert reStructuredText to Texinfo**:\n   - First, you'll need to convert the reStructuredText to a format that can be converted to Texinfo. A common intermediate format is HTML or LaTeX.\n   - You can use Sphinx to generate HTML or LaTeX documentation. Run the following command to generate HTML:\n     ```bash\n     sphinx-build -b html sourcedir builddir\n     ```\n   - For LaTeX output:\n     ```bash\n     sphinx-build -b latex sourcedir builddir\n     ```\n   \n3. **Convert HTML/LaTeX to Texinfo**:\n   - If you have generated HTML, you can use tools like `html2texi` to convert the HTML files to Texinfo. Similarly, for LaTeX, you might find a tool like `pandoc` useful:\n     ```bash\n     pandoc -s input.html -o output.texi\n     ```\n   - You might need to install `pandoc` or any other conversion tool that supports this operation.\n\n4. **Compile Texinfo to Info**:\n   - Once you have the Texinfo files, you can use the `makeinfo` command to compile them into Info files:\n     ```bash\n     makeinfo output.texi\n     ```\n\n5. **Consider Automation**:\n   - If you plan to do this often, consider writing a script that automates these steps, checking for errors at each stage, and managing dependencies.\n\n6. **Look for Community Solutions**:\n   - Check online resources, forums, or GitHub repositories to see if someone in the community has already created a tool or maintains a version of the Python documentation in Texinfo format. The Python community is large and active, and someone might have addressed this need.\n\nWhile this process involves several steps and might require some trial and error to perfect, it should allow you to convert Python documentation to the desired Texinfo format."
