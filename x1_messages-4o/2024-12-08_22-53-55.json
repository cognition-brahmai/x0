        "content": "Creating a Jeopardy game using Go is a fun way to practice programming with this language. Below is a simple example to help you get started. This example will demonstrate how to structure your program with functions and variables to manage questions, answers, and categories.\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"math/rand\"\n\t\"time\"\n)\n\n// Question struct to store question details\ntype Question struct {\n\tquestion string\n\tanswer   string\n\tpoints   int\n}\n\n// Category struct to store a category and its questions\ntype Category struct {\n\tname      string\n\tquestions []Question\n}\n\n// Function to initialize categories with questions\nfunc initializeCategories() []Category {\n\treturn []Category{\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tname: \"Programming Languages\",\n\t\t\tquestions: []Question{\n\t\t\t\t{\"What language is known as the backbone of web development?\", \"JavaScript\", 100},\n\t\t\t\t{\"Which language is considered the mother of all programming languages?\", \"C\", 200},\n\t\t\t\t{\"What is the most popular programming language for data science?\", \"Python\", 300},\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tname: \"Data Structures\",\n\t\t\tquestions: []Question{\n\t\t\t\t{\"What data structure uses LIFO?\", \"Stack\", 100},\n\t\t\t\t{\"Name a data structure that uses FIFO.\", \"Queue\", 200},\n\t\t\t\t{\"What is a self-balancing binary search tree called?\", \"AVL Tree\", 300},\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tname: \"Algorithms\",\n\t\t\tquestions: []Question{\n\t\t\t\t{\"What algorithm is used to find the shortest path in a graph?\", \"Dijkstra's Algorithm\", 100},\n\t\t\t\t{\"Name an algorithm used for sorting.\", \"Quick Sort\", 200},\n\t\t\t\t{\"Which algorithm is used to solve the traveling salesman problem?\", \"Dynamic Programming\", 300},\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t},\n\t}\n}\n\n// Function to ask a question and return points if the answer is correct\nfunc askQuestion(category Category, questionIndex int) int {\n\tquestion := category.questions[questionIndex]\n\tfmt.Printf(\"Category: %s, Question: %s [%d points]\\n\", category.name, question.question, question.points)\n\tvar answer string\n\tfmt.Print(\"Your answer: \")\n\tfmt.Scanln(&answer)\n\tif answer == question.answer {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Correct!\")\n\t\treturn question.points\n\t} else {\n\t\tfmt.Printf(\"Incorrect! The correct answer was: %s\\n\", question.answer)\n\t\treturn 0\n\t}\n}\n\n// Main function to run the game\nfunc main() {\n\tcategories := initializeCategories()\n\ttotalPoints := 0\n\n\trand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())\n\tfor i := 0; i < 3; i++ { // Number of rounds\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"\\n---------- Round\", i+1, \"----------\")\n\t\tcategoryIndex := rand.Intn(len(categories))\n\t\tquestionIndex := rand.Intn(len(categories[categoryIndex].questions))\n\t\tpointsEarned := askQuestion(categories[categoryIndex], questionIndex)\n\t\ttotalPoints += pointsEarned\n\t}\n\n\tfmt.Printf(\"\\nGame Over! Total Points: %d\\n\", totalPoints)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Structures**:\n   - `Question`: Defines a structure for storing question details.\n   - `Category`: Defines a structure for storing a category and its associated questions.\n\n2. **Functions**:\n   - `initializeCategories()`: Initializes and returns a list of categories with questions.\n   - `askQuestion()`: Takes a category and question index, asks the question, checks the answer, and returns the points earned.\n\n3. **Main Function**:\n   - Initializes the categories using `initializeCategories()`.\n   - Runs a loop for a predefined number of rounds where it randomly selects a category and a question, asks the question, and updates the total points based on the response.\n\n### Customization:\n- You can extend this game by adding more categories and questions.\n- You might also consider implementing a user interface using a library like `fyne` for a graphical display.\n\nThis is a basic console-based version, and you can enhance it by adding more features such as scoreboards, multiple players, etc. Enjoy building your Jeopardy game with Go!"
