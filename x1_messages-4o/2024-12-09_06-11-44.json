Let's say x = 0 and y =2, and the input array is:\n\n```python\na = [[4, 3, 1], \n     [5, 7, 0], \n     [9, 9, 3], \n     [8, 2, 4]]\n```\nI want my output to look like this:\n```python\n[[9, 9, 3], \n [5, 7, 0], \n [4, 3, 1], \n [8, 2, 4]]\n```\nHowever, when I tried swapping the rows using `a[x],a[y]= a[y],a[x]`, I got the incorrect output:\n```python\n[[9, 9, 3],\n [5, 7, 0],\n [9, 9, 3],\n [8, 2, 4]]\n```\nCan someone point out what's wrong with my solution?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is likely due to the way Python handles lists and assignments. When you perform the swap using `a[x], a[y] = a[y], a[x]`, it works correctly if `a` is a list of lists. However, if you're using a NumPy array, you need to ensure that you're using the correct syntax and handling to perform row swaps.\n\nHere's how you can swap rows using NumPy:\n\n1. First, ensure you're working with a NumPy array.\n2. Use indexed assignment to swap the rows.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the array\na = np.array([[4, 3, 1], \n              [5, 7, 0], \n              [9, 9, 3], \n              [8, 2, 4]])\n\n# Specify the rows to swap\nx, y = 0, 2\n\n# Swap the rows\na[[x, y]] = a[[y, x]]\n\n# Print the resulting array\nprint(a)\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n[[9 9 3]\n [5 7 0]\n [4 3 1]\n [8 2 4]]\n```\n\nBy using `a[[x, y]] = a[[y, x]]`, you are telling NumPy to swap the specified rows `x` and `y`, and it handles this correctly by creating a temporary copy before swapping, thus avoiding the issue you faced."
