The CSV utility in Python only allows me to iterate sequentially through the file, which is either memory consuming if I read the entire file into memory, or time consuming if I go through the file and discard some values while choosing others. Is there any way to select a random line from the CSV file and read only that line? I attempted the following code, but it was unsuccessful:\n\n```python\nimport csv\n\nwith open('linear_e_LAN2A_F_0_435keV.csv') as file:\n    reader = csv.reader(file)\n    print reader[someRandomInteger]\n```\n\nA sample of the CSV file is as follows:\n\n```python\n331.093,329.735\n251.188,249.994\n374.468,373.782\n295.643,295.159\n83.9058,0\n380.709,116.221\n352.238,351.891\n183.809,182.615\n257.277,201.302\n61.4598,40.7106\n```"

        "content": "To efficiently extract random lines from a large CSV file without loading the entire file into memory, you can use the following approach. This method involves determining the positions of each line in the CSV file and then randomly selecting lines based on these positions. Here's a step-by-step solution using Python:\n\n1. **Count Lines and Store Positions:**\n   First, you need to iterate through the file once to record the positions of each line. This can be done using the `seek()` and `tell()` functions.\n\n2. **Randomly Select Lines:**\n   Use the recorded positions to randomly select and read lines without reading the entire file into memory.\n\nHere is an example code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef get_line_positions(file_path):\n    \"\"\" Get the starting byte position of each line in the CSV file. \"\"\"\n    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:\n        positions = []\n        current_pos = file.tell()\n        line = file.readline()\n        while line:\n            positions.append(current_pos)\n            current_pos = file.tell()\n            line = file.readline()\n    return positions\n\ndef get_random_lines(file_path, positions, num_lines):\n    \"\"\" Fetch random lines from the file based on pre-recorded positions. \"\"\"\n    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:\n        selected_positions = random.sample(positions, num_lines)\n        selected_lines = []\n        for pos in selected_positions:\n            file.seek(pos)\n            selected_lines.append(file.readline().strip())\n    return selected_lines\n\n# Define the path to your CSV file\nfile_path = 'linear_e_LAN2A_F_0_435keV.csv'\n\n# Get the positions of each line\npositions = get_line_positions(file_path)\n\n# Define the number of random lines to extract\nnum_lines_to_extract = 1000000  # adjust this number as needed\n\n# Extract random lines\nrandom_lines = get_random_lines(file_path, positions, num_lines_to_extract)\n\n# Print or process the random lines as needed\nfor line in random_lines:\n    print(line)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`get_line_positions()`**: This function reads the file line-by-line and records the starting byte position of each line.\n- **`get_random_lines()`**: This function selects random positions from the list and retrieves the corresponding lines from the file.\n\n### Considerations:\n- Ensure that the file encoding is correctly set (e.g., `'utf-8'`).\n- Adjust the `num_lines_to_extract` variable to match the number of lines you want to extract.\n- This method assumes that the file is not being modified between the two steps.\n\nBy using this method, you can efficiently extract random lines from a large CSV file without excessive memory usage."
