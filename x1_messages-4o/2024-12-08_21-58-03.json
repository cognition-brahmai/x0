Here's a simple example using SQL to create a database for XYZ school:\n\n### Database: XYZ_School\n\n1. **Students Table**\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE Students (\n    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n    LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n    DateOfBirth DATE,\n    Gender ENUM('Male', 'Female', 'Other'),\n    Address VARCHAR(255),\n    PhoneNumber VARCHAR(15),\n    Email VARCHAR(100),\n    EnrollmentDate DATE\n);\n```\n\n2. **Courses Table**\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE Courses (\n    CourseID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    CourseName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n    CourseDescription TEXT\n);\n```\n\n3. **Enrollments Table**\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE Enrollments (\n    EnrollmentID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    StudentID INT,\n    CourseID INT,\n    EnrollmentDate DATE,\n    FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Students(StudentID),\n    FOREIGN KEY (CourseID) REFERENCES Courses(CourseID)\n);\n```\n\n4. **Teachers Table**\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE Teachers (\n    TeacherID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n    LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n    Subject VARCHAR(100),\n    PhoneNumber VARCHAR(15),\n    Email VARCHAR(100)\n);\n```\n\n5. **Classes Table**\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE Classes (\n    ClassID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    ClassName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n    TeacherID INT,\n    FOREIGN KEY (TeacherID) REFERENCES Teachers(TeacherID)\n);\n```\n\n6. **Class_Enrollments Table**\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE Class_Enrollments (\n    ClassEnrollmentID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\n    StudentID INT,\n    ClassID INT,\n    FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Students(StudentID),\n    FOREIGN KEY (ClassID) REFERENCES Classes(ClassID)\n);\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Students Table**: Stores information about students, including personal details and contact information.\n- **Courses Table**: Stores information about courses available at the school.\n- **Enrollments Table**: Links students to the courses they have enrolled in.\n- **Teachers Table**: Stores information about teachers and their subjects.\n- **Classes Table**: Represents different classes and assigns a teacher to each class.\n- **Class_Enrollments Table**: Links students to the classes they are attending.\n\nThis schema can be expanded or modified to include additional features or requirements, such as attendance records, grades, or extracurricular activities."
