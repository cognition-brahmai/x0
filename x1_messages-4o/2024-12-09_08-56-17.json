Below is a simple example of how you can achieve this using PHP:\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Function to add two numbers\nfunction addNumbers($num1, $num2) {\n    return $num1 + $num2;\n}\n\n// Taking input from the user\necho \"Enter the first number: \";\n$firstNumber = trim(fgets(STDIN));\n\necho \"Enter the second number: \";\n$secondNumber = trim(fgets(STDIN));\n\n// Calculate the sum\n$sum = addNumbers((int)$firstNumber, (int)$secondNumber);\n\n// Output the result\necho \"The sum of $firstNumber and $secondNumber is: $sum\\n\";\n?>\n```\n\nTo run this program:\n\n1. Save the code in a file, say `add_numbers.php`.\n2. Open a terminal or command prompt.\n3. Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.\n4. Run the program by executing `php add_numbers.php`.\n5. Enter the two numbers when prompted, and the program will display their sum. \n\nMake sure you have PHP installed on your machine to execute this script."
