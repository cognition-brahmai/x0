        "content": "The error message you're encountering typically indicates that the package you're trying to install relies on a C extension that needs to be compiled during installation. Python packages that include C extensions require the appropriate C++ compiler to be installed on your system.\n\nHere are some steps you can follow to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify Installation of Build Tools**:\n   - Make sure that you have installed the correct version of the Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools. For Python 3.6, you specifically need Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0.\n   - You can download the Visual Studio Build Tools from the [Visual Studio website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).\n\n2. **Install the Required Components**:\n   - When installing the Build Tools, ensure that the following components are selected:\n     - \"C++ build tools\"\n     - \"Windows 10 SDK\"\n     - \"C++ 2015.3 v140 toolset for desktop\" (this is crucial as it includes the Visual C++ 14.0 compiler)\n\n3. **Check Environment Variables**:\n   - After installation, ensure your system's environment variables are set correctly. You might need to restart your computer to apply changes.\n\n4. **Verify Python Version**:\n   - Make sure your Python version is correctly set up and the `pip` you\u2019re using corresponds to it. You can check this by running:\n     ```bash\n     python --version\n     pip --version\n     ```\n\n5. **Use a Precompiled Wheel**:\n   - If you're still having trouble, you might find a precompiled wheel that you can download and install manually. Check [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) or [Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) for a `.whl` file that matches your Python version and system architecture.\n\n6. **Upgrade `pip` and `setuptools`**:\n   - Sometimes upgrading `pip` and `setuptools` can solve issues with package installation:\n     ```bash\n     python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools\n     ```\n\n7. **Consider an Alternative Package or Version**:\n   - If `misaka` doesn't necessarily need to be installed from source, check if there's an alternative package that might meet your needs and is easier to install.\n\nFollowing these steps should help resolve the issue. If you continue to have problems, consider running the command prompt or PowerShell as an Administrator and try the installation again."
