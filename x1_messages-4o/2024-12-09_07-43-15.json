The error message suggests setting `self.maxDiff` to None to see the full output of the diff, but I'm unsure about how to do this. Could you provide guidance on how to set `self.maxDiff` so I can see the full diff output? Additionally, why does the full diff print to screen when using the same version of nose on Python 2.7.1?\n\nError Message:\n```\n======================================================================\nFAIL: maxdiff2.test_equal\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.3/site-packages/nose/case.py\", line 198, in runTest\n    self.test(*self.arg)\n  File \"/Users/loic/cmrsj/Calculus_II/scrap/maxdiff2.py\", line 32, in test_equal\n    assert_equal(str1, str2)\nAssertionError: 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

        "content": "To address the issue you're encountering with the `maxDiff` attribute in your test case, you need to modify your test function slightly to utilize the `unittest.TestCase` class, which provides the `maxDiff` attribute. You can accomplish this by subclassing `unittest.TestCase` and setting `self.maxDiff` to `None`. This will allow you to see the full diff output when your assertions fail.\n\nHere's how you can modify your script:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\n\nclass TestStringMethods(unittest.TestCase):\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Set maxDiff to None to see the full diff output\n        self.maxDiff = None\n\n    def test_equal(self):\n        str1 = \"\"\"Lorem ipsum...\"\"\"\n        str2 = \"\"\"Suspendisse lectus...\"\"\"\n        self.assertEqual(str1, str2)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Subclass `unittest.TestCase`:** Create a new class `TestStringMethods` that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. This is necessary to use the `maxDiff` attribute.\n\n2. **Set `self.maxDiff`:** In the `setUp` method, set `self.maxDiff` to `None`. This ensures that the full diff is shown when the assertion fails.\n\n3. **Use `self.assertEqual`:** Replace `assert_equal` with `self.assertEqual` since you're now using `unittest.TestCase`.\n\n### Why the Difference in Behavior?\n\n- **Python 2.7 vs Python 3.3:** The difference in behavior between Python 2.7.1 and Python 3.3.0 with `nose` could be due to changes in the `unittest` module itself or how `nose` interacts with it. The `unittest` module in Python 3 provides better support for more detailed diff outputs and configurable diff lengths compared to older versions.\n\n- **`nose` Behavior:** The `nose` testing framework relies on Python's `unittest` module for many of its functionalities. Changes in the underlying `unittest` module between different Python versions can result in different behaviors when running tests with `nose`.\n\nBy using `unittest.TestCase` and setting `self.maxDiff`, you ensure that your tests are portable across different Python versions and you can see the full diff output when tests fail."
