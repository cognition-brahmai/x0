How do they differ in languages where they are not considered \"first-class\"? Also, when one says \"everything is an object\" (like in Python), does that mean \"everything is first-class\"?"

The concept of \"first-class\" objects in programming is an important one, often tied to the flexibility and power of a programming language.\n\n### What are \"First-Class\" Objects?\n\nIn programming, when we say something is \"first-class,\" we're referring to entities that can be treated uniformly throughout the language. Specifically, first-class objects can:\n\n1. **Be Passed as Arguments**: You can pass them as arguments to functions or methods.\n2. **Be Returned from Functions**: Functions can return them as values.\n3. **Be Assigned to Variables**: You can assign them to variables.\n4. **Be Stored in Data Structures**: They can be stored in structures like lists, dictionaries, etc.\n5. **Be Created at Runtime**: You can create new instances of them at runtime.\n\n### When are Objects Referred to as \"First-Class\"?\n\nAn object or entity is referred to as \"first-class\" in a programming language if it satisfies all the conditions mentioned above. The term \"first-class\" often highlights the ability of the language to handle certain elements with the same flexibility as other fundamental types like integers or strings.\n\n### Difference in Languages Where They Are Not Considered \"First-Class\"\n\nIn languages where certain entities are not first-class, you may encounter restrictions such as:\n\n- **Limited Functionality**: You might not be able to pass certain entities as arguments or return them from functions.\n- **Special Syntax or Rules**: You may need special syntax or face limitations when working with these non-first-class entities, such as not being able to assign them to variables directly.\n- **Reduced Flexibility**: The lack of first-class status can limit how you use these entities, reducing the expressiveness and flexibility of the language.\n\n### \"Everything is an Object\" in Python\n\nWhen it's said that \"everything is an object\" in Python, it means that all data types in Python (including integers, strings, functions, and even classes) are implemented as objects. This does imply that they are first-class citizens in Python because you can pass them around, return them from functions, assign them to variables, and so forth.\n\nHowever, while everything being an object means they have a consistent interface and behavior, it doesn't necessarily mean every object is first-class in the same way. Some objects might have restrictions or additional properties, but generally in Python, most types are designed to be first-class.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe idea of first-class objects allows for powerful programming paradigms such as functional programming and promotes greater abstraction and modularity. Python, with its philosophy of \"everything is an object,\" embraces first-class objects, providing developers with a flexible and expressive language."
