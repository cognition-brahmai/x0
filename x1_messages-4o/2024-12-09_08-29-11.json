I've tried `if myList is not None:` and `if myList is not []:`, but neither are working. What is the correct way to check if a list is empty in Python?"

        "content": "In Python, to check if a list is empty, you can simply use a conditional statement that evaluates the list directly, as an empty list evaluates to `False` in a boolean context. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nmyList = []\n\nif not myList:\n    print(\"The list is empty.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The list is not empty.\")\n```\n\nThis approach is both concise and Pythonic. The expression `not myList` will be `True` if `myList` is an empty list (`[]`), and `False` if it contains any elements. You should avoid using expressions like `if myList is not []:` because it checks for identity, not equality, and can lead to unexpected results."
