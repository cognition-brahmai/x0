        "content": "Yes, you can suppress these informational messages from TensorFlow, which are sometimes not necessary once you've confirmed that your setup is working correctly. By default, TensorFlow logs messages with a severity level of INFO and above. You can change the logging level to suppress INFO messages and only show WARNING and ERROR messages.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Set the Logging Level Using Environment Variables:**\n\n   You can set the `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to control the verbosity of the logs. The levels are defined as follows:\n   - `0` = all logs (default setting)\n   - `1` = filter out INFO logs\n   - `2` = filter out INFO and WARNING logs\n   - `3` = filter out all logs except ERROR\n\n   To suppress INFO messages, you can set this variable to `1`.\n\n   If you are using a command line, you can set this variable before running your script:\n\n   ```bash\n   export TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=1\n   ```\n\n   For Windows, you can set it using:\n\n   ```cmd\n   set TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=1\n   ```\n\n2. **Set the Logging Level Within Your Script:**\n\n   You can also set this environment variable within your Python script before importing TensorFlow:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '1'\n   import tensorflow as tf\n   ```\n\nBy setting the `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `1`, you will suppress all the INFO messages, and you should only see warnings and errors. This should help in making your logs more readable."
