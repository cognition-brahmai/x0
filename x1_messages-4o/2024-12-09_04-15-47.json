I am trying to anchor a date (for example, today) and get a unix timestamp (epoch time) for 8pm and 11pm in Pacific Standard Time (PST) only. However, even though I am setting up a timezone and creating the datetime with that timezone, it seems to be created as UTC and then converted. Here's the code I am using:\n\n```\npacific = pytz.timezone(\"US/Pacific\")\ndatetime(2011,2,11,20,0,0,0,pacific)\ndatetime(2011,2,11,20,0,0,0,pacific).strftime(\"%s\")\n```\n\nThe result I get is: \n\n```\ndatetime.datetime(2011, 2, 11, 20, 0, tzinfo=<DstTzInfo 'US/Pacific' PST-1 day, 16:00:0 STD>)\n'1297454400'\nFri Feb 11 12:00:00 PST 2011 (when converted using 'date -d '@1297454400'')\n```\n\nThis becomes a problem when UTC is a day ahead, and I am trying to do the calculations. Is there a way to generate a timestamp for 8pm PST today without involving UTC?"

        "content": "To ensure that your Python code is handling timezones correctly and giving you the desired Unix timestamp for 8 PM and 11 PM in Pacific Standard Time (PST), you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create the naive datetime object**: First, create a naive datetime object with the desired time.\n2. **Localize the datetime**: Use the `localize` method provided by `pytz` to associate the naive datetime with the Pacific timezone.\n3. **Convert to Unix timestamp**: Finally, convert this timezone-aware datetime to a Unix timestamp.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport pytz\n\n# Define the timezone\npacific = pytz.timezone(\"US/Pacific\")\n\n# Create a naive datetime object for 8 PM and 11 PM\nnaive_8pm = datetime(2011, 2, 11, 20, 0, 0)\nnaive_11pm = datetime(2011, 2, 11, 23, 0, 0)\n\n# Localize the naive datetime to the Pacific timezone\nlocalized_8pm = pacific.localize(naive_8pm)\nlocalized_11pm = pacific.localize(naive_11pm)\n\n# Convert to Unix timestamp\ntimestamp_8pm = int(localized_8pm.timestamp())\ntimestamp_11pm = int(localized_11pm.timestamp())\n\nprint(\"8 PM PST Unix timestamp:\", timestamp_8pm)\nprint(\"11 PM PST Unix timestamp:\", timestamp_11pm)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Naive vs. Aware Datetime**: A naive datetime object has no timezone information. When you create a datetime object without specifying a timezone, it's considered naive. Localizing it with `pytz` makes it timezone-aware.\n- **Avoid Direct Conversion**: Using `strftime(\"%s\")` is not reliable for timezone-aware datetimes, as it may not handle timezone offsets correctly. Instead, use the `timestamp()` method on a timezone-aware datetime object to get the correct Unix timestamp.\n- **Unix Timestamp**: This is always in UTC. When you convert a timezone-aware datetime to a Unix timestamp, it automatically accounts for the timezone offset.\n\nThis approach ensures you're working with the correct timezone information from the start, avoiding any conversions that might misinterpret the time as UTC."
