I have initially created the button in the DISABLED state using the following code:\n```\nself.x = Button(self.dialog, text=\"Download\", state=DISABLED,\n                command=self.download).pack(side=LEFT)\n```"

        "content": "To change the state of a Tkinter button from `DISABLED` to `NORMAL` upon a certain event, you need to have a reference to the button widget so you can modify its state later. In your current code, `self.x` is assigned the result of the `pack()` method, which is `None`. To keep a reference to the button, you should separate the creation of the button and the packing of it. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nself.x = Button(self.dialog, text=\"Download\", state=DISABLED, command=self.download)\nself.x.pack(side=LEFT)\n```\n\nThen, in the event handler where you want to change the button state, you can update the state like this:\n\n```python\ndef some_event_handler(self):\n    # Your event handling code\n    self.x.config(state=NORMAL)\n```\n\nEnsure that the `some_event_handler` method is bound to the event that you are interested in. For example, if you want to enable the button when a checkbox is checked or an entry field is filled, you'll have to bind `some_event_handler` to the appropriate event.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how you might bind this to a button click event:\n\n```python\nself.some_other_button = Button(self.dialog, text=\"Enable Download\", command=self.some_event_handler)\nself.some_other_button.pack(side=LEFT)\n```\n\nThis way, when `some_other_button` is pressed, `some_event_handler` will be called and it will enable the `Download` button."
