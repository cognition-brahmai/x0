The issue is related to the \"socket.gaierror\" that I am getting at runtime. Here is the code I am trying to run:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nfrom socket import *\nfrom time import ctime\n\nHOST = ' '\nPORT = 21567\nBUFSIZ = 1024\nADDR = (HOST, PORT)\n\ntcpSerSock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)\ntcpSerSock.bind(ADDR)\ntcpSerSock.listen(5)\n\nwhile True:\n    print 'waiting for connection...'\n    tcpCliSock, addr = tcpSerSock.accept()\n    print \"...connected from:\", addr\n\n    while True:\n        data = tcpCliSock.recv(BUFSIZ)\n        if not data:\n            break\n        tcpCliSock.send(\"[%s] %s\" % (ctime(), data))\n\ntcpCliSock.close()\ntcpSerSock.close()\n```\n\nBut while running, it is throwing an error at the line \"tcpSerSock.bind(ADDR)\". The error stack trace is as follows:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"tsTserv.py\", line 12, in <module>\n    tcpSerSock.bind(ADDR)\n  File \"/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/socket.py\", line 224, in meth\nsocket.gaierror: [Errno 8] nodename nor servname provided, or not known\n```\n\nCan you help me understand what this error means and how I can resolve it?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering, `socket.gaierror: [Errno 8] nodename nor servname provided, or not known`, indicates that there's an issue with the host address you're using for the socket binding. In your code, the `HOST` variable is set to a space `' '`, which is not a valid address. Instead, you should use an empty string `''` to mean \"all available interfaces\" or the specific IP address of your machine.\n\nHere's how you can resolve the issue:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nfrom socket import *\nfrom time import ctime\n\nHOST = ''  # Listen on all available interfaces\nPORT = 21567\nBUFSIZ = 1024\nADDR = (HOST, PORT)\n\ntcpSerSock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)\ntcpSerSock.bind(ADDR)\ntcpSerSock.listen(5)\n\nwhile True:\n    print('waiting for connection...')\n    tcpCliSock, addr = tcpSerSock.accept()\n    print(\"...connected from:\", addr)\n\n    while True:\n        data = tcpCliSock.recv(BUFSIZ)\n        if not data:\n            break\n        tcpCliSock.send(\"[%s] %s\" % (ctime(), data))\n\ntcpCliSock.close()\ntcpSerSock.close()\n```\n\nAdditionally, please note that the `print` statements in Python 3 require parentheses. If you are using Python 2.7 as indicated in the error trace, your original `print` statements without parentheses would work correctly.\n\nMake sure that no other process is using the specified port (21567 in this case) when you run this server. If the port is already in use, you'll need to either free it or choose a different port number.\n\nAfter making these changes, try running your script again. This should resolve the `gaierror` you were encountering."
