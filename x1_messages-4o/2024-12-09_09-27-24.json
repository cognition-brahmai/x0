        "content": "To shuffle a list of numbers using random indices in Python, you can use the `random` module to generate random indices and rearrange the elements accordingly. Here is a simple script that demonstrates how to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef shuffle_list(numbers):\n    # Create a copy of the original list to avoid modifying it\n    shuffled = numbers[:]\n    \n    # Get the length of the list\n    n = len(shuffled)\n    \n    # Shuffle the list using random indices\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Generate a random index between i and the end of the list\n        j = random.randint(i, n - 1)\n        \n        # Swap the elements at indices i and j\n        shuffled[i], shuffled[j] = shuffled[j], shuffled[i]\n    \n    return shuffled\n\n# Example usage\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nshuffled_numbers = shuffle_list(numbers)\nprint(\"Original list:\", numbers)\nprint(\"Shuffled list:\", shuffled_numbers)\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `shuffle_list` that takes a list of numbers as input, shuffles it using random swaps, and returns the shuffled list. The original list remains unchanged. The function iteratively swaps each element with another randomly chosen element from the remaining part of the list."
