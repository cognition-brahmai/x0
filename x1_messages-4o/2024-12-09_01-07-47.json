The code hangs in different parts of the process and doesn't update the progress bar properly. For example, this simple PyGTK progressbar example works fine, but after converting it to PyGObject introspection, it hangs and fails to update the progress bar properly. Additionally, I've tried to import GLib through introspection and then run GLib.thread_init(), but I encounter an error. Is this because the extra threading libraries weren't linked, and if so, how can I work with GLib as if those libraries have been linked?\n\n```python\nimport threading\nimport random, time\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk, Gdk\n#Initializing the gtk's thread engine\nGdk.threads_init()\n\nclass FractionSetter(threading.Thread):\n    \"\"\"This class sets the fraction of the progressbar\"\"\"\n    stopthread = threading.Event()\n\n    def run(self):\n        global progressbar \n        while not self.stopthread.isSet() :\n            Gdk.threads_enter()\n            progressbar.set_fraction(random.random())\n            Gdk.threads_leave()\n            time.sleep(0.1)\n\n    def stop(self):\n        self.stopthread.set()\n\ndef main_quit(obj):\n    global fs\n    fs.stop()\n    Gtk.main_quit()\n\nwindow = Gtk.Window()\nprogressbar = Gtk.ProgressBar()\nwindow.add(progressbar)\nwindow.show_all()\nwindow.connect('destroy', main_quit)\n\nfs = FractionSetter()\nfs.start()\n\nGtk.main()\n```\n\nError:\n```python\n>>> from gi.repository import GLib\n>>> GLib.thread_init(None)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/gi/types.py\", line 44, in function\n    return info.invoke(*args)\nglib.GError: Could not locate g_thread_init: `g_thread_init': /usr/lib/libglib-2.0.so.0: undefined symbol: g_thread_init\n```"

        "content": "The transition from PyGTK to PyGObject can be a bit challenging, especially when dealing with threading. Here are some key points and suggestions to address the issues you're encountering:\n\n1. **Threading in GLib and GDK:**\n   - PyGObject and GLib have evolved, and the need for explicitly initializing threads using `Gdk.threads_init()` or `GLib.thread_init()` is no longer necessary or supported. GLib now handles threading internally.\n   - The `g_thread_init()` function has been deprecated and removed in GLib 2.32. Since then, GLib automatically initializes its threading system, so you don't need to do this manually.\n\n2. **Updating the UI from a Thread:**\n   - Directly updating GTK widgets from a non-main thread is not safe. Instead, you should use `GLib.idle_add()` to schedule updates to the UI from the main thread. This function ensures that the updates are performed in the GTK main loop.\n   \n3. **Refactoring Your Code:**\n   - Remove the `Gdk.threads_enter()` and `Gdk.threads_leave()`. Instead, use `GLib.idle_add()` to update the GUI from your thread.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport threading\nimport random, time\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk, GLib\n\nclass FractionSetter(threading.Thread):\n    \"\"\"This class sets the fraction of the progressbar\"\"\"\n    stopthread = threading.Event()\n\n    def run(self):\n        while not self.stopthread.isSet():\n            # Schedule the UI update in the main thread\n            GLib.idle_add(self.update_progress)\n            time.sleep(0.1)\n\n    def update_progress(self):\n        progressbar.set_fraction(random.random())\n        return False  # returns False to remove the idle callback\n\n    def stop(self):\n        self.stopthread.set()\n\ndef main_quit(obj):\n    fs.stop()\n    Gtk.main_quit()\n\nwindow = Gtk.Window()\nprogressbar = Gtk.ProgressBar()\nwindow.add(progressbar)\nwindow.show_all()\nwindow.connect('destroy', main_quit)\n\nfs = FractionSetter()\nfs.start()\n\nGtk.main()\n```\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n- **Python GIL:** Remember that the Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can affect multi-threaded programs. If you find performance issues, consider using multiprocessing or other asynchronous libraries to manage concurrent tasks.\n\n- **Error Handling:** Make sure to handle exceptions properly in your threads to avoid silent failures.\n\n- **Python Version Compatibility:** Ensure that you are using a compatible version of Python and PyGObject for your system.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you should be able to resolve the issues with your progress bar and threading in your PyGObject application."
