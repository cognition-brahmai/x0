        "content": "Saving a scikit-learn pipeline that includes a `KerasRegressor` directly using `joblib` can be problematic due to the way TensorFlow objects are handled, which can lead to recursion errors. Instead of saving the entire pipeline directly, you can save the Keras model separately and then reconstruct the pipeline when you need to load it.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to save and load your pipeline:\n\n### Saving the Pipeline\n\n1. **Save the Scikit-learn components**: You can save the parts of the pipeline that are compatible with `joblib` separately.\n\n2. **Save the Keras model**: Use Keras's built-in model saving functionality to save the Keras model.\n\n```python\nfrom keras.models import save_model\nimport joblib\n\n# Train your pipeline\npipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Extract the trained Keras model\nkeras_model = pipeline.named_steps['mlp'].model\n\n# Save the Keras model\nkeras_model.save('keras_model.h5')\n\n# Remove the Keras model from the pipeline\npipeline.named_steps['mlp'].model = None\n\n# Save the rest of the pipeline\njoblib.dump(pipeline, 'pipeline_without_keras.pkl', compress=9)\n```\n\n### Loading the Pipeline\n\n1. **Load the Scikit-learn components**: Load the saved pipeline without the Keras model.\n\n2. **Load the Keras model**: Load the Keras model separately and set it back into the pipeline.\n\n```python\nfrom keras.models import load_model\nimport joblib\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n# Load the rest of the pipeline\npipeline = joblib.load('pipeline_without_keras.pkl')\n\n# Load the Keras model\nkeras_model = load_model('keras_model.h5')\n\n# Assign the loaded Keras model back to the pipeline\npipeline.named_steps['mlp'].model = keras_model\n```\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Custom Objects**: If you have custom objects in your Keras model (e.g., custom layers or metrics), you'll need to handle them appropriately using the `custom_objects` parameter in `load_model`.\n\n- **TensorFlow Session**: If you encounter issues with session management in TensorFlow, ensure that the Keras backend is correctly set up. You might need to reset the session using `tf.keras.backend.clear_session()` before loading the model.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively save and load your pipeline without encountering recursion errors."
