        "content": "In Python, when you're checking if a variable is not equal to `None`, the preferred way is to use `if x is not None`. This is considered more readable and idiomatic in Python. \n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Readability**: `if x is not None` is more straightforward and immediately communicates the intent that you're checking whether `x` is not `None`. It aligns with the natural language and is easier for most people to read and understand.\n\n2. **Functionality**: Both `if x is not None` and `if not x is None` will work correctly and produce the same result in this specific context because the `is` operator checks for identity, not equality. However, `if not x is None` can be slightly confusing because it requires mentally parsing the negation before the expression.\n\n3. **Performance**: There is no significant performance difference between the two expressions. The difference, if any, would be negligible and not noticeable in practical applications.\n\n4. **Other Singletons**: If you're checking against other singletons (like `True`, `False`, or custom singletons), the same reasoning applies. Use `is not` for readability and clarity.\n\nIn conclusion, prefer `if x is not None` for clarity and readability. It is the Pythonic way to handle such checks and aligns with the community's best practices."
