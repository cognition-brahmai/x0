It strips out whitespace, punctuation, and numbers from the input strings, counts the number of common characters, and returns the result in a LaTeX table format. This function is designed to handle multiple languages and character sets.\n\n```python\nimport string\nimport re\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef common_characters(str1, str2):\n    # Remove whitespaces, punctuation, and numbers\n    regex_pattern = r'[^\\w\\s]|_|\\d'\n    cleaned_str1 = re.sub(regex_pattern, '', str1)\n    cleaned_str2 = re.sub(regex_pattern, '', str2)\n\n    # Convert strings to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity\n    cleaned_str1 = cleaned_str1.lower()\n    cleaned_str2 = cleaned_str2.lower()\n\n    # Count occurrences of each character in both strings\n    counter1 = Counter(cleaned_str1)\n    counter2 = Counter(cleaned_str2)\n\n    # Find common characters\n    common_chars = counter1 & counter2\n    num_common_chars = sum(common_chars.values())\n\n    # Create LaTeX table\n    latex_table = f\"\"\"\n    \\\\begin{{table}}[h]\n    \\\\centering\n    \\\\begin{{tabular}}{{|c|c|}}\n    \\\\hline\n    \\\\textbf{{String 1}} & \\\\textbf{{String 2}} \\\\\\\\\n    \\\\hline\n    {str1[:50]}... & {str2[:50]}... \\\\\\\\\n    \\\\hline\n    \\\\textbf{{Common Characters}} & {num_common_chars} \\\\\\\\\n    \\\\hline\n    \\\\end{{tabular}}\n    \\\\caption{{Number of common characters between the two strings}}\n    \\\\end{{table}}\n    \"\"\"\n    return latex_table\n\n# Example usage with SQL format input\nsql_input = \"\"\"\n    SELECT 'This is a long string of at least 1000 characters...'
