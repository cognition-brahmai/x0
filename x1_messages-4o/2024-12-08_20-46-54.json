        "content": "In cosmology, the density parameter for dark matter, often denoted as \\(\\Omega_{\\text{DM}}\\), is defined in relation to the critical density of the universe, \\(\\rho_c\\). The critical density is the energy density needed for the universe to be flat and is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\rho_c = \\frac{3H_0^2}{8\\pi G}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(H_0\\) is the Hubble constant and \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant.\n\nThe density parameter for dark matter, \\(\\Omega_{\\text{DM}}\\), is then expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\Omega_{\\text{DM}} = \\frac{\\rho_{\\text{DM}}}{\\rho_c}\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\rho_{\\text{DM}}\\) is the actual density of dark matter in the universe.\n\nThis equation supports the existence of dark matter because observations, such as galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, and cosmic microwave background measurements, indicate that the total matter density of the universe exceeds the density of visible baryonic matter. When scientists calculate \\(\\Omega_{\\text{DM}}\\) using these observations, they find it to be significantly greater than zero, implying the presence of non-luminous matter, consistent with the concept of dark matter."
