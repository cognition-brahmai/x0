What could be the cause of this error and how can I fix it?"

        "content": "This issue might be caused by differences in the environment configurations between your terminal and PyCharm. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the problem:\n\n1. **Check Matplotlib Version:**\n   Ensure that the version of Matplotlib you are using is the same in both environments. You can check the version by running:\n   ```python\n   import matplotlib\n   print(matplotlib.__version__)\n   ```\n   in both the terminal and PyCharm. If they are different, you may need to update or downgrade Matplotlib to match the version that works.\n\n2. **Verify Python Interpreter:**\n   Make sure that PyCharm is using the same Python interpreter as your terminal. You can check this in PyCharm by going to `File > Settings > Project: YourProjectName > Python Interpreter`. Ensure that the interpreter path matches the one you are using in the terminal.\n\n3. **Check for Custom Imports:**\n   Ensure that there aren't any custom modules or scripts named `matplotlib.py` in your project directory that may be shadowing the actual Matplotlib module. This can sometimes cause unexpected behavior.\n\n4. **Update Code:**\n   Recent versions of Matplotlib have removed or changed some attributes and features. If your code relies on older features like `matplotlib.verbose`, you might need to refactor your code to comply with the newer API. Check the Matplotlib documentation for alternatives or updates.\n\n5. **Reinstall Matplotlib:**\n   If the above steps do not resolve the issue, try reinstalling Matplotlib. You can do this using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall matplotlib\n   pip install matplotlib\n   ```\n\n6. **Environment Variables:**\n   Check if there are any specific environment variables or settings defined in your terminal session that are not present in PyCharm. You can define these in PyCharm by going to `Run > Edit Configurations` and setting them under the `Environment Variables` section.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the inconsistency between the terminal and PyCharm regarding the 'matplotlib' module."
