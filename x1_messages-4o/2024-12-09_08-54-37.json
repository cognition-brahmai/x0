        "content": "To calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the lengths of the other two sides, you can use the Pythagorean theorem. The theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse \\( c \\) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). Mathematically, it's expressed as:\n\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\]\n\nTo find the length of the hypotenuse \\( c \\), you can rearrange the formula to solve for \\( c \\):\n\n\\[ c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\]\n\nHere's a Python function that implements this calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_hypotenuse(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle given sides a and b.\"\"\"\n    return math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)\n\n# Example usage:\nside_a = 3\nside_b = 4\nhypotenuse = calculate_hypotenuse(side_a, side_b)\nprint(f\"The hypotenuse is: {hypotenuse}\")\n```\n\nIn this function:\n- We import the `math` module to use the `sqrt` function, which computes the square root.\n- The function `calculate_hypotenuse` takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, which represent the lengths of the two sides of the triangle.\n- The function returns the length of the hypotenuse by calculating the square root of the sum of the squares of `a` and `b`.\n- In the example usage, the function is called with sides of lengths 3 and 4, and it prints the hypotenuse. For this example, the hypotenuse should be 5."
