Typically, it is used as a noun, but it can also be used as a verb in less common cases. Here are examples of each:\n\n1. **As a Noun:**\n   - Sentence: \"We will meet at the church on Sunday.\"\n   - Tagging Output: \"We/PRP will/MD meet/VB at/IN the/DT church/NN on/IN Sunday/NNP.\"\n\n2. **As a Verb (less common usage):**\n   - Sentence: \"They church their sheep every spring.\"\n   - Tagging Output: \"They/PRP church/VB their/PRP$ sheep/NNS every/DT spring/NN.\"\n\nIn the first example, \"church\" is tagged as a noun (NN), while in the second example, it is tagged as a verb (VB). The context of the sentence determines the part of speech tagging."
