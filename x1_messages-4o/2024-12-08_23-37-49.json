If the boolean is `True`, it returns a new list where each integer is multiplied by the scalar. If the boolean is `False`, it returns the original list.\n\n```python\ndef multiply_list_with_scalar(int_list, scalar, should_multiply):\n    \"\"\"\n    Multiplies each integer in the list by the given scalar if should_multiply is True.\n    Otherwise, returns the original list.\n    \n    :param int_list: List of integers to be processed.\n    :param scalar: The scalar value to multiply with each integer.\n    :param should_multiply: Boolean value to determine whether to perform multiplication.\n    :return: A new list with multiplied values or the original list.\n    \"\"\"\n    if should_multiply:\n        return [x * scalar for x in int_list]\n    else:\n        return int_list\n\n# Example usage:\noriginal_list = [2, 4, 6]\nscalar = 3\nshould_multiply = True\n\nresult = multiply_list_with_scalar(original_list, scalar, should_multiply)\nprint(result)  # Output: [6, 12, 18]\n```\n\nThis function performs the task as specified, ensuring that the original list is returned unchanged if the boolean value is `False`."
