Please provide the necessary formula and example code.\nAlso, could you please provide a sample Swift code for generating a resignation letter for an employee like Joe Smith? The letter should include standard elements such as the employee's name, job title, resignation date, and a message expressing gratitude to the company."

        "content": "To calculate the length of service for an employee in Swift, you can use the `Calendar` and `DateComponents` classes to compute the difference between the hire date and resignation date. Below is an example of how you might do this:\n\n### Swift Code to Calculate Length of Service\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nfunc calculateLengthOfService(hireDate: Date, resignationDate: Date) -> DateComponents {\n    let calendar = Calendar.current\n    let components = calendar.dateComponents([.year, .month, .day], from: hireDate, to: resignationDate)\n    return components\n}\n\n// Example usage\nlet dateFormatter = DateFormatter()\ndateFormatter.dateFormat = \"yyyy-MM-dd\"\n\nif let hireDate = dateFormatter.date(from: \"2015-06-01\"),\n   let resignationDate = dateFormatter.date(from: \"2023-10-15\") {\n    let lengthOfService = calculateLengthOfService(hireDate: hireDate, resignationDate: resignationDate)\n    print(\"Years: \\(lengthOfService.year ?? 0), Months: \\(lengthOfService.month ?? 0), Days: \\(lengthOfService.day ?? 0)\")\n}\n```\n\n### Sample Swift Code for a Resignation Letter\n\nHere's how you can generate a resignation letter for an employee:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nstruct Employee {\n    let name: String\n    let jobTitle: String\n    let resignationDate: Date\n}\n\nfunc generateResignationLetter(for employee: Employee) -> String {\n    let dateFormatter = DateFormatter()\n    dateFormatter.dateStyle = .long\n    let formattedDate = dateFormatter.string(from: employee.resignationDate)\n    \n    return \"\"\"\n    Dear [Manager's Name],\n\n    I am writing to formally announce my resignation from my position as \\(employee.jobTitle) at [Company Name], effective \\(formattedDate).\n\n    I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at [Company Name] and am grateful for the opportunities for personal and professional growth that have been provided to me. I am thankful to have had the chance to work with such a talented team and appreciate all the support and guidance during my tenure.\n\n    Please let me know how I can assist during the transition period. I wish [Company Name] continued success in the future.\n\n    Sincerely,\n    \\(employee.name)\n    \"\"\"\n}\n\n// Example usage\nlet employee = Employee(name: \"Joe Smith\", jobTitle: \"Software Engineer\", resignationDate: Date())\nlet resignationLetter = generateResignationLetter(for: employee)\nprint(resignationLetter)\n```\n\nIn these examples, I've created functions for calculating the length of service and generating a resignation letter. You can modify these as needed to fit your specific requirements, such as changing `Manager's Name` and `Company Name` in the resignation letter."
