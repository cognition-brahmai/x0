        "content": "I am trying to train a CNN architecture for a regression problem using PyTorch, where my output is a tensor of 20 values. I planned to use RMSE as my loss function and attempted to use PyTorch's nn.MSELoss() and took the square root for it using torch.sqrt(). However, I am confused by the results. For a batch-size bs, my output tensor's dimensions would be [bs , 20]. I tried to implement an RMSE function on my own using the following code:\n\n```python\ndef loss_function (predicted_x , target ):\n    loss = torch.sum(torch.square(predicted_x - target) , axis= 1)/(predicted_x.size()[1]) #Taking the mean of all the squares by dividing it with the number of outputs i.e 20 in my case\n    loss = torch.sqrt(loss)\n    loss = torch.sum(loss)/predicted_x.size()[0]  #averaging out by batch-size\n    return loss\n```\n\nBut the output of my loss_function() and how PyTorch implements it with nn.MSELoss() differed. I'm unsure whether my implementation is incorrect or if I'm using nn.MSELoss() improperly. Could you help me understand where I'm going wrong?"

        "content": "The issue might be related to how the mean and the square root are applied differently in your custom implementation compared to the standard usage of `nn.MSELoss()`. Let's break down the steps in your custom RMSE function and compare them with how you might use `nn.MSELoss()` to achieve RMSE.\n\n### Custom RMSE Implementation\n\nIn your custom loss function:\n\n1. **Square the difference**: `torch.square(predicted_x - target)`\n2. **Mean along the axis**: You are computing the mean along the axis where your output has 20 values.\n3. **Square Root**: You take the square root of this mean to get RMSE for each sample.\n4. **Mean over batch**: You then take the average over the batch size.\n\n### Using `nn.MSELoss`\n\nTo use `nn.MSELoss()` for RMSE:\n\n1. Compute MSE using `nn.MSELoss`:\n   ```python\n   mse_loss = nn.MSELoss(reduction='mean')\n   mse = mse_loss(predicted_x, target)\n   ```\n2. Take the square root of the MSE to get RMSE:\n   ```python\n   rmse = torch.sqrt(mse)\n   ```\n\n### Differences and Considerations\n\n1. **Reduction**: Ensure that the reduction in `nn.MSELoss` is set to `'mean'` so that it computes the mean over all elements. If you want to compute RMSE per sample and then average over the batch, you might need to use `reduction='none'` and then manually compute the mean.\n\n2. **Mean Calculation**: In your custom function, you compute the mean for each sample separately before taking the square root. This means you are computing RMSE per sample and then averaging it. In contrast, `nn.MSELoss` with `reduction='mean'` computes a global mean before you take the square root.\n\n3. **Batch-wise Mean**: If you wish to replicate your custom function exactly, you should ensure that the MSE is computed per sample first and then averaged after taking the square root.\n\nHere is an adjusted function to match the logic of your custom implementation using PyTorch's built-in functions:\n\n```python\ndef rmse_loss(predicted_x, target):\n    mse_loss = (predicted_x - target) ** 2\n    mse_loss_per_sample = mse_loss.mean(dim=1)  # Mean over the 20 outputs\n    rmse_per_sample = torch.sqrt(mse_loss_per_sample)  # RMSE per sample\n    rmse = rmse_per_sample.mean()  # Average over batch size\n    return rmse\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nEnsure consistency between the dimensionality and reduction strategies used in your custom implementation and PyTorch's built-in loss functions. The difference in results likely stems from how the mean is calculated and applied in your custom function versus the built-in MSE loss function."
