        "content": "The problem you are describing involves calculating the total amount of coconut you consume over a week and then determining how much to eat each day to ensure no wastage. Let's break down the solution.\n\n### Calculating Total Amount of Coconut\n\nYou correctly identified that you need to add up the fractions of coconut you eat each day:\n\n- Day 1: 1/2 coconut\n- Day 2: 1/3 coconut\n- Day 3: 1/4 coconut\n- ...\n- Day 7: 1/8 coconut\n\nHowever, your loop starts from 2 and goes to 7, which means you are missing the 1/8 for the 7th day. Let's correct this calculation:\n\n```javascript\nlet totalCoconut = 0.5; // For the first day\n\nfor (let i = 3; i <= 8; i++) { // Start loop from 3 to include 1/3 to 1/8\n  totalCoconut += 1/i;\n}\n\nconsole.log(\"Total coconut:\", totalCoconut);\n```\n\n### Distributing Coconut Equally Over 7 Days\n\nOnce you have the total amount, you can divide it by 7 to get the amount you should aim to eat each day. You are correct in your approach to divide the total coconut by 7:\n\n```javascript\nlet coconutPerDay = totalCoconut / 7;\nconsole.log(\"Coconut per day:\", coconutPerDay);\n```\n\n### Summary\n\n1. Calculate the total amount of coconut you will eat over 7 days by summing up the fractions from 1/2 to 1/8.\n2. Divide the total by 7 to get the daily amount needed to avoid wastage.\n\nThis approach ensures you have enough coconut each day without any wastage at the end of the week. I hope this helps!"
