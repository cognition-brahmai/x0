        "content": "You can achieve this by using the multiplication operator for lists in Python, which allows you to repeat elements. Here's how you can create multiple lists of varying lengths, each containing the element 'e' repeated 'n' times, without using list comprehension:\n\n```python\ndef create_lists(lengths, item):\n    lists = []\n    for n in lengths:\n        lists.append([item] * n)\n    return lists\n\n# Example usage:\nlengths = [3, 5, 2]  # Example list of lengths\nitem = 'e'            # The item to repeat\nresult = create_lists(lengths, item)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `create_lists` takes a list of lengths and an item to repeat. It uses a loop to iterate over the lengths and creates a list with the specified item repeated 'n' times using the multiplication operator `[item] * n`. This avoids the use of list comprehension."
