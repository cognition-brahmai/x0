        "content": "Is it incorrect to use the \"==\" operator for comparison with an empty list in Python? I am using PyCharm (4.0.6) and it complains when I do a comparison to an empty list using the \"==\" operator, but not when I use the \"is\" operator. However, when I use the \"is\" operator, it seems to return a false negative. Here is a simple example in iPython shell:\n\n```python\nIn[2]: actions = []\nIn[3]: actions == []\nOut[3]: True\nIn[4]: actions is []\nOut[4]: False\n```\n\nI suspect this issue is related to PEP 8. Could someone please explain why PyCharm complains about the \"==\" operator when comparing to empty lists? Am I doing something wrong according to PEP 8?"

        "content": "The behavior you're observing is related to the nuances of comparisons and identity checks in Python, as well as PEP 8, which is the style guide for Python code.\n\n1. **`==` Operator**: This operator is used to compare the equality of the values of two objects. In your example, `actions == []` checks whether the list `actions` has the same contents as an empty list. Since `actions` is also an empty list, the comparison returns `True`.\n\n2. **`is` Operator**: This operator checks whether two references point to the same object in memory, not if their contents are equal. In your example, `actions is []` returns `False` because `actions` and `[]` are two separate list objects in memory, even though they both are empty.\n\n3. **PyCharm Warning and PEP 8**: PyCharm might be warning you because using `is` for value comparison is incorrect. PEP 8 advises using `==` for equality checks, not `is`. The `is` operator should be used for checking identity, like `is None`.\n\nIn summary, you should use `==` for comparing lists or other mutable objects if you want to check for equality in terms of value. The warning in PyCharm can be ignored when using `==`, as it is the correct approach for comparing the contents of lists. If you're using `is`, it should be for identity checks, such as checking if a variable is `None`."
