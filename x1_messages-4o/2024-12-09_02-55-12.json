        "content": "I'm working on a script which sometimes encounters a memory leak due to unused tensors in Tensorflow.js. This generally happens when I'm training a neural network and it crashes, resulting in tensors not being properly disposed of. I've tried using `tf.tidy` to dispose of unused tensors, but it only works for synchronous function calls and can't be used when calling `await model.fitDataset(...)`. Is there any method to dispose of any unused tensors or alternatively, is there a way to dispose of all existing tensors on the page without reloading it? Here's the code snippet for reference:\n\n```javascript\nasync function train(shouldCrash) {\n  console.log(`Training, shouldCrash=${shouldCrash}`);\n  const dataset = tf.data.zip({ // setup data\n    xs: tf.data.array([[1],[1]]),\n    ys: tf.data.array([1]),\n  }).batch(1);\n\n  const model = tf.sequential({ // setup model\n    layers: [\n      tf.layers.dense({units: 1, inputShape: [1]}),\n      tf.layers.reshape({targetShape: [(shouldCrash ? 2 : 1)]}), // use invalid shape when crashing\n    ],\n  });\n  model.compile({ optimizer: 'sgd', loss: 'meanSquaredError' });\n  console.log('  Tensors before:', tf.memory().numTensors);\n  try {\n    const history = await model.fitDataset(dataset, { epochs: 1 });\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.log(`    Error: ${err.message}`);\n  }\n  console.log('  Tensors after:', tf.memory().numTensors);\n}\n\n(async () =>{\n  await train(false); // normal training\n  await train(true); // training with error\n})();\n```"

        "content": "Handling memory leaks in TensorFlow.js can be tricky, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations like `model.fitDataset()`. Here are a few strategies you can use to manage and dispose of unused tensors effectively:\n\n1. **Manual Disposal of Tensors:**\n   While `tf.tidy` is useful for managing tensors in a synchronous block, you can manually dispose of any tensors that are no longer needed. This includes any intermediate tensors created during model operations or datasets. Use the `dispose` method on tensors or models when you are done with them.\n\n   ```javascript\n   dataset.xs.dispose();\n   dataset.ys.dispose();\n   model.dispose();\n   ```\n\n2. **Tracking Tensors:**\n   You can keep track of tensors you create and manually dispose of them when they are no longer needed. This is especially useful if you create tensors outside the scope of `tf.tidy`.\n\n3. **Monitoring Memory Usage:**\n   Use `tf.memory()` to monitor the number of tensors and memory usage. This can help you identify memory leaks and ensure that tensor disposal is working as expected.\n\n4. **Using `tf.engine().disposeVariables()`:**\n   If you need to dispose of all tensors and variables, you can use `tf.engine().disposeVariables()`. This will clear all stored variables, but be cautious as this will affect other models and tensors being used globally.\n\n5. **Refactoring Code to Use `tf.tidy`:**\n   If possible, refactor your code to use `tf.tidy` even in asynchronous contexts by encapsulating synchronous operations within `tf.tidy` calls. For example, you can use `tf.tidy` for data preprocessing or model prediction steps.\n\n6. **Error Handling:**\n   In your `catch` block, ensure you dispose of any resources that may have been partially allocated before the error occurred.\n\nHere is how you might adjust your code to manually dispose of resources:\n\n```javascript\nasync function train(shouldCrash) {\n  console.log(`Training, shouldCrash=${shouldCrash}`);\n  const dataset = tf.data.zip({\n    xs: tf.data.array([[1],[1]]),\n    ys: tf.data.array([1]),\n  }).batch(1);\n\n  const model = tf.sequential({\n    layers: [\n      tf.layers.dense({units: 1, inputShape: [1]}),\n      tf.layers.reshape({targetShape: [(shouldCrash ? 2 : 1)]}),\n    ],\n  });\n  model.compile({ optimizer: 'sgd', loss: 'meanSquaredError' });\n\n  console.log('  Tensors before:', tf.memory().numTensors);\n  try {\n    const history = await model.fitDataset(dataset, { epochs: 1 });\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.log(`    Error: ${err.message}`);\n  } finally {\n    // Dispose of tensors and model\n    dataset.xs.dispose();\n    dataset.ys.dispose();\n    model.dispose();\n  }\n  console.log('  Tensors after:', tf.memory().numTensors);\n}\n\n(async () =>{\n  await train(false); // normal training\n  await train(true); // training with error\n})();\n```\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you should be able to manage memory usage more effectively and prevent crashes due to memory leaks."
