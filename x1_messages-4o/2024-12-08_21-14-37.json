For example, if I give you the adjectives \"modern\" and \"light,\" the compound adjective would be \"modern-light.\" Can you write a Scala function to automate this process? \nHere's a sample Scala code that can achieve this:\ndef generateCompoundAdjective(adj1: String, adj2: String): String = {\n  val hyphenatedAdjs = adj1 + \"-\" + adj2\n  hyphenatedAdjs\n}\nThis function takes in two adjectives as input and returns a string with the hyphenated adjectives. You can use this function in your code to generate compound adjectives on the fly."

        "content": "Certainly! The Scala function you've provided is a simple and effective way to generate a compound adjective by combining two given adjectives with a hyphen. Here's a refined version of your function, including additional features such as input validation to ensure the inputs are non-empty strings:\n\n```scala\ndef generateCompoundAdjective(adj1: String, adj2: String): String = {\n  // Ensure both adjectives are non-empty\n  if (adj1.trim.isEmpty || adj2.trim.isEmpty) {\n    throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Both adjectives must be non-empty strings.\")\n  }\n\n  // Combine adjectives with a hyphen\n  s\"${adj1.trim}-${adj2.trim}\"\n}\n\n// Example usage:\nval compoundAdjective = generateCompoundAdjective(\"modern\", \"light\")\nprintln(compoundAdjective) // Output: modern-light\n```\n\n### Features:\n- **Input Validation**: The function checks if both input adjectives are non-empty. If either is empty, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`.\n- **Trimming**: It trims any leading or trailing whitespace from the input adjectives to ensure clean output.\n\n### Usage:\nYou can use this function in your Scala application to dynamically create compound adjectives. Just call `generateCompoundAdjective` with two adjective strings, and it will return the hyphenated result.\n\nFeel free to modify the function further if you have additional requirements or need to handle more complex scenarios!"
