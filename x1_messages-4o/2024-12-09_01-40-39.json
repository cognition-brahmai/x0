        "content": "When it comes to generating multi-page PDFs with grids in Python, there are several libraries that can help you, each with its own strengths. Here are a few that you might find useful:\n\n1. **ReportLab**: This is one of the most popular libraries for creating PDFs in Python. It offers a lot of flexibility and allows you to create complex layouts. With ReportLab, you can easily handle multi-page documents, and while it doesn\u2019t automatically manage page overflow, you can implement logic to detect when a page is full and start a new page.\n\n2. **FPDF (FPDF2 for Python 3)**: This is a simple and easy-to-use library for PDF generation. It allows you to create multi-page PDFs, and you can manage page breaks manually. It's particularly good for handling tables and grids with its cell and multi-cell functions.\n\n3. **Pandas and Matplotlib with PdfPages**: If your grids are based on dataframes, you can use Pandas along with Matplotlib\u2019s `PdfPages` to create multi-page PDFs. While this doesn\u2019t automatically detect page overflow, you can programmatically manage the layout of your plots and tables across multiple pages.\n\n4. **PyPDF2**: Although primarily used for manipulating existing PDFs, it can be combined with other libraries to manage the creation and modification of PDF documents.\n\n5. **WeasyPrint**: This library converts HTML and CSS to PDF. It's very useful if you're comfortable working with HTML/CSS to layout your grids, as it can automatically handle pagination.\n\n6. **PDFKit**: This is a wrapper for wkhtmltopdf, and it can convert HTML to PDF. Like WeasyPrint, it can handle pagination automatically if you use HTML/CSS for layout.\n\nTo implement automatic page breaks, you would typically need to keep track of content height and manually trigger a new page when the content exceeds the page height, unless using a library like WeasyPrint or PDFKit that handles HTML/CSS layouts."
