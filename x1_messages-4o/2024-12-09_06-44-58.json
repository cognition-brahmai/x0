Here is an example of my current code:\n\n```python\ndef example(arg1, arg2, arg3):\n    if arg1 == 1:\n        if arg2 == 2:\n            if arg3 == 3:\n                print(\"Example Text\")\n```\n\nMy issue is that this code does not print anything if arg2 and arg3 are equal to any value other than 0. How can I modify this code to allow for multiple conditions within one if statement?"

        "content": "To implement multiple conditions within a single `if` statement in Python, you can use logical operators such as `and`, `or`, and `not`. In your case, you want to check that all conditions are true at the same time, so you should use the `and` operator to combine them. Here\u2019s how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\ndef example(arg1, arg2, arg3):\n    if arg1 == 1 and arg2 == 2 and arg3 == 3:\n        print(\"Example Text\")\n```\n\nThis code will print \"Example Text\" only if `arg1` is 1, `arg2` is 2, and `arg3` is 3, all at the same time. If any of these conditions is not met, the print statement will not be executed.\n\nIn your original code, the conditions were nested, meaning that each condition was dependent on the previous one being true. By using the `and` operator, you can check all conditions simultaneously in a single line, which is often more readable and efficient."
