For instance, I can join a list using list comprehension like this:\n\n```python\n''.join([ str(_) for _ in xrange(10) ])\n```\nThis returns '0123456789'. The 'join' method requires an iterable. The argument here is `[ str(_) for _ in xrange(10) ]`, which is a list comprehension.\n\nOn the other hand, I can also perform a similar operation without the square brackets:\n\n```python\n''.join( str(_) for _ in xrange(10) )\n```\nThis also returns '0123456789'. However, the argument here is just `str(_) for _ in xrange(10)`, without `[]`, yet the result is the same. Why does this happen? Does `str(_) for _ in xrange(10)` also produce a list or an iterable?"

        "content": "Great question! The difference between using square brackets and not using them in list comprehensions (or generator expressions) when used with the `join` method is an interesting aspect of Python.\n\n1. **List Comprehension with Square Brackets:**\n   ```python\n   ''.join([str(_) for _ in xrange(10)])\n   ```\n   When you use square brackets, you are creating a list. In this case, `[str(_) for _ in xrange(10)]` creates a list containing the string representations of numbers from 0 to 9. The `join` method then takes this list and concatenates its elements into a single string.\n\n2. **Generator Expression without Square Brackets:**\n   ```python\n   ''.join(str(_) for _ in xrange(10))\n   ```\n   When you omit the square brackets, you are using a generator expression. Unlike list comprehensions, generator expressions do not create a list in memory. Instead, they generate items one by one, which can be more memory efficient, especially when dealing with large datasets. The `join` method can work with any iterable, and a generator expression is indeed an iterable.\n\nBoth approaches yield the same final result in this example, which is the string '0123456789'. However, using a generator expression can be more efficient in terms of memory usage, as it does not require storing all elements in memory at once. The choice between them often depends on the context and specific needs of your application."
