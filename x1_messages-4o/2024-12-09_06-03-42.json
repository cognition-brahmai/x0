        "content": "When you use `urllib.urlopen()` in Python, it returns a file-like object that represents the response from the URL you opened. It is good practice to close this object after you are done with it to free up any resources and avoid leaking connections.\n\nIn Python 2, you would typically do this as follows:\n\n```python\nimport urllib\n\nresponse = urllib.urlopen('http://example.com')\ntry:\n    # Process the response\n    html = response.read()\nfinally:\n    response.close()\n```\n\nIn Python 3, `urllib.urlopen()` has been replaced by `urllib.request.urlopen()`, and the use of context managers (`with` statement) is recommended for automatically handling the opening and closing of resources:\n\n```python\nimport urllib.request\n\nwith urllib.request.urlopen('http://example.com') as response:\n    html = response.read()\n```\n\nUsing a `with` statement ensures that the resource is properly closed after its block is executed, even if an error occurs. Therefore, it's recommended to use the `with` statement to avoid forgetting to close the connection and to handle exceptions gracefully."
