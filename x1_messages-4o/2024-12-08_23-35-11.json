The pawn is worth 1 point, the knight and bishop are worth 3 points, the rook is worth 5 points, and the queen is worth 9 points. Samantha wants to arrange a set of chess pieces on a board such that their total value adds up to exactly 100 points. Can you help her by placing the following pieces on the board?\n1. 4 pawns\n2. 2 knights\n3. 2 bishops\n4. 1 rook\n5. 1 queen\nHint: The chessboard is an 8x8 square board with alternating black and white squares."

        "content": "Let's calculate the total value of the pieces Samantha wants to place on the board:\n\n1. **4 Pawns**: Each pawn is worth 1 point, so 4 pawns are worth \\(4 \\times 1 = 4\\) points.\n2. **2 Knights**: Each knight is worth 3 points, so 2 knights are worth \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) points.\n3. **2 Bishops**: Each bishop is worth 3 points, so 2 bishops are worth \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) points.\n4. **1 Rook**: Each rook is worth 5 points, so 1 rook is worth 5 points.\n5. **1 Queen**: Each queen is worth 9 points, so 1 queen is worth 9 points.\n\nAdding these values together:\n\n\\[ 4 \\, (\\text{pawns}) + 6 \\, (\\text{knights}) + 6 \\, (\\text{bishops}) + 5 \\, (\\text{rook}) + 9 \\, (\\text{queen}) = 30 \\, \\text{points} \\]\n\nCurrently, the total value is 30 points. To reach exactly 100 points, Samantha needs additional pieces. Let's determine the additional pieces required:\n\n\\[ 100 - 30 = 70 \\, \\text{points} \\]\n\nTo achieve a total of 70 additional points, we can add more of the higher-value pieces like queens and rooks, as they add more value quickly. Here's one way to achieve 70 points:\n\n- **7 Queens**: Each queen is worth 9 points, so 7 queens are worth \\(7 \\times 9 = 63\\) points.\n- **1 Rook**: Each rook is worth 5 points, so 1 rook is worth 5 points.\n- **2 Pawns**: Each pawn is worth 1 point, so 2 pawns are worth \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\) points.\n\nAdding these additional pieces:\n\n\\[ 63 \\, (\\text{queens}) + 5 \\, (\\text{rook}) + 2 \\, (\\text{pawns}) = 70 \\, \\text{points} \\]\n\nBy adding these pieces to the initial 30 points, we get exactly 100 points:\n\n\\[ 30 + 70 = 100 \\, \\text{points} \\]\n\nThus, Samantha can place the following pieces on the board to achieve a total value of 100 points:\n\n- Initial pieces: 4 pawns, 2 knights, 2 bishops, 1 rook, 1 queen (30 points)\n- Additional pieces: 7 queens, 1 rook, 2 pawns (70 points)\n\nThis configuration will meet the requirement of exactly 100 points on the chessboard."
