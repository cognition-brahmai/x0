I recently created some templates and now I am unable to run the server.

How can I resolve this issue and where should I import `include` from?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the `include` function is not imported in your `urls.py` file. In Django, the `include` function is used to reference other URLconf modules, and it needs to be imported from `django.urls`.\n\nHere's how you can resolve the issue:\n\n1. Open your `urls.py` file where you have the line `path('apppath/', include('myapp.urls'))`.\n\n2. At the top of this file, you need to import the `include` function. You should also ensure that `path` is imported if it's not already. Your import statements should look like this:\n\n   ```python\n   from django.urls import path, include\n   ```\n\n3. After adding this import statement, the beginning of your `urls.py` file should look something like this:\n\n   ```python\n   from django.contrib import admin\n   from django.urls import path, include\n\n   urlpatterns = [\n       path('admin/', admin.site.urls),\n       path('apppath/', include('myapp.urls')),\n   ]\n   ```\n\n4. Save the file and try running your server again using the command `python manage.py runserver`.\n\nBy ensuring that `include` is properly imported from `django.urls`, your error should be resolved, and the server should run without issues."
