        "content": "To convert a datetime/timestamp from one timezone to another in Python, you can use the `pytz` library, which allows you to handle timezone conversions, taking into account daylight savings and other timezone-related intricacies. Below is an example of how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport datetime\nimport pytz\n\n# Get the current time in the server's local timezone\ncurrent_time = datetime.datetime.now()\n\n# Define the server's timezone and the new timezone\nserver_timezone = pytz.timezone(\"US/Eastern\")\nnew_timezone = pytz.timezone(\"US/Pacific\")\n\n# Localize the current time to the server's timezone\nlocalized_current_time = server_timezone.localize(current_time)\n\n# Convert the localized time to the new timezone\ncurrent_time_in_new_timezone = localized_current_time.astimezone(new_timezone)\n\nprint(\"Current time in server timezone:\", localized_current_time)\nprint(\"Current time in new timezone:\", current_time_in_new_timezone)\n```\n\nHere's what the code does:\n\n1. It uses `datetime.datetime.now()` to get the current time according to the server's system time.\n2. It defines the server's timezone and the target timezone using `pytz.timezone()`.\n3. It localizes the current time to the server's timezone using `localize()`. This step is crucial because it associates the naive datetime object with the specified timezone.\n4. It converts the localized time to the new timezone using `astimezone()`.\n5. Finally, it prints the current time in both the server timezone and the new timezone.\n\nMake sure you have the `pytz` library installed. You can install it using pip if it's not already installed:\n\n```bash\npip install pytz\n```"
