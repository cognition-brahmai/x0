The function is known to grow in terms of RAM usage but then frees it once the execution of the function is complete. I want to track the total amount of RAM used during the function call. The existing solutions I found on Stack Overflow seem to track memory usage at the time the heap() method is called, which is not what I am looking for."

        "content": "To track the maximum amount of RAM allocated during the execution of a function in Python, especially when dealing with functions from external libraries, you can use a combination of memory profiling tools. One effective approach is to use the `tracemalloc` module, which is included in Python's standard library, along with a custom context manager to capture the peak memory usage during the function call. Here is a step-by-step guide on how you can achieve this:\n\n1. **Enable Tracemalloc:**\n   First, you'll need to enable the `tracemalloc` module to start tracking memory allocations.\n\n2. **Create a Context Manager:**\n   Define a context manager that will start and stop the `tracemalloc` module around the function call. This context manager will also capture the peak memory usage.\n\n3. **Measure Peak Memory:**\n   Use the `tracemalloc` module to get the peak memory usage during the function execution.\n\nHere's a sample implementation:\n\n```python\nimport tracemalloc\n\nclass MemoryTracker:\n    def __enter__(self):\n        tracemalloc.start()\n        return self\n\n    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):\n        self.current, self.peak = tracemalloc.get_traced_memory()\n        tracemalloc.stop()\n\ndef track_max_memory_usage(func, *args, **kwargs):\n    with MemoryTracker() as tracker:\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n    print(f\"Current memory usage: {tracker.current / 10**6:.2f} MB\")\n    print(f\"Peak memory usage: {tracker.peak / 10**6:.2f} MB\")\n    return result\n\n# Example usage with an external library function\ndef my_function():\n    # Simulate memory usage\n    a = [i for i in range(1000000)]\n    return sum(a)\n\n# Track the memory usage for my_function\ntrack_max_memory_usage(my_function)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`tracemalloc.start()`:** Begins tracking memory allocations.\n- **`tracemalloc.get_traced_memory()`:** Returns the current and peak memory usage.\n- **`tracemalloc.stop()`:** Stops the tracemalloc module, freeing up resources.\n\n### Notes:\n- The `tracemalloc` module tracks memory allocations in your Python program, but it might not capture memory allocated by external native libraries (e.g., if the function you're calling is a C extension or involves system calls).\n- For more detailed memory tracking, including allocations by external libraries, you might need to use specialized tools like `memory_profiler` or `guppy3`, although these might require modifications to the code or may not provide real-time peak usage.\n- Always ensure to execute this profiling in a controlled environment, as it may introduce overhead that can affect performance or memory usage.\n\nThis approach should give you a good indication of the peak RAM usage during the execution of the function."
