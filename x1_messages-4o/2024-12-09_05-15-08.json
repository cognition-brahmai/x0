I'm trying to set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable so that Python can locate shared object files or static libraries. The quick-fix would be to set the environment variable or invoke the script like `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./script.py`, but this would require setting it again for every new shell opened. I want to set them automatically every time I run the script. I tried using `os.environ['LD_LIBRARY_PATH'] = os.getcwd()`, but it didn't work. In my case, the `.so` files will always be in the same directory as the `.py` file, but they might be moved to another absolute path."

        "content": "To modify the library search path in a platform-independent manner for Python, you can adjust the `sys.path` or use the `ctypes` or `cffi` libraries to specify the path to your shared object files. Unfortunately, modifying the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` directly within a running Python script doesn't affect the current process, which is why your attempt using `os.environ['LD_LIBRARY_PATH']` didn't work. However, there are several portable solutions:\n\n1. **Using `sys.path`:**  \n   If you need to import Python modules from a specific directory, you can append that directory to `sys.path`, but this won't help with `.so` files directly. However, it is useful for Python module path adjustments.\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   import os\n\n   current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))\n   sys.path.append(current_dir)\n   ```\n\n2. **Using `ctypes` to load shared libraries:**\n\n   With `ctypes`, you can specify the path directly when loading the library, which can be determined dynamically.\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   from ctypes import CDLL\n\n   current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))\n   library_path = os.path.join(current_dir, 'yourlibrary.so')\n\n   my_library = CDLL(library_path)\n   ```\n\n3. **Using `cffi` to load shared libraries:**\n\n   Similar to `ctypes`, `cffi` can also be used to load libraries from specific paths.\n\n   ```python\n   from cffi import FFI\n   import os\n\n   ffi = FFI()\n   current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))\n   library_path = os.path.join(current_dir, 'yourlibrary.so')\n\n   my_library = ffi.dlopen(library_path)\n   ```\n\n4. **Setting environment variables in your script's execution environment:**\n\n   If you want to set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for the process that starts your Python script, you can create a shell script to set the environment variable and then execute the Python script.\n\n   ```bash\n   #!/bin/bash\n   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(dirname \"$0\")\n   python3 your_script.py\n   ```\n\n   Save this as a shell script (e.g., `run.sh`) and execute it instead of running the Python script directly.\n\n5. **Using a configuration file or command-line argument:**\n\n   You can have your script read the necessary library paths from a configuration file or command-line arguments, allowing for more flexibility and maintaining platform independence.\n\nBy using one of these methods, you can ensure that your Python script can locate and use the necessary libraries regardless of where they are moved to, without needing to manually set environment variables each time."
