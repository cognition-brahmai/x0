The plots show up just fine when I run the files from the ipython shell or from an ipython notebook. Here's a sample of my python script (trial.py):\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nprint 'please, show my graph'\n\nplt.plot([1,2,3], [1,2,3])\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nWhen I run the above code in the bash terminal, I get the following output, but the plot doesn't show up:\n\n```bash\n[~/Desktop]$ python trial.py\nplease, show my graph\n[~/Desktop]$\n```\n\nIf I import matplotlib and specify the 'TkAgg' backend before importing pyplot, a window opens but closes immediately when I run the script from the terminal. I've tried different ways of importing modules, but none have worked. Here are the ways I've tried:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.pylab as plt\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import pylab as plt\n```\n\nThe plt.show() function is present in my file, and my system details are as follows:\n\n```python\nI'm on a mac OSX 10.11.3.\n\nIn [61]: print matplotlib.__file__\n/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/matplotlib/__init__.pyc\n\nIn [62]: print matplotlib.__version__\n1.4.2\n\nIn [64]: print sys.version\n2.7.9 (default, Apr  7 2015, 07:58:25)\n[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)]\n\nIn [65]: matplotlib.get_backend()\nOut[65]: u'MacOSX'\n```\n\nCan someone help me figure out how to get matplotlib plots to display when running files from a bash terminal?"

        "content": "It sounds like you're running into issues with the backend that matplotlib is using to render plots. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Display Environment**: Make sure that your MacOS is set up to allow GUI applications to open. Sometimes, if you're accessing the system via SSH, GUI applications won't display.\n\n2. **Use a Different Backend**: You can explicitly set the matplotlib backend in your script to ensure compatibility. You mentioned trying 'TkAgg', but there are other backends to consider, such as 'Qt5Agg', 'Qt4Agg', or 'Agg' (for non-GUI backend). Try adding the following lines at the top of your script before importing `pyplot`:\n\n    ```python\n    import matplotlib\n    matplotlib.use('TkAgg')  # or try 'Qt5Agg', 'Qt4Agg', etc.\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    ```\n\n3. **Check for Missing Dependencies**: Ensure that the necessary dependencies for the chosen backend are installed on your system. For 'TkAgg', you need Tkinter, and for 'Qt5Agg', you need PyQt5 or PySide2.\n\n4. **Update matplotlib**: Your version of matplotlib is quite old. Updating it might solve compatibility issues with MacOS:\n\n    ```bash\n    pip install --upgrade matplotlib\n    ```\n\n5. **Run in a Virtual Environment**: Sometimes, conflicting library versions can cause issues. Setting up a virtual environment might help isolate and resolve these conflicts:\n\n    ```bash\n    python -m venv myenv\n    source myenv/bin/activate\n    pip install matplotlib\n    python trial.py\n    ```\n\n6. **Use `plt.pause()`**: If the window opens and closes immediately, adding a pause might help keep the window open:\n\n    ```python\n    plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3])\n    plt.show(block=False)\n    plt.pause(5)  # Keeps the plot open for 5 seconds\n    plt.show()\n    ```\n\n7. **Check for Errors in Console**: Sometimes, errors might be printed in the terminal that are not immediately obvious. Look for any error messages that might indicate what's going wrong.\n\nBy trying these steps, you should be able to figure out the cause of the issue and get your plots to display correctly."
