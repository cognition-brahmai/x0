        "content": "In Tornado, you can obtain the IP address of the client making a request by using the `self.request.remote_ip` attribute within your `RequestHandler` class. This attribute provides the IP address of the client that sent the request.\n\nHere's a simple example of how you can use it in your `RequestHandler`:\n\n```python\nimport tornado.web\n\nclass MyRequestHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):\n    def post(self):\n        client_ip = self.request.remote_ip\n        self.write(f\"The client's IP address is: {client_ip}\")\n```\n\nIn this example, when a POST request is received, the IP address of the client is obtained using `self.request.remote_ip` and then written back in the response.\n\nKeep in mind that if your application is behind a proxy (like a load balancer), you may need to configure Tornado to recognize the `X-Forwarded-For` header, which is commonly used to identify the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through an intermediary. You can do this by setting the `xheaders=True` parameter when creating your Tornado `Application` or `HTTPServer`:\n\n```python\nimport tornado.ioloop\nimport tornado.web\nimport tornado.httpserver\n\nclass MyRequestHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):\n    def post(self):\n        client_ip = self.request.remote_ip\n        self.write(f\"The client's IP address is: {client_ip}\")\n\ndef make_app():\n    return tornado.web.Application([\n        (r\"/\", MyRequestHandler),\n    ])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app = make_app()\n    server = tornado.httpserver.HTTPServer(app, xheaders=True)\n    server.listen(8888)\n    tornado.ioloop.IOLoop.current().start()\n```\n\nWith `xheaders=True`, Tornado will attempt to use `X-Real-Ip` and `X-Forwarded-For` headers to determine the client's IP address. Ensure your proxy is configured to pass these headers correctly."
