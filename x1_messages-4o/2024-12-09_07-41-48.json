        "content": "How can I import a module in Python from a string variable? I am working on a personal documentation project for a nested matplotlib (MPL) library, which differs from MPL's own provided documentation. I am writing a Python script to automate document generation from future MPL releases. I have selected the submodules/packages I'm interested in and want to list their main classes, which I will then process with `pydoc`. However, I am unable to find a way to load a submodule from a string. Here are some examples of what I've tried:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.text as text\nx = dir(text)\n```\n\n```python\ni = __import__('matplotlib.text')\ny = dir(i)\n```\n\n```python\nj = __import__('matplotlib')\nz = dir(j)\n```\n\nWhen I compare the lists generated from the above code using `pprint`, I don't understand what's loaded in the `y` object. It seems to be the base `matplotlib` plus something else, but it lacks the main classes from the `matplotlib.text` package that I need. Can you please guide me on how to correctly load a submodule from a string variable in Python?"

        "content": "To dynamically import a module or submodule in Python using a string variable, you can utilize the `importlib` module, which provides a more flexible mechanism than the built-in `__import__` function. This method will allow you to import a submodule directly and access its contents as you would with a regular static import. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport importlib\n\n# Use the importlib.import_module() function to import a submodule from a string\nmodule_name = 'matplotlib.text'\ntext_module = importlib.import_module(module_name)\n\n# Now you can use dir() to list the attributes of the imported module\nattributes = dir(text_module)\n\n# Print the list of attributes\nfrom pprint import pprint\npprint(attributes)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **importlib.import_module()**: This function allows you to import a module or submodule using its full name as a string. It's more straightforward and reliable for dynamic imports compared to `__import__` which can behave unexpectedly with submodules due to its handling of the module cache.\n- **dir()**: This built-in function lists the names of the attributes of the module, including classes, functions, and variables defined in it.\n\nBy using `importlib.import_module()`, you should be able to import the specific submodule you are interested in and list all its classes and other contents accurately. This method should work seamlessly with the nested structure of the `matplotlib` library or any other Python package you are dealing with."
