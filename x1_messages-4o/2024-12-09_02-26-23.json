        "content": "I am encountering an issue with Django users changing passwords. When a user changes their password, they are logged out, but the password is successfully changed. I am using a standard Django view and the auth framework for this. I would prefer the user to be redirected to their dashboard with a message, but they are being redirected to the login screen. How can I keep the user logged in after changing their password?\n\nHere is my view function:\n\n```python\n@login_required\ndef user_change_password(request):\n    \"\"\"Allows a user to change their password\"\"\"\n\n    if request.method == \"POST\":\n        form = SubscriberPasswordForm(request.POST)\n        if form.is_valid():\n            try:\n                request.user.set_password(form.cleaned_data['password'])\n                request.user.save()\n            except Exception, err:\n                print \"Error changing password: {}\".format(err)\n                messages.add_message(request, messages.ERROR, 'The password could not be changed, please try again '\n                                                              'later. This admins have been notified of this error.')\n            else:\n                #this outputs True\n                print request.user.is_authenticated()\n\n                messages.add_message(request, messages.INFO, 'Your password has been changed successfully')\n                return HttpResponseRedirect(\"/accounts/dashboard/\")\n    else:\n        form = SubscriberPasswordForm()\n\n    return render(request, \"accounts/change-password.html\", {\"form\": form})\n```\n\nAnd this is my password form:\n\n```python\nclass SubscriberPasswordForm(forms.Form):\n    password = forms.CharField(widget=forms.PasswordInput)\n    cpassword = forms.CharField(widget=forms.PasswordInput)\n\n    def clean_cpassword(self):\n        password1 = self.cleaned_data.get(\"password\")\n        password2 = self.cleaned_data.get(\"cpassword\")\n        if password1 and password2 and password1 != password2:\n            raise forms.ValidationError(\n                self.error_messages['password_mismatch'],\n                code='password_mismatch',\n            )\n```"

        "content": "When you change a user's password using `set_password`, Django's default behavior is to log the user out of all sessions because the session authentication hash is invalidated. If you want to keep the user logged in after they change their password, you need to re-authenticate them immediately after updating the password.\n\nHere's how you can modify your `user_change_password` view function to keep the user logged in:\n\n1. After successfully changing the password, use Django's `authenticate` function to re-authenticate the user.\n2. Use `login` to log the user back in with the new credentials.\n\nHere's how you can update your view function:\n\n```python\nfrom django.contrib.auth import authenticate, login\nfrom django.contrib import messages\nfrom django.shortcuts import render, redirect\n\n@login_required\ndef user_change_password(request):\n    \"\"\"Allows a user to change their password\"\"\"\n\n    if request.method == \"POST\":\n        form = SubscriberPasswordForm(request.POST)\n        if form.is_valid():\n            try:\n                # Save the new password\n                request.user.set_password(form.cleaned_data['password'])\n                request.user.save()\n\n                # Re-authenticate and log the user back in\n                username = request.user.username\n                password = form.cleaned_data['password']\n                user = authenticate(username=username, password=password)\n                if user is not None:\n                    login(request, user)\n\n            except Exception as err:\n                print(f\"Error changing password: {err}\")\n                messages.add_message(request, messages.ERROR, 'The password could not be changed, please try again later. The admins have been notified of this error.')\n            else:\n                messages.add_message(request, messages.INFO, 'Your password has been changed successfully')\n                return redirect(\"/accounts/dashboard/\")\n    else:\n        form = SubscriberPasswordForm()\n\n    return render(request, \"accounts/change-password.html\", {\"form\": form})\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n\n- **Authenticate and Login:**\n  - After setting the new password and saving it, retrieve the username and new password from the form data.\n  - Use `authenticate` to verify the credentials.\n  - If `authenticate` returns a valid user object, use `login` to log them in again.\n\n- **Redirect:**\n  - Use `redirect` instead of `HttpResponseRedirect` for cleaner code when redirecting to the dashboard.\n\nThis approach ensures that the user remains logged in even after their password has been changed."
