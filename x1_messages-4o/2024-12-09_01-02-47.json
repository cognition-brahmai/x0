For example, when running the following code:\n\n```python\nsum( ['foo','bar'], '') # TypeError: sum() can't sum strings [use ''.join(seq) instead]\n```\n\nI am aware that the standard method to concatenate strings is to use `\"\".join`. However, my question is why the option of using sum for strings was banned, and no such restriction exists for lists. I am looking for an explanation or a link to a thread explaining this."

        "content": "The design decision to not allow the `sum()` function to concatenate strings in Python is primarily based on performance considerations and the intention to encourage the use of a more efficient method for string concatenation.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation:\n\n1. **Immutable Nature of Strings**: Strings in Python are immutable. This means that every time you concatenate two strings, a new string object is created, and the contents of the original strings are copied over. If `sum()` were used for string concatenation, it would result in poor performance, especially with large numbers of strings due to the repeated creation of intermediate string objects.\n\n2. **Performance Concerns**: Using `sum()` for string concatenation would have a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the total length of all strings. This is because each concatenation operation involves copying all characters of the resultant string so far. On the other hand, `\"\".join()` is optimized to handle string concatenation by creating a single list of all strings and then joining them in one pass, resulting in a time complexity of O(n).\n\n3. **Explicit Guidance**: Python's philosophy emphasizes readability and explicit guidance. By not supporting string concatenation with `sum()`, it nudges developers towards using `\"\".join()`, which is explicitly designed for this purpose and is more efficient. This encourages writing code that is both performant and idiomatic.\n\n4. **Error Message**: The error message you encountered is intentional and serves as a guidance mechanism, pointing developers towards the efficient and recommended method for string concatenation.\n\n5. **Consistency with Data Structures**: While `sum()` works with numbers and lists, its primary use case for lists is to sum numerical values within the list. Strings are a distinct type and have specialized operations and methods like `\"\".join()` that are better suited for their nature.\n\nThese reasons combined led to the decision to restrict the use of `sum()` for strings and instead promote a more efficient and clear method for concatenating them."
