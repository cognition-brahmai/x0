Please provide a Python code example using the given prompt below:\nGiven Prompt: \nIn his hour-long monologue in Doha, FIFA President Gianni Infantino addressed the controversy surrounding the 2022 World Cup. He emphasized the importance of transparency and fairness in the selection process, stating that \"we have nothing to hide.\" Infantino also highlighted the positive impact that the tournament would have on the Middle East region, citing the potential for job creation and economic growth. However, he acknowledged the need for ongoing dialogue and collaboration with all stakeholders to address concerns and ensure a successful event. \n[Python Code]"

        "content": "To extract relevant information from a text document for journalistic writing, you can use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify key points, themes, or sentiments. One common approach involves using libraries such as spaCy, NLTK, or transformers for tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER), keyword extraction, and sentiment analysis.\n\nBelow is a Python code example using spaCy to extract relevant information from the given prompt:\n\n```python\nimport spacy\n\n# Load the English NLP model\nnlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n# Given prompt\ntext = \"\"\"\nIn his hour-long monologue in Doha, FIFA President Gianni Infantino addressed the controversy surrounding the 2022 World Cup. He emphasized the importance of transparency and fairness in the selection process, stating that \"we have nothing to hide.\" Infantino also highlighted the positive impact that the tournament would have on the Middle East region, citing the potential for job creation and economic growth. However, he acknowledged the need for ongoing dialogue and collaboration with all stakeholders to address concerns and ensure a successful event.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Process the text\ndoc = nlp(text)\n\n# Extract named entities\nentities = [(entity.text, entity.label_) for entity in doc.ents]\n\n# Extract sentences containing specific keywords\nkeywords = [\"transparency\", \"economic growth\", \"dialogue\"]\nrelevant_sentences = [sent for sent in doc.sents if any(keyword in sent.text for keyword in keywords)]\n\n# Display results\nprint(\"Named Entities:\")\nfor entity in entities:\n    print(entity)\n\nprint(\"\\nRelevant Sentences:\")\nfor sentence in relevant_sentences:\n    print(sentence)\n```\n\nIn this example, we use spaCy to process the text, extract named entities (like \"FIFA President Gianni Infantino\" and \"Doha\"), and identify sentences that contain specific keywords (\"transparency,\" \"economic growth,\" \"dialogue\"). This helps in identifying critical information that can be useful for journalistic writing.\n\nYou can expand this script by incorporating additional NLP techniques such as sentiment analysis or summarization if needed."
