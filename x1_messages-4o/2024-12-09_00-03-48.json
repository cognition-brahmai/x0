Here's a possible JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Objects\": {\n    \"Categories\": {\n      \"Transportation\": {\n        \"Items\": [\n          {\n            \"name\": \"Car\",\n            \"category\": \"Vehicle\"\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      \"Writing\": {\n        \"Items\": [\n          {\n            \"name\": \"Pen\",\n            \"category\": \"Stationery\"\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      \"Dining\": {\n        \"Items\": [\n          {\n            \"name\": \"Fork\",\n            \"category\": \"Utensil\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this structure:\n\n- The root category is \"Objects.\"\n- Under \"Objects,\" there are subcategories: \"Transportation,\" \"Writing,\" and \"Dining.\"\n- Each subcategory contains items with a \"name\" attribute and a \"category\" attribute indicating their specific type. \n\nThis JSON structure is intuitive and efficiently categorizes the objects based on their primary use."
