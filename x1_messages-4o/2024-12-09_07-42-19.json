I am trying to use PyCharm's test runner which supposedly supports py.test. I am supposed to be able to create a run/debug configuration to run my tests and PyCharm allegedly has a \"create configuration\" dialog box specifically for py.test. However, I am unable to find this dialog box. When I right-click the directory in the Project tool window, I only see a \"Create Run Configuration\" option, which only gives me options for \"Unittests in C:\\mypath...\" and \"Doctests in C:\\mypath...\", but nothing for py.test. Similarly, when I right-click in the editor window, I only see options specific to the unittest framework. I am using PyCharm 1.5.2 on Windows with Python 3.1.3 and pytest 2.0.3. I can successfully run py.test on my tests from the command line, so pytest is installed properly. How do I configure PyCharm to run my py.test tests?"

        "content": "To configure PyCharm to run `py.test` (nowadays known as `pytest`) tests, especially in older versions like PyCharm 1.5.2, you may encounter some limitations, as the support for `pytest` might not be as seamless as in more recent versions. However, you can still set it up by creating a custom run configuration. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Ensure Plugin Installation:**\n   - First, make sure that the `pytest` plugin is installed and enabled in PyCharm. Go to `File > Settings (or Preferences on macOS) > Plugins` and search for `pytest`. If it\u2019s not installed, you might consider upgrading PyCharm to a version that has better support for `pytest`.\n\n2. **Create a Py.test Run Configuration:**\n   - Go to `Run > Edit Configurations`.\n   - Click on the `+` button to add a new configuration and select `Python tests > py.test` (if available). If not, you can create a custom configuration using a regular `Python` configuration.\n   - Name your configuration appropriately, e.g., `PyTest Tests`.\n   - Set the `Script path` or `Target` to point to your `tests` directory or a specific test file.\n   - In the `Parameters` field, enter any `pytest` command-line options you might need.\n   - Set the `Working directory` to the root of your project or where your `pytest.ini` file is located if applicable.\n\n3. **Specify the Test Runner:**\n   - Go to `File > Settings (or Preferences on macOS) > Tools > Python Integrated Tools`.\n   - Set the `Default test runner` to `py.test` if the option is available.\n\n4. **Run the Configuration:**\n   - Select your newly created configuration from the Run/Debug configurations dropdown in the top-right corner of the PyCharm window.\n   - Click the Run button to execute your tests using `pytest`.\n\n5. **Command Line Fallback:**\n   - If the above steps are not working as expected due to the older PyCharm version, you can always execute your tests from the command line using `pytest` directly as a fallback method.\n\n6. **Upgrade Consideration:**\n   - Consider upgrading to a newer version of PyCharm where `pytest` support is more integrated and user-friendly, as this will provide a better experience with rich test discovery and execution features.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to run your `pytest` tests within PyCharm even if the initial setup is not as straightforward due to the version constraints."
