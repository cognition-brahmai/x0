Here\u2019s how you can do it using both methods:\n\n1. **Using `reshape`:**\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Assuming 'row_vector' is your row vector with shape (1, 256)\nrow_vector = np.random.rand(1, 256)\n\n# Reshape the row vector to a column vector\ncolumn_vector = row_vector.reshape(256, 1)\n```\n\n2. **Using `transpose`:**\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Assuming 'row_vector' is your row vector with shape (1, 256)\nrow_vector = np.random.rand(1, 256)\n\n# Transpose the row vector to get a column vector\ncolumn_vector = row_vector.T\n```\n\nBoth methods will give you a column vector with the desired shape of (256, 1)."
