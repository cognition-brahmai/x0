        "content": "The command `python manage.py syncdb` is outdated and was used in older versions of Django. It doesn't handle changes to existing models, like adding a new field. Starting from Django 1.7, you should use Django migrations to apply model changes to the database. Here\u2019s how you can resolve the issue by using migrations:\n\n1. **Create a Migration:**\n   First, you need to create a migration for your changes. Run the following command:\n\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py makemigrations\n   ```\n\n   This will generate a new migration file in your app's `migrations` directory. Django will automatically detect the changes in your models and create a migration script.\n\n2. **Apply the Migration:**\n   After creating the migration, apply it to your database by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py migrate\n   ```\n\n   This command will execute the migration and update the database schema with the new BooleanField.\n\n3. **Check for Errors:**\n   Make sure there are no errors during the migration process. If you encounter any issues, carefully read the error messages and adjust your model or migration scripts accordingly.\n\n4. **Verify the Changes:**\n   Once the migration is successfully applied, check your database (using a database client or Django's admin interface) to ensure that the new field has been added to the table.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully add the new BooleanField to your Django model and have it reflected in your database."
