However, I am having trouble creating a new empty directory that will only exist for the duration of a test session. I discovered that pytest provides support for temporary directories, and I tried to use the `tmpdir` fixture which, according to the PyTest documentation, provides a unique temporary directory for each test invocation, created in the base temporary directory. But when I try to use `tmpdir` in my test file as indicated below:\n\n```python\nimport pytest\n\n# ...\n\ndef test_foo():\n    p = pytest.tmpdir()\n```\n\nI get an `AttributeError` stating that the 'module' object has no attribute 'tmpdir'. Also, trying to import `tmpdir` directly from pytest using `from pytest import tmpdir` results in an `ImportError` saying it cannot import the name tmpdir. How can I successfully use the `tmpdir` fixture to create a temporary directory?"

        "content": "The `tmpdir` fixture in PyTest is designed to be used as a function argument in your test functions rather than being accessed directly from the `pytest` module. This is because `tmpdir` is a fixture, not a method or an attribute you can call directly. Here's how you can properly use the `tmpdir` fixture in your test function:\n\n```python\nimport pytest\n\n# Your test function needs to accept the `tmpdir` argument\ndef test_foo(tmpdir):\n    # Use the `tmpdir` fixture to create a temporary directory\n    temp_file = tmpdir.join(\"tempfile.txt\")\n    temp_file.write(\"content\")\n\n    # You can perform your test assertions or operations here\n    assert temp_file.read() == \"content\"\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's happening:\n\n1. **Fixture Injection:** PyTest automatically provides the `tmpdir` fixture to your test function when specified as a parameter. You don't need to import it explicitly.\n\n2. **Temporary Path:** The `tmpdir` fixture provides a `py.path.local` object which represents a path to a temporary directory that is unique for each test function call.\n\n3. **File Operations:** You can create files and directories under `tmpdir` using methods like `join`, `write`, and others available on the `py.path.local` object.\n\n4. **Cleanup:** PyTest handles the cleanup of these temporary directories after the test session, ensuring that they do not persist beyond the test run.\n\nWith this setup, you can utilize the `tmpdir` fixture effectively to work with temporary directories and files during your tests."
