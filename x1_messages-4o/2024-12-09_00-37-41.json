The code I used is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport sys\nreload(sys)\nsys.setdefaultencoding('utf-8')\n\ndef get_tweets_from_file(file_name):\n    tweets = []\n    with open(file_name, 'rw') as twitter_file:\n        for line in twitter_file:\n            if line != '\\r\\n':\n                line = line.encode('ascii', 'ignore')\n                tweet = json.loads(line)\n                if u'info' not in tweet.keys():\n                    tweets.append(tweet)\n    return tweets\n```\n\nHowever, I am encountering a `UnicodeDecodeError` which says, \n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"twitter_project.py\", line 100, in <module>\n    main()                  \n  File \"twitter_project.py\", line 95, in main\n    tweets = get_tweets_from_dir(src_dir, dest_dir)\n  File \"twitter_project.py\", line 59, in get_tweets_from_dir\n    new_tweets = get_tweets_from_file(file_name)\n  File \"twitter_project.py\", line 71, in get_tweets_from_file\n    line = line.encode('ascii', 'ignore')\nUnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0x80 in position 3131: invalid start byte\n```\n\nDespite going through several similar issues, I am unable to solve this problem. This code worked last time, but now it's not working and I'm not sure why. Can you please help me solve this issue?"

        "content": "The `UnicodeDecodeError` you're encountering is because the `line` you're trying to encode as ASCII might already contain non-UTF-8 encoded bytes, which are causing the decoding to fail. Here's a refined approach to handle the Unicode issue:\n\n1. **Read the file in binary mode**: This ensures that you're reading the raw bytes and can handle encoding explicitly.\n\n2. **Decode with error handling**: Decode the line with UTF-8 (or an appropriate encoding) and specify how to handle errors.\n\nHere's an updated version of your function:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef get_tweets_from_file(file_name):\n    tweets = []\n    with open(file_name, 'rb') as twitter_file:  # open in binary mode\n        for line in twitter_file:\n            try:\n                # Decode the line to a string, ignoring errors\n                line = line.decode('utf-8', 'ignore')\n                if line.strip():  # check for non-empty lines\n                    tweet = json.loads(line)\n                    if u'info' not in tweet.keys():\n                        tweets.append(tweet)\n            except ValueError:\n                # Handle JSON decoding errors\n                print(\"Skipping invalid JSON line\")\n    return tweets\n```\n\n**Key Changes:**\n- Open the file in binary mode (`'rb'`) to read raw bytes.\n- Decode each line explicitly using `decode('utf-8', 'ignore')`, which will ignore decoding errors.\n- Added `strip()` to ensure we're not processing empty lines.\n- Catch `ValueError` to skip lines that fail to parse as valid JSON.\n\nMake sure the encoding you choose (`'utf-8'` here) matches the encoding used in your JSON file. If your data is encoded differently, you should adjust the decoding accordingly."
