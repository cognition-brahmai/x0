It looks like you're working with a PHP script that aims to explore the themes of Dylan Thomas\u2019 poem \"Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night\" and its cultural and historical context. Let's break down the code and discuss the relevant themes and influences:\n\n### Code Explanation:\n\n1. **Themes:**\n   ```php\n   $themes = array(\"hope\", \"despair\", \"love\", \"regret\");\n   ```\n   The poem is often associated with themes such as:\n   - **Hope**: The persistent urging not to give in to death but to fight against it.\n   - **Despair**: The inevitability of death and the emotional struggle it brings.\n   - **Love**: The speaker's love for his father and desire for him to continue fighting.\n   - **Regret**: The reflection on life and the potential regrets of not having lived fully.\n\n2. **Cultural Movements:**\n   ```php\n   $cultural_movements = array(\"romanticism\", \"modernism\", \"postmodernism\");\n   ```\n   While the poem is more closely aligned with Modernism, Romanticism's influence can be seen in its emotional intensity and exploration of personal experience. Postmodernism might not directly influence this poem, but its introspective and questioning nature can be seen as a precursor.\n\n3. **Historical Context:**\n   ```php\n   $writing_period = \"1945-1951\";\n   $events = array(\"WWII\", \"civil rights movement\", \"space race\");\n   ```\n   - **WWII**: The aftermath of the war significantly influenced literature, with themes of existentialism and the questioning of human mortality.\n   - **Civil Rights Movement**: Although more prominent in the U.S., the global fight for rights may have influenced themes of struggle and resistance.\n   - **Space Race**: While more relevant in the later 1950s, the early stages of technological advancement could symbolize the human spirit's reach for the unknown.\n\n### Poem's Message and Context:\n\n\"Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night\" is a villanelle that powerfully conveys a message of resistance against death. Written during a time of global change and reflection post-World War II, the poem captures existential themes prevalent in the mid-20th century. The poem is a plea from the son to his father to resist the inevitability of death with fierce determination. This aligns with the broader cultural movement of existentialism, emphasizing the human condition, individual struggle, and the quest for meaning.\n\nThe poem\u2019s intense emotional appeal and universal themes of life, death, and defiance continue to resonate, transcending its historical moment while reflecting the personal and collective turmoil of its era.\n\nI hope this helps you connect the themes of the poem with its historical and cultural context! If you have any more questions or need further analysis, feel free to ask."
