But how can I do the reverse operation, like finding the 2nd root of 9? Is there a shorthand symbol for this operation, similar to **, or will I need to use the 'math' module?"

        "content": "In Python, you can calculate the nth root of a number using the `**` operator by raising the number to the power of `1/n`. This can be done without using any additional modules. Here's how you can do it:\n\nTo find the nth root of a number `x`, you can use the expression `x**(1/n)`.\n\nFor example, to find the 2nd root (square root) of 9, you can do the following:\n\n```python\nx = 9\nn = 2\nnth_root = x ** (1/n)\nprint(nth_root)  # Output: 3.0\n```\n\nThis approach works for any positive `x` and positive integer `n`. If you want to handle more complex scenarios, such as negative bases or roots, you might need to use the `cmath` module for complex numbers. However, for standard real number operations, the `**` operator works perfectly for calculating roots.\n\nIf you prefer, you can also use the `math` module, which provides a `math.pow` function, although it's not necessary for simple root calculations:\n\n```python\nimport math\nx = 9\nn = 2\nnth_root = math.pow(x, 1/n)\nprint(nth_root)  # Output: 3.0\n```\n\nBoth methods will give you the correct result for calculating roots."
