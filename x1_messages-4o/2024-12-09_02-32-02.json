An example of the messages I am seeing is:\n\n```\n2013-06-08 14:51:48+0000 [scrapy] DEBUG: Telnet console listening on 0.0.0.0:6029\n2013-06-08 14:51:48+0000 [scrapy] DEBUG: Web service listening on 0.0.0.0:6086\n```\n\nThe documentation mentioned setting a LOG_LEVEL. However, I am unsure which file to set this in. My directory structure is as follows:\n\n```\ntutorial/\n    scrapy.cfg\n    tutorial/\n        __init__.py\n        items.py\n        pipelines.py\n        settings.py\n        spiders/\n            __init__.py\n            ...\n```\n\nI also have a 'test.py' file in the 'spider' folder. Can someone guide me on which file and how to set the log_level to remove the DEBUG messages from the console output?"

        "content": "To suppress DEBUG messages in Scrapy, you can adjust the `LOG_LEVEL` setting in your Scrapy project. This setting dictates the minimum level of log messages that will be displayed. By setting it to a level higher than DEBUG, such as INFO, WARNING, ERROR, or CRITICAL, you can prevent DEBUG messages from appearing in your console output.\n\nHere's how you can set the `LOG_LEVEL` in your project:\n\n1. **Locate the settings.py file**: In your project directory structure, you should have a file named `settings.py` located inside the `tutorial` directory (the same directory where `items.py`, `pipelines.py`, etc., are located).\n\n2. **Set the LOG_LEVEL**: Open the `settings.py` file and set the `LOG_LEVEL` to `INFO` or higher. For example, if you want to set it to `INFO`, you can add the following line to the file:\n\n   ```python\n   LOG_LEVEL = 'INFO'\n   ```\n\n   This will suppress all DEBUG messages and only show messages at the INFO level or higher.\n\n3. **Save the changes**: Make sure to save the changes to the `settings.py` file.\n\nHere's a sample snippet you can add to your `settings.py` file:\n\n```python\n# settings.py\n\n# Set logging level to INFO to suppress DEBUG messages\nLOG_LEVEL = 'INFO'\n```\n\nOnce you've made this change, run your Scrapy project again, and you should see that the DEBUG messages are no longer appearing in the console output."
