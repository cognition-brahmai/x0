        "content": "For efficiently estimating the distance between two points given their latitude and longitude, especially for use in an A* graph search where you prefer an underestimation for speed, you can use the **Haversine formula** or the **Euclidean approximation** on a plane.\n\nHowever, since you want an underestimate and are dealing with distances not more than 800 km, a simpler method is the **Pythagorean theorem** applied on a projected plane, which is computationally faster and provides a good approximation for short distances. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Convert the Latitude and Longitude from Degrees to Radians:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{lat1} = \\text{lat1} \\times \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{180}\\right)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{lon1} = \\text{lon1} \\times \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{180}\\right)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{lat2} = \\text{lat2} \\times \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{180}\\right)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{lon2} = \\text{lon2} \\times \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{180}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Differences:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\Delta \\text{lat} = \\text{lat2} - \\text{lat1}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta \\text{lon} = \\text{lon2} - \\text{lon1}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Estimate Distance Using the Pythagorean Theorem:**\n\n   Given that you're working on a relatively small scale (800 km), you can treat the Earth's surface as flat. You may also adjust for the Earth's radius (approximately 6371 km):\n\n   \\[\n   x = \\Delta \\text{lon} \\times \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\text{lat1} + \\text{lat2}}{2}\\right)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y = \\Delta \\text{lat}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{distance} = 6371 \\times \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\n   \\]\n\nThis approach simplifies the calculations and gives you an underestimate of the true distance, which is useful for heuristic purposes in A* graph search. Note that the cosine adjustment for latitude is essential for reducing distortion due to the curvature of the Earth, especially as you move away from the equator."
