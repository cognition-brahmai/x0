This module provides a way to interact with Python's installed packages and their metadata.\n\nHere's a sample script to get a list of installed packages along with their versions:\n\n```python\nimport pkg_resources\n\ndef get_installed_packages():\n    installed_packages = pkg_resources.working_set\n    packages_list = sorted([\"%s==%s\" % (i.key, i.version) for i in installed_packages])\n    return packages_list\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    packages = get_installed_packages()\n    for package in packages:\n        print(package)\n```\n\nThis script will list all installed packages and their versions, similar to what `pip list` provides. The `pkg_resources.working_set` contains all installed distributions, and you can iterate over it to get the package names and versions.\n\nIf you want to access more metadata or need additional functionality, you can explore other modules like `importlib.metadata` (available in Python 3.8 and later) or `pip`'s internal API, though the latter is less stable and not officially documented for public use."
