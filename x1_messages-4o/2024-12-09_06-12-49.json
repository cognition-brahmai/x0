Should I import argparse under the `if __name__ == '__main__'` check and then initialize it? Or should I import argparse with my other modules at the top of the script and configure it in the body of the script? For instance, this is what I've been doing so far:\n\n```python\n#! /usr/bin/env python\n\ndef main(name):\n    print('Hello, %s!' % name)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    import argparse\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description = 'Say hello')\n    parser.add_argument('name', help='your name, enter it')\n    args = parser.parse_args()\n\n    main(args.name)\n```\n\nNone of the style guides I have found mention using argparse in scripts and many examples of argparse scripting do not use the 'if name' check or use it in a different way."

        "content": "In Python, it's generally a good practice to import all modules at the top of your script. This helps with readability and consistency, and it adheres to the conventions laid out in PEP 8, the Python style guide. When using `argparse` in a script that can also be used as a module, you want to structure it in a way that allows the script to be both executed directly and imported without executing the command-line parsing section.\n\nHere's how you can organize your script:\n\n```python\n#! /usr/bin/env python\n\nimport argparse\n\ndef main(name):\n    print('Hello, %s!' % name)\n\ndef parse_arguments():\n    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Say hello')\n    parser.add_argument('name', help='your name, enter it')\n    return parser.parse_args()\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    args = parse_arguments()\n    main(args.name)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Imports at the Top**: All imports, including `argparse`, are placed at the top of the script. This is a common practice that aids in understanding dependencies.\n- **Separate Function for Argument Parsing**: The `parse_arguments()` function is created to handle the command-line argument parsing. This keeps the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block clean and focused on execution control.\n- **`main()` Function**: By having a separate `main()` function, you make it easier to call this function from other modules if your script is imported.\n\nThis structure facilitates the use of the script both as a standalone program and as an importable module, allowing you to call functions without triggering the argument parsing unless the script is executed directly."
