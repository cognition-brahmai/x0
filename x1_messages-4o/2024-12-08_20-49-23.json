        "content": "Certainly! Below is a detailed explanation of how the PHP code works and what each part does. This will help you understand how to fetch job postings from a SQL database and display them in a table format on a webpage.\n\n### PHP Code Explanation:\n\n1. **Database Connection:**\n   ```php\n   $servername = \"localhost\";\n   $username = \"username\";\n   $password = \"password\";\n   $dbname = \"job_database\";\n\n   $conn = mysqli_connect($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);\n   if (!$conn) {\n       die(\"Connection failed: \" . mysqli_connect_error());\n   }\n   ```\n   - This section initializes the connection to the MySQL database using `mysqli_connect()`.\n   - Replace `\"localhost\"`, `\"username\"`, `\"password\"`, and `\"job_database\"` with your actual database credentials.\n\n2. **SQL Query:**\n   ```php\n   $sql = \"SELECT * FROM job_postings WHERE position = 'Data Scientist' AND (description LIKE '%machine learning%' OR description LIKE '%data visualization%')\";\n   ```\n   - This query selects all columns from the `job_postings` table where the position is \"Data Scientist\" and the description contains \"machine learning\" or \"data visualization\".\n\n3. **Executing Query and Displaying Results:**\n   ```php\n   $result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);\n   if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {\n       echo \"<table><tr><th>Title</th><th>Company</th><th>Industry</th><th>Location</th></tr>\";\n       while($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {\n           echo \"<tr><td>\" . $row[\"title\"]. \"</td><td>\" . $row[\"company\"]. \"</td><td>\" . $row[\"industry\"]. \"</td><td>\" . $row[\"location\"]. \"</td></tr>\";\n       }\n       echo \"</table>\";\n   } else {\n       echo \"No results found\";\n   }\n   ```\n   - `mysqli_query($conn, $sql)` executes the SQL query.\n   - `mysqli_num_rows($result)` checks if there are any rows returned by the query.\n   - If results are found, it displays them in an HTML table with headers for \"Title\", \"Company\", \"Industry\", and \"Location\".\n   - `mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)` fetches each row as an associative array.\n\n4. **Closing the Connection:**\n   ```php\n   mysqli_close($conn);\n   ```\n   - This closes the database connection.\n\n### How to Use This Code:\n\n1. **Set Up Your Database:**\n   - Ensure your MySQL database is running, and you have a table named `job_postings` with columns like `title`, `company`, `industry`, `location`, and `description`.\n\n2. **Modify the Connection Details:**\n   - Update the `$servername`, `$username`, `$password`, and `$dbname` with your database credentials.\n\n3. **Embed the Code in a Webpage:**\n   - Save the PHP code in a `.php` file, e.g., `jobs.php`.\n   - Make sure your server supports PHP and has access to the database.\n\n4. **Access the Webpage:**\n   - Open your browser and navigate to the location of your PHP file (e.g., `http://your-server/jobs.php`).\n\nThis solution will display a table of job postings that match your criteria on a webpage. You can further style the table with CSS to improve its appearance."
