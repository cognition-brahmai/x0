As far as I know, it can't actually be tested since instantiation of an abstract class will result in an exception. Is there a workaround to this situation? Or do I have to accept less than 100% test coverage? I have thought of removing the `ABCMeta` usage and having the base class raise `NotImplementedError`, but I prefer the former method."

        "content": "When dealing with abstract base classes in Python, achieving full test coverage can be challenging due to the nature of abstract methods and properties. However, there are strategies you can employ to work around this issue and still maintain high test coverage:\n\n1. **Concrete Subclass for Testing**: Create a concrete subclass of your abstract base class specifically for testing purposes. This subclass should implement the abstract properties and methods. This way, you can instantiate the subclass and test the behavior of the abstract property.\n\n   ```python\n   class ConcreteClass(MyAbstractClass):\n       @property\n       def myproperty(self):\n           return \"test_value\"\n\n   def test_myproperty():\n       obj = ConcreteClass()\n       assert obj.myproperty == \"test_value\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Mocking**: Use mocking to simulate the behavior of the abstract class. This allows you to test the abstract property without creating a concrete subclass. Libraries like `unittest.mock` can be helpful here.\n\n   ```python\n   from unittest.mock import MagicMock\n\n   def test_myproperty_with_mock():\n       abstract_instance = MagicMock(spec=MyAbstractClass)\n       abstract_instance.myproperty = \"mock_value\"\n       assert abstract_instance.myproperty == \"mock_value\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Testing for Abstract Class Behavior**: You can write tests to ensure that trying to instantiate the abstract class raises the appropriate exception, confirming the enforcement of the abstract property.\n\n   ```python\n   import pytest\n\n   def test_cannot_instantiate_abstract_class():\n       with pytest.raises(TypeError):\n           MyAbstractClass()\n   ```\n\nBy employing these strategies, you can achieve higher test coverage while retaining the benefits of using `ABCMeta` and abstract properties. Each approach has its own trade-offs, so consider which one aligns best with your project's testing philosophy and requirements."
