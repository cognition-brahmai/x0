I have a list of states which I am encapsulating using the 'enum' module. However, I am encountering issues when I try to use the values as strings in many contexts in my script. For example, the below code works but it's not neat:\n\n```python\nselect_query1 = select(...).where(Process.status == str(MyEnum.state1))\n```\n\nBut this code throws an exception:\n\n```python\nselect_query2 = select(...).where(Process.status == MyEnum.state1)\n```\n\nHere is the enum code:\n\n```python\nfrom enum import Enum\n\nclass MyEnum(Enum):\n    state1='state1'\n    state2 = 'state2'\n\nstate = MyEnum.state1\nMyEnum['state1'] == state  # here it works\n'state1' == state  # here it does not throw but returns False (fail!)\n```\n\nHow can I solve this issue?"

        "content": "To use the values of an enum as strings in Python without invoking additional type conversion, you can ensure that you are comparing the string representation of the enum member directly. In your case, you want the enum member to behave like a string in comparisons and other operations. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n1. **Access the `.value` attribute**: Enum members have a `.value` attribute that holds the actual value. You can use this attribute for comparisons and assignments.\n\n2. **Custom Method**: Alternatively, you can implement a custom method or property in your enum that returns the string representation directly.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n### Using `.value`\n\n```python\nfrom enum import Enum\nfrom sqlalchemy import select\n\nclass MyEnum(Enum):\n    state1 = 'state1'\n    state2 = 'state2'\n\n# When creating your query, use the `.value` attribute\nselect_query2 = select(...).where(Process.status == MyEnum.state1.value)\n```\n\n### Custom Method Approach\n\nIf you want to encapsulate this behavior, you can define a method within your enum class to return the string value:\n\n```python\nfrom enum import Enum\nfrom sqlalchemy import select\n\nclass MyEnum(Enum):\n    state1 = 'state1'\n    state2 = 'state2'\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return self.value\n\n# Now you can directly use the enum in a string context\nselect_query2 = select(...).where(Process.status == str(MyEnum.state1))\n```\n\nBy using the `.value` attribute or implementing the `__str__` method, you ensure that your enum members can be used as strings seamlessly. This should solve the issues you are encountering with comparisons in your script."
