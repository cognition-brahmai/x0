Currently, I'm listing my dependencies as follows:\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom setuptools import setup, find_packages\nhere = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))\n\nrequires = [\n    'pyramid',\n    'pyramid_debugtoolbar',\n    'waitress',\n    'requests',\n    'mock',\n    'gunicorn',\n    'mongoengine',\n    ]\n\nsetup(name='repoapi',\n      version='0.0',\n      description='repoapi',\n      packages=find_packages(),\n      include_package_data=True,\n      zip_safe=False,\n      install_requires=requires,\n      tests_require=requires,\n      test_suite=\"repoapi\",\n      entry_points=\"\"\"\\\n      [paste.app_factory]\n      main = repoapi:main\n      \"\"\",\n      )\n```\n\nHowever, I'm experiencing some issues. For instance, I'm unable to use the system-wide nosetests plugin to run tests for the 'pyramid' package unless I install it in the global python site-packages. I'd prefer to install 'nose' in the virtual environment for this project, but I don't want it to be a dependency. At the same time, I don't want to manually install it every time. \n\nAdditionally, I'm considering using 'pip install' with requirement files as it seems more accurate and wouldn't require me to manually specify the version or be afraid of updating setup.py manually. However, I'm worried that pip might return garbage because we throw garbage packages into the virtual environment. \n\nHow would you recommend dealing with these issues? Specifically, how can I avoid tampering the global python site-packages, install 'nose' as part of the virtual environment without making it a dependency, and avoid manual updates to setup.py?"

        "content": "To address your concerns and improve the management of dependencies in your Python project, it's important to follow certain best practices. Here are some recommendations:\n\n1. **Use a `requirements.txt` File:**\n   - Use a `requirements.txt` file to pin down the exact versions of packages your application depends on for deployment or continuous integration. This is especially useful for production environments where stability is key.\n   - You can generate it by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in your virtual environment.\n\n2. **Separate Development and Production Dependencies:**\n   - Use `extras_require` in your `setup.py` to specify additional dependencies needed for development, testing, or other purposes. This way, you can separate the core dependencies from the optional ones.\n   - For example, you can add:\n     ```python\n     extras_require={\n         'dev': ['nose'],\n     }\n     ```\n   - Then, you can install the extra dependencies using: `pip install .[dev]`.\n\n3. **Use `setup.cfg` for Configuration:**\n   - Consider using `setup.cfg` to store configuration data. This can help clean up your `setup.py` and separate code from configuration.\n\n4. **Virtual Environments:**\n   - Always use a virtual environment for your projects to avoid polluting the global Python installation. This will also allow you to install packages like `nose` within the project scope without affecting other projects.\n   - Create a virtual environment with `python -m venv venv` and activate it before installing any packages.\n\n5. **Automate Environment Setup:**\n   - Consider using a tool like `pipenv` or `poetry` to manage your dependencies. They provide a lock file that ensures consistent environments across different setups and simplify the process of creating and managing virtual environments.\n   - For example, with `pipenv`, just run `pipenv install --dev` to install both your main and development dependencies.\n\n6. **Version Pinning:**\n   - For your production dependencies, consider pinning specific versions in your `requirements.txt` to avoid unexpected issues when packages update. You can use version specifiers like `pyramid==1.10.4`.\n\n7. **Testing:**\n   - Ensure your `tests_require` in `setup.py` only includes dependencies needed for running tests. However, with modern workflows, it is more common to handle this with a `requirements-dev.txt` or through `extras_require`.\n\n8. **Continuous Integration:**\n   - Set up CI/CD to automatically test your application in a clean environment to catch any issues with dependencies.\n\nBy following these best practices, you can effectively manage dependencies, avoid global installations, and maintain a clean and stable development environment."
