        "content": "Certainly! Here are five types of computer programming languages:\n\n1. **Procedural Programming Languages**: These languages are based on the concept of procedure calls and include languages like C, Fortran, and Pascal.\n\n2. **Object-Oriented Programming Languages**: These languages are designed around the concept of \"objects,\" which can contain data and code. Examples include Java, C++, and Python.\n\n3. **Functional Programming Languages**: These emphasize the application of functions and avoid changing-state and mutable data. Examples include Haskell, Lisp, and Erlang.\n\n4. **Scripting Languages**: These are often used for writing short scripts to automate tasks. Examples include JavaScript, PHP, and Python.\n\n5. **Logic Programming Languages**: These are based on formal logic and are used to express facts and rules about problems within a system of formal logic. Prolog is a well-known example.\n\nEach of these types serves different purposes and is suited to different kinds of tasks in software development."
