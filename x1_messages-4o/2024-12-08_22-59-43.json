        "content": "Certainly! Let's explore the properties of modular arithmetic and derive an equivalent equation to \\(8 + 5 = x\\), where \\(x\\) is a residue class modulo a prime number \\(p\\). We will also prove the uniqueness of the solution for \\(x\\) within this residue class.\n\n### Derivation of an Equivalent Equation\n\nGiven:\n\\[ 8 + 5 = x \\]\n\nThis equation can be rewritten in terms of modular arithmetic as:\n\\[ 8 + 5 \\equiv x \\pmod{p} \\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\(8 + 5\\):\n\\[ 8 + 5 = 13 \\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\\[ 13 \\equiv x \\pmod{p} \\]\n\nTo find an equivalent equation, we need to reduce \\(13\\) modulo \\(p\\). Thus, the equivalent equation is:\n\\[ x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{p} \\]\n\n### Proof of Uniqueness\n\nTo demonstrate the uniqueness of the solution \\(x\\) within the residue class modulo \\(p\\), we'll prove that there is exactly one solution for \\(x\\) such that \\(0 \\leq x < p\\).\n\n1. **Existence**: In modular arithmetic, any integer can be expressed in a residue class modulo \\(p\\). Specifically, any integer \\(a\\) has a unique remainder when divided by \\(p\\), where this remainder lies between \\(0\\) and \\(p-1\\). Therefore, the equation \\(x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{p}\\) has a solution for \\(x\\) in \\(\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, p-1\\}\\).\n\n2. **Uniqueness**: Suppose there are two solutions \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) such that:\n   \\[ x_1 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{p} \\]\n   \\[ x_2 \\equiv 13 \\pmod{p} \\]\n\n   This implies:\n   \\[ x_1 \\equiv x_2 \\pmod{p} \\]\n\n   Therefore, \\(x_1 - x_2\\) is a multiple of \\(p\\), i.e., \\(p \\mid (x_1 - x_2)\\). Since both \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are within the range \\(0 \\leq x < p\\), the only possibility is that:\n   \\[ x_1 = x_2 \\]\n\nThus, there is a unique solution \\(x\\) within the range \\(0 \\leq x < p\\).\n\nIn conclusion, for any prime \\(p\\), the equation \\(8 + 5 = x\\) can be equivalently expressed as \\(x \\equiv 13 \\pmod{p}\\), and the solution for \\(x\\) is unique within the defined residue class."
