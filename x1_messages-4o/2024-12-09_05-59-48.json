The function \"six_or_none\" should return 6 if the input is 6, and None if the input is any other number. For example, when testing the function with 4 as the input, the function is expected to return None. But instead, it's reporting that it got nothing. What is the correct way to test for None in doctests?\n\nHere is the function and the test:\n```\ndef six_or_none(val):\n    \"\"\"\n    >>> six_or_none(6)\n    6\n    >>> six_or_none(4)\n    None\n    \"\"\"\n    if val == 6:\n        return 6\n    return None\n```\n\nAnd here is the failure message:\n```\nFailed example:\n    six_or_none(4)\nExpected:\n    None\nGot nothing\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to how doctests handle `None` return values. In Python, when a function returns `None`, it doesn't produce any output on its own. As such, when you run a doctest expecting `None`, it doesn't match the expected `None` because nothing is actually printed.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to explicitly print the result in the doctest. Here\u2019s how you can modify your function's docstring to correctly handle this situation:\n\n```python\ndef six_or_none(val):\n    \"\"\"\n    >>> print(six_or_none(6))\n    6\n    >>> print(six_or_none(4))\n    None\n    \"\"\"\n    if val == 6:\n        return 6\n    return None\n```\n\nBy using `print`, the function's return value will be explicitly shown during the doctest, allowing the expected `None` to be matched correctly with the actual output. This should resolve the issue you are experiencing with the doctest."
