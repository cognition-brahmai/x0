        "content": "To extract news articles related to the impact of climate change on agriculture from an HTML page using Python, you can use libraries like `requests` for fetching web pages, `BeautifulSoup` from `bs4` for parsing HTML, and `newspaper3k` for extracting content and summarizing articles. Here's an example code that demonstrates this process:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nfrom newspaper import Article\n\ndef fetch_html(url):\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    return response.text\n\ndef extract_article_links(html, keyword):\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')\n    links = []\n    for link in soup.find_all('a', href=True):\n        if keyword.lower() in link.get_text().lower():\n            links.append(link['href'])\n    return links\n\ndef summarize_article(url):\n    article = Article(url)\n    article.download()\n    article.parse()\n    article.nlp()\n    return {\n        'title': article.title,\n        'summary': article.summary,\n        'url': url\n    }\n\ndef main(url, keyword):\n    html = fetch_html(url)\n    article_links = extract_article_links(html, keyword)\n    \n    articles_summary = []\n    for link in article_links:\n        try:\n            summary = summarize_article(link)\n            articles_summary.append(summary)\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"Error processing article {link}: {e}\")\n    \n    return articles_summary\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    url = 'https://www.example-news-website.com'  # Replace with the actual URL of the news page\n    keyword = 'climate change agriculture'\n    \n    articles = main(url, keyword)\n    for article in articles:\n        print(f\"Title: {article['title']}\")\n        print(f\"Summary: {article['summary']}\")\n        print(f\"URL: {article['url']}\\n\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Fetch HTML**: The `fetch_html()` function uses the `requests` library to retrieve the HTML content of the given URL.\n\n2. **Extract Article Links**: The `extract_article_links()` function uses `BeautifulSoup` to parse the HTML and extract links containing the specified keyword in their anchor text.\n\n3. **Summarize Article**: The `summarize_article()` function utilizes the `newspaper3k` library to download, parse, and summarize the content of each article.\n\n4. **Main Function**: The `main()` function orchestrates the process by fetching HTML, extracting article links, and generating summaries. It handles exceptions to ensure robust processing of each article.\n\n### Notes:\n- Replace `'https://www.example-news-website.com'` with the actual URL of the webpage you want to scrape.\n- Ensure all required libraries (`requests`, `bs4`, `newspaper3k`) are installed in your Python environment.\n- Depending on the structure of the webpage you're scraping, you might need to adjust the HTML parsing logic in `extract_article_links()`.\n\nThis code provides a basic framework for scraping and summarizing news articles related to climate change's impact on agriculture."
