        "content": "Yes, there are several frameworks in Python that can help with dependency injection, similar to how Google Guice works for Java. Here are a few popular ones:\n\n1. **Dependency Injector**: This is a popular framework for dependency injection in Python. It provides a solid set of features, including container management, configuration support, and lazy loading.\n\n   Website: [Dependency Injector](https://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/)\n\n2. **injector**: This is a simple and lightweight dependency injection framework for Python. It is designed to be easy to use and integrates well with Python's standard library.\n\n   GitHub: [injector](https://github.com/alecthomas/injector)\n\n3. **Pybald**: Although primarily a web framework, Pybald has built-in support for dependency injection, which allows for clean and modular code organization.\n\n   GitHub: [Pybald](https://github.com/pybald/pybald)\n\n4. **pinject**: A dependency injection library that is inspired by Guice. It is designed to be simple and flexible, making it a good choice if you are familiar with Guice.\n\n   GitHub: [pinject](https://github.com/google/pinject)\n\n5. **Spring Python**: This is an offshoot of the Spring Framework for Java, adapted for Python. It provides a comprehensive suite for building enterprise applications, including support for dependency injection.\n\n   Website: [Spring Python](https://springpython.github.io/spring-python/)\n\nThese frameworks vary in complexity and features, so you may want to try a few to see which one best fits your project's needs."
