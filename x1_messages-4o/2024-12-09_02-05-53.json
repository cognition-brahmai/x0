        "content": "To include the related `Wine` model data in the `BottleSerializer`, you should use a nested serializer instead of `RelatedField`. The `RelatedField` is typically used for simple representations like primary keys or string representations, but not for nested objects.\n\nHere's how you can modify your `BottleSerializer` to include data from the `Wine` model:\n\n1. Create a serializer for the `Wine` model.\n2. Use this serializer in the `BottleSerializer`.\n\nFirst, create a `WineSerializer`:\n\n```python\nfrom rest_framework import serializers\n\nclass WineSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):\n    class Meta:\n        model = Wine\n        fields = ['color', 'country', 'region', 'appellation']\n```\n\nThen, update your `BottleSerializer` to use the `WineSerializer` for the `wine` field:\n\n```python\nclass BottleSerializer(serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer):\n    wine = WineSerializer()\n\n    class Meta:\n        model = Bottle\n        fields = ['url', 'wine', 'user', 'date_rated', 'rating', 'comment', 'get_more']\n```\n\nThis approach will serialize the `wine` field as a nested JSON object, including all the specified fields from the `Wine` model.\n\nAlso, ensure that you add any additional fields required in the `Bottle` model that might be missing in your example, like `date_rated`, `rating`, `comment`, and `get_more`. If these fields do not exist in your `Bottle` model, you will need to define them accordingly or adjust the `fields` list in the serializer."
