Right now, I am using the following code:\n\n```python\nprint '%20s : %20s' % (\"Python\", \"Very Good\")\n```\n\nI have tried to make this dynamic by using string concatenation as follows:\n\n```python\nwidth = 20\nprint ('%' + str(width) + 's : %' + str(width) + 's') % (\"Python\", \"Very Good\")\n```\n\nBut I find this method of using string concatenation to be quite cumbersome. Is there a simpler or more efficient method to achieve this?"

        "content": "Yes, there is a simpler and more efficient way to dynamically adjust string formatting in Python, especially if you are using Python 3. You can use the `str.format()` method or f-strings (formatted string literals) to achieve this in a more readable manner.\n\nHere's how you can do it using the `str.format()` method:\n\n```python\nwidth = 20\nprint('{:>{width}} : {:>{width}}'.format(\"Python\", \"Very Good\", width=width))\n```\n\nAnd here's how you can achieve the same using f-strings if you're using Python 3.6 or later:\n\n```python\nwidth = 20\nprint(f'{\"Python\":>{width}} : {\"Very Good\":>{width}}')\n```\n\nBoth of these approaches allow you to easily adjust the width dynamically without cumbersome string concatenation, and they provide a more readable and maintainable code structure."
