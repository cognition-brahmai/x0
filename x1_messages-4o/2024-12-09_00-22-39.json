I'm encountering an error stating that \"Support for string view arguments to url() is deprecated and will be removed in Django 1.10\". The code I am using is from a tutorial teaching Django with a previous version and it uses a string as the second argument in the urlpattern. How can I pass the view argument not as a string? When I try to remove the quotes or import views or main as shown in the Django documentation, I keep getting errors. \n\nHere's the code and error messages:\n\n```python\nfrom django.conf.urls import url\nfrom django.contrib import admin\n\nurlpatterns = [\n    url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),\n    url(r'^$', 'main.views.home')\n]\n```\nError message: \n```python\nRemovedInDjango110Warning: Support for string view arguments to url() is deprecated \nand will be removed in Django 1.10 (got main.views.home). Pass the callable instead.   \nurl(r'^$', 'main.views.home')\n```\nAttempt to remove quotes:\n```python\nNameError: name 'main' is not defined\n```\nAttempt to import views or main:\n```python\nfrom . import views\n```\nor\n```python\nfrom . import main\n```\nResulting error messages:\n```python\nImportError: cannot import name 'views'\n```\nand\n```python\nImportError: cannot import name 'main'\n```\nAny help in resolving this issue would be appreciated."

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to changes in how views should be specified in Django URLs. In older versions of Django, it was common to use strings to refer to view functions, but this is deprecated in favor of passing the callable (the actual function or method) directly.\n\nTo resolve the issue, you need to import your view functions or the module containing them at the top of your `urls.py` file, and then use those directly in the `urlpatterns`. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Ensure you have the correct imports**: First, you need to import the actual view function or the module where your views are defined.\n\n   If your views are in a file named `views.py` within an app named `main`, you should import them like this:\n\n   ```python\n   from main.views import home\n   ```\n\n   Or import the entire module if you have multiple views to use:\n\n   ```python\n   from main import views\n   ```\n\n2. **Update your `urlpatterns`**: Use the imported view function directly in your `urlpatterns`.\n\n   If you imported the `home` function directly:\n\n   ```python\n   urlpatterns = [\n       url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),\n       url(r'^$', home, name='home'),\n   ]\n   ```\n\n   If you imported the entire module and want to use `home` from it:\n\n   ```python\n   urlpatterns = [\n       url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),\n       url(r'^$', views.home, name='home'),\n   ]\n   ```\n\n3. **Check your project structure**: Ensure that your project structure is correct and that the `views.py` file is in the correct location within your Django app. The app should be included in your `INSTALLED_APPS` in your settings.\n\n4. **Run the migration again**: Once your `urls.py` is updated, try running your server or migration commands again to see if the error is resolved.\n\nIf you follow these steps and still encounter issues, double-check the spelling and paths to ensure everything is correctly referenced."
