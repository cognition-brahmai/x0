Opposite sides are equal in length.\n2. Opposite angles are equal.\n3. Consecutive angles are supplementary (i.e., they add up to \\(180^\\circ\\)).\n\nGiven the parallelogram \\(ABCD\\), we know the following:\n- \\( \\angle A = \\angle C \\)\n- \\( \\angle B = \\angle D \\)\n\n### Proof:\nLet's use the property of consecutive angles being supplementary.\n\n1. In a parallelogram, two consecutive angles are supplementary. Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\angle A + \\angle B = 180^\\circ\n   \\]\n\nThis property directly follows from the fact that a parallelogram can be thought of as a quadrilateral whose opposite sides are parallel. When two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, the interior angles on the same side of the transversal are supplementary.\n\nThus, in parallelogram \\(ABCD\\), the consecutive angles \\(\\angle A\\) and \\(\\angle B\\) are supplementary, confirming that:\n\\[\n\\angle A + \\angle B = 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nThis completes the proof."
