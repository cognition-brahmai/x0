I have an SQL file with the schema that I used to create my test database, and as such, I can't simply use `drop_all` and `create_all`. I am in the process of writing unit tests and I need to clear the database content after each test, but without dropping the schema or the tables. Is it possible to erase all the data but leave the tables intact? The application uses Postgres and I need to use Postgres for the tests as well."

        "content": "Yes, it's definitely possible to clear all the data from a PostgreSQL database without dropping the schema or tables. You can achieve this by using SQLAlchemy in combination with SQL statements that truncate tables. Here\u2019s a step-by-step approach to help you set this up:\n\n1. **Reflect the Database:**\n   Since you are already using reflection for your existing database, you can continue using SQLAlchemy's reflection capabilities to access all the tables.\n\n2. **Truncate Tables:**\n   Use a session to execute a `TRUNCATE` statement on each table. The `TRUNCATE` command is efficient for this purpose because it removes all rows from a table without logging individual row deletions.\n\n3. **Disable and Enable Constraints:**\n   If your tables have foreign key constraints, you might need to disable them temporarily while truncating and then re-enable them afterward. PostgreSQL allows you to truncate multiple tables at once and automatically handles foreign key dependencies, making this simpler.\n\nHere's an example snippet of how you could implement this using SQLAlchemy:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\n\n# Assuming you have already set up your engine\nengine = create_engine('postgresql://user:password@localhost/testdb')\n\n# Reflect the tables\nmetadata = MetaData()\nmetadata.reflect(bind=engine)\n\n# Create a session\nSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\nsession = Session()\n\ndef truncate_tables():\n    connection = engine.connect()\n    trans = connection.begin()\n    try:\n        for table in reversed(metadata.sorted_tables):\n            # Truncate each table\n            connection.execute(f'TRUNCATE TABLE {table.name} RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;')\n        trans.commit()\n    except Exception as e:\n        trans.rollback()\n        raise\n    finally:\n        connection.close()\n\n# Use this function in your teardown process after each test\ndef teardown():\n    truncate_tables()\n    session.commit()\n\n# Your test code here\n\n# After each test\nteardown()\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **`RESTART IDENTITY`**: This option resets any sequences associated with the tables, ensuring that your primary keys start from the initial values.\n  \n- **`CASCADE`**: This option ensures that any dependent tables are also truncated, which is useful if you have foreign key dependencies.\n\n- **Error Handling**: Always ensure that you handle exceptions and roll back transactions if something goes wrong to maintain database integrity.\n\nBy integrating this `truncate_tables` function into your test teardown process, you can ensure a clean slate for each unit test without dropping the schema or tables."
