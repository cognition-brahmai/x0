The code I use is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport ConfigParser\nconfig = ConfigParser.ConfigParser()\nconfig.read('test.ini')\n```\nBut what happens if the 'test.ini' file doesn't exist? Why doesn't this method throw an exception? How can I modify this code to make it throw an exception if the file doesn't exist?"

        "content": "In Python's `ConfigParser` module, the `read()` method does not throw an exception if the file doesn't exist. Instead, it simply ignores the missing file and continues execution. This is done to allow reading from multiple configuration files without immediately failing if one of them is missing.\n\nIf you want to throw an exception when the file does not exist, you can manually check for the file's existence before attempting to read it. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport ConfigParser\n\nconfig = ConfigParser.ConfigParser()\nfile_path = 'test.ini'\n\nif not os.path.isfile(file_path):\n    raise FileNotFoundError(f\"The configuration file '{file_path}' does not exist.\")\n\nconfig.read(file_path)\n```\n\nThis code uses the `os.path.isfile()` method to check if the file exists. If the file is not found, a `FileNotFoundError` is raised with a descriptive message. This way, you ensure that an exception is thrown if the file is missing."
