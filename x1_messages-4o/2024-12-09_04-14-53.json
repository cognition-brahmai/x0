For instance, I am currently using the following two-line code:\n\n```python\nmyString = \"Anonym Anonymous\"\na = myString.split()\nfirstName, lastName = a[0], a[1]\n```\n\nCan this be achieved in a more streamlined manner?"

Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfirstName, lastName = \"Anonym Anonymous\".split()\n```\n\nIn this one-liner, the `split()` method splits the string into a list of words, and the list is unpacked directly into the `firstName` and `lastName` variables. This approach works perfectly when you are certain that the string will always split into exactly two elements."
