        "content": "To categorize the list of animals into those that live on land and those that live in water, we can create a Python script that uses a dictionary to group them accordingly. Here's an example of how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef group_animals_by_habitat(animals):\n    habitats = {\n        'land': [],\n        'water': []\n    }\n\n    # Define which animals are typically found in water habitats\n    water_animals = {'blobfish', 'duck'}\n\n    for animal in animals:\n        if animal in water_animals:\n            habitats['water'].append(animal)\n        else:\n            habitats['land'].append(animal)\n\n    return habitats\n\n# List of animals\nanimals = ['blobfish', 'giraffe', 'duck', 'elephant']\n\n# Grouping animals by their habitat\ngrouped_animals = group_animals_by_habitat(animals)\n\nprint(grouped_animals)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `group_animals_by_habitat` that takes a list of animals and checks whether each animal is typically found in water or on land. It uses a predefined set of water animals to determine the habitat and adds them to the corresponding list in the `habitats` dictionary. The result is a dictionary with animals grouped by habitat."
