The program should include a class called \"Astronaut\" that contains the attributes \"name\", \"age\", \"specialty\", \"personality\", and \"unique ability\". The program should also include a class called \"Crystal\" that contains the attributes \"color\", \"shape\", \"size\", and \"rarity level\". The story should be generated using the following format:\nIn the year [year], a team of skilled astronauts named [Astronaut 1 name], [Astronaut 2 name], [Astronaut 3 name], and [Astronaut 4 name] embarked on a mission to explore a distant planet. They were all in their [age]s, and each had their own specialty, with personalities that complemented one another. [Astronaut 1 name] was an expert in [specialty], and had a unique ability to [unique ability]. [Astronaut 2 name] was a skilled [specialty], and had a unique ability to [unique ability]. [Astronaut 3 name] was a [specialty], and had a unique ability to [unique ability]. [Astronaut 4 name] was a [specialty], and had a unique ability to [unique ability]. As they explored the planet, they stumbled upon a rare crystal that was [color], [shape], [size], and with a rarity level of [rarity level]. The crystal was located in a dangerous area, surrounded by treacherous terrain and hostile alien creatures. The team used their unique set of skills to navigate the dangers and obtain the crystal. However, they soon realized that the crystal had the power to transport them through time and space. They made a decision to bring the crystal back to Earth, but it was not without consequence. The journey back home was fraught with peril, and they found themselves in the midst of a time war, with various factions fighting for control of the crystal. The team had to use all of their skills and ingenuity to ensure that the crystal was not used for evil, and that they could safely return home. In the end, they were successful, and the crystal was used to further scientific understanding and benefit humanity."
