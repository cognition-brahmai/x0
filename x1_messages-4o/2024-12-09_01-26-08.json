I wrote a Python script (log_revision.py) that saves the git commit and a few more parameters in a database and finally sends the .whl file (created by poetry) to the remote server. At the moment, I run the script manually after each time I run the 'poetry build' command. I tried using [tool.poetry.scripts] in pyproject.toml to run the script but it gives me an AttributeError. Similarly, when I tried to use 'poetry publish', I got a RuntimeError. Can someone help me understand how to run this command and fix these issues?"

        "content": "To automate the process of running your script after building your package with Poetry, you can integrate your script into the workflow using Poetry's build-system hooks or by setting up a custom command. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you resolve the issues and set up your environment properly:\n\n### 1. Fixing the `AttributeError` with `[tool.poetry.scripts]`\n\nThe `[tool.poetry.scripts]` section is typically used to define entry points for your package, not necessarily for running a script immediately after building. Here's how you can define an entry point:\n\n```toml\n[tool.poetry.scripts]\nlog_revision = \"your_module:main_function\"\n```\n\n- Replace `your_module` with the module name where your script resides, and `main_function` with the function you want to execute.\n\n### 2. Using Build System Hooks\n\nPoetry does not have built-in post-build hooks, but you can use a workaround by leveraging the `pyproject.toml` to include custom build steps if you use something like `setuptools` alongside Poetry. However, Poetry is primarily designed to manage dependencies and package versions, not to handle build scripts directly.\n\n### 3. Running a Script After Building\n\nTo run a script automatically after building, you can create a shell script or a Python script to handle the entire process. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n#### Option 1: Shell Script\n\nCreate a shell script (e.g., `build_and_deploy.sh`) to automate the process:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Build the package\npoetry build\n\n# Run your script\npython path/to/log_revision.py\n```\n\nMake sure to give execution permissions to your script:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x build_and_deploy.sh\n```\n\nThen, run the script:\n\n```bash\n./build_and_deploy.sh\n```\n\n#### Option 2: Python Script\n\nCreate a Python script (e.g., `build_and_deploy.py`) that uses `subprocess` to run the necessary commands:\n\n```python\nimport subprocess\n\ndef build_and_deploy():\n    # Build the package\n    subprocess.run([\"poetry\", \"build\"], check=True)\n    \n    # Run your script\n    subprocess.run([\"python\", \"path/to/log_revision.py\"], check=True)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    build_and_deploy()\n```\n\nRun the script using:\n\n```bash\npython build_and_deploy.py\n```\n\n### 4. Handling `RuntimeError` with `poetry publish`\n\nThe `RuntimeError` might be due to misconfiguration or missing credentials for your remote server. Ensure that your FTP details and credentials are correctly set up. If `poetry publish` is not needed for your FTP deployment, you can ignore this step and directly upload using your script.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy using a script to automate the building and deploying process, you can streamline your workflow and avoid manually running commands each time. If you frequently update your code, this method ensures consistency and reduces the chance of human error."
