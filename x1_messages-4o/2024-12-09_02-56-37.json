        "content": "In Python, the keywords `True` and `False` are capitalized to align with Python's design philosophy and readability guidelines. Here are a few reasons why this choice was made:\n\n1. **Consistency with Other Constants**: In Python, constants like `None` are also capitalized. This provides a consistent style across the language, making it easier to recognize these special values.\n\n2. **Readability and Clarity**: Capitalizing the first letter of `True` and `False` makes them stand out as distinct from other variables, enhancing code readability. It helps to easily identify them as boolean constants rather than variables or functions.\n\n3. **Avoiding Conflicts with Variable Names**: Using capitalized `True` and `False` reduces the likelihood of naming conflicts with user-defined variables. Lowercase names are more commonly used for variable names, so capitalized constants help to avoid accidental overwrites or confusion.\n\n4. **Historical Reasons**: The choice was also influenced by the conventions in other programming languages at the time Python was developed. For example, languages like Java use capitalized `True` and `False`.\n\nThese design choices contribute to Python's goal of having clear and readable code."
