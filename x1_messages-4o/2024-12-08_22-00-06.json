Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Original sentence\nsentence = \"John ate 7 hotdogs and drank 10 beers\"\n\n# Function to modify numbers based on the criteria\ndef modify_numbers(match):\n    number = int(match.group())\n    if number % 3 == 0 or number % 4 == 0:\n        return str(number + 100)\n    return match.group()\n\n# Use regex to find all numbers in the sentence\nmodified_sentence = re.sub(r'\\b\\d+\\b', modify_numbers, sentence)\n\nprint(modified_sentence)\n```\n\nThis script uses a regular expression to find all numbers in the sentence. The `modify_numbers` function checks if a number is divisible by 3 or 4, and if so, adds 100 to it. The `re.sub` function then replaces each number with its modified version if applicable. When you run this code, it should output:\n\n```\nJohn ate 7 hotdogs and drank 110 beers\n```\n\nIn this case, 10 is divisible by both 3 and 4, so 100 is added to it, resulting in 110."
