When I input the following obviously invalid syntax:\n\n```python\nfoo = {}\nfoo['bar': 'baz']\n```\nI understand that the developer intended to move a line out of the dictionary definition but didn't change it from the literal dictionary declaration to the assignment syntax. However, I'm curious as to why Python raises a `TypeError: unhashable type` here rather than a `SyntaxError`. What type is Python attempting to hash here? When I try:\n```python\n'bar': 'baz'\n```\nIt gives a SyntaxError, and so does this:\n```python\n['bar': 'baz']\n```\nSo I'm unable to understand what type is being created that is unhashable. Could anyone clarify this for me?"

        "content": "When you encounter a situation where Python raises a `TypeError` rather than a `SyntaxError`, it's important to understand the context in which the code is being executed and how Python interprets it.\n\nIn your case, when you write:\n```python\nfoo = {}\nfoo['bar': 'baz']\n```\nPython interprets `foo['bar': 'baz']` as an attempt to access an item in the dictionary `foo` using a key. However, the syntax `['bar': 'baz']` inside the brackets is not valid syntax for specifying a single key. Instead, Python treats this as an attempt to use a slice because the colon `:` is typically used for slicing. In slicing, the syntax is `start:stop:step`, but in this context, it's invalid because you are using it with a dictionary.\n\nThe error `TypeError: unhashable type` is raised because Python is attempting to treat the key specification as a tuple that could represent the start, stop, and step for slicing, which is not hashable when it includes mutable types like lists or dictionaries.\n\nTo clarify:\n\n1. `foo['bar': 'baz']` is interpreted as an attempt to use slicing syntax, but you are applying it to a dictionary, which doesn't support slicing in the manner that lists do.\n\n2. Python tries to use the tuple `('bar', 'baz')` as the key, but since tuples with mutable elements are not hashable, it raises a `TypeError`.\n\n3. When you try just `'bar': 'baz'` or `['bar': 'baz']` outside of this context, Python gives a `SyntaxError` because they are not valid expressions on their own and don't conform to any expected syntax patterns.\n\nEssentially, the confusion arises from how Python interprets the `:` in different contexts. When used correctly, `:` can indicate slicing in lists or ranges, but when misapplied, it results in type-related errors when Python attempts to do something meaningful with the expression."
