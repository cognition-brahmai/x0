I have two columns 'A' and 'B' and I want to filter out any row whose column 'A's or 'B's string length is not equal to 10. I have tried using the following code:\n\n```python\ndf = pd.read_csv('filex.csv')\ndf.A = df.A.apply(lambda x: x if len(x)== 10 else np.nan)\ndf.B = df.B.apply(lambda x: x if len(x)== 10 else np.nan)\ndf = df.dropna(subset=['A','B'], how='any')\n```\nAlthough it works, it's slow and sometimes produces an error when the data in column 'A' is not a string but a number (interpreted as a number when `read_csv` reads the input file). The error message is:\n\n```python\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <lambda>\nTypeError: object of type 'float' has no len()\n```\nIs there a more efficient and elegant solution to this problem?"

        "content": "To efficiently filter out rows where the string length of columns 'A' or 'B' is not equal to 10, and handle cases where the data might not be a string (e.g., numbers), you can modify your approach to ensure type safety by converting the values to strings before checking their lengths. Additionally, you can use vectorized operations with `str.len()` for better performance. Here's an improved solution:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the data\ndf = pd.read_csv('filex.csv')\n\n# Ensure the columns are treated as strings and compute the length\ndf['A_len'] = df['A'].astype(str).str.len()\ndf['B_len'] = df['B'].astype(str).str.len()\n\n# Filter the DataFrame based on the length of the strings\ndf_filtered = df[(df['A_len'] == 10) & (df['B_len'] == 10)]\n\n# Drop the temporary length columns\ndf_filtered = df_filtered.drop(columns=['A_len', 'B_len'])\n\n# Now df_filtered contains only the rows with string lengths of 10 in both columns 'A' and 'B'\n```\n\nThis solution ensures that all entries are treated as strings by converting them using `astype(str)`. It then uses the `str.len()` function to compute the lengths efficiently and filters the DataFrame based on these lengths. Finally, it removes the temporary length columns to clean up the DataFrame. This approach should be faster and more robust, especially with mixed data types in the columns."
