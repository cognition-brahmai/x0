        "content": "I am currently using CUDA 6.5 and 4 x GPUs Kepler in a multithreading environment with the CUDA runtime API. I access the CUDA contexts from different CPU threads using OpenMP. I have two questions regarding the `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` function. First, does `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` wait for the kernel(s) to finish only in the current CUDA context selected by the latest call `cudaSetDevice()`, or does it wait in all CUDA contexts? Second, if it waits for the kernel(s) to finish in all CUDA contexts, does it wait in all CUDA contexts used in the current CPU thread (for example, CPU thread_0 will wait for GPUs: 0 and 1) or all CUDA contexts generally (CPU thread_0 will wait for GPUs: 0, 1, 2, and 3)? Here is the code I am working with:\n\n```C++\n// For using OpenMP requires to set:\n// MSVS option: -Xcompiler \"/openmp\"\n// GCC option: \u2013Xcompiler \u2013fopenmp\n#include &lt;omp.h&gt;\n\nint main() {\n\n    // execute two threads with different: omp_get_thread_num() = 0 and 1\n    #pragma omp parallel num_threads(2)\n    {\n        int omp_threadId = omp_get_thread_num();\n\n        // CPU thread 0\n        if(omp_threadId == 0) {\n\n            cudaSetDevice(0);\n            kernel_0<<<...>>>(...);\n            cudaSetDevice(1);\n            kernel_1<<<...>>>(...);\n\n            cudaDeviceSynchronize(); // what kernel<>() will wait?\n\n        // CPU thread 1\n        } else if(omp_threadId == 1) {\n\n            cudaSetDevice(2);\n            kernel_2<<<...>>>(...);\n            cudaSetDevice(3);\n            kernel_3<<<...>>>(...);\n\n            cudaDeviceSynchronize(); // what kernel<>() will wait?\n\n        }\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```"

        "content": "In CUDA, the `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` function is used to block the calling CPU thread until all previous commands in all streams on the current device have completed. Here\u2019s how it works in your case:\n\n1. **Current CUDA Context**: `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` only affects the CUDA context associated with the device that was last set in the calling CPU thread using `cudaSetDevice()`. It does not affect other CUDA contexts or devices that might be active in other CPU threads. Therefore, `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` will only wait for the kernels launched on the currently selected GPU in the calling thread.\n\n2. **Per Thread Execution**:\n   - For **CPU thread 0**: \n     - `cudaSetDevice(0)` followed by launching `kernel_0`.\n     - `cudaSetDevice(1)` followed by launching `kernel_1`.\n     - When `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` is called, it will wait for kernel executions on **device 1** (i.e., `kernel_1`) to complete, because `cudaSetDevice(1)` was the last call before synchronization in this thread.\n\n   - For **CPU thread 1**: \n     - `cudaSetDevice(2)` followed by launching `kernel_2`.\n     - `cudaSetDevice(3)` followed by launching `kernel_3`.\n     - When `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` is called, it will wait for kernel executions on **device 3** (i.e., `kernel_3`) to complete, because `cudaSetDevice(3)` was the last call before synchronization in this thread.\n\nIn summary, `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` synchronizes only the kernels on the device most recently set by `cudaSetDevice()` in the current CPU thread. It does not wait for kernels on other devices or in other CPU threads."
