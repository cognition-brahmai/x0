Here's a simple function that does exactly what you're looking for:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef get_day_of_month():\n    # Get the current date\n    current_date = datetime.now()\n    # Extract the day of the month\n    day_of_month = current_date.day\n    return day_of_month\n\n# Example usage\nday = get_day_of_month()\nprint(day)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- We import the `datetime` class from the `datetime` module.\n- We use `datetime.now()` to get the current date and time.\n- We access the `day` attribute of the `datetime` object to get the current day of the month as an integer.\n- The function `get_day_of_month()` returns this integer, which can then be printed or used elsewhere in your code."
