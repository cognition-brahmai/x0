        "content": "To restrict access to URLs handled by Django Generic Views, you can use the `login_required` decorator along with class-based views in Django. While the `login_required` decorator is typically used with function-based views, you can apply it to class-based views by using the `method_decorator` from `django.utils.decorators`.\n\nHere's how you can apply the `login_required` decorator to a class-based generic view:\n\n1. **Import the necessary modules:**\n\n   ```python\n   from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required\n   from django.utils.decorators import method_decorator\n   from django.views.generic import ListView  # or any other generic view you are using\n   ```\n\n2. **Apply the `method_decorator` to your class-based view:**\n\n   You can apply the `login_required` decorator to specific HTTP methods, such as `get` or `post`, or you can apply it to the whole class.\n\n   ```python\n   @method_decorator(login_required, name='dispatch')\n   class MyListView(ListView):\n       model = MyModel\n       template_name = 'my_template.html'\n   ```\n\n   By using `@method_decorator(login_required, name='dispatch')`, you ensure that the user must be logged in to access any method in the view.\n\n3. **Restricting access to specific methods:**\n\n   If you want to restrict access to only certain methods, you can apply `method_decorator` to specific methods within the class:\n\n   ```python\n   class MyListView(ListView):\n       model = MyModel\n       template_name = 'my_template.html'\n\n       @method_decorator(login_required)\n       def dispatch(self, *args, **kwargs):\n           return super().dispatch(*args, **kwargs)\n   ```\n\n4. **Restricting access with multiple decorators:**\n\n   If you need to use multiple decorators, you can stack them using `method_decorator`:\n\n   ```python\n   from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required, permission_required\n\n   @method_decorator(login_required, name='dispatch')\n   @method_decorator(permission_required('app_name.permission_name'), name='dispatch')\n   class MyListView(ListView):\n       model = MyModel\n       template_name = 'my_template.html'\n   ```\n\nBy using the `method_decorator`, you can effectively apply the `login_required` decorator to any class-based generic view in Django, ensuring that only authenticated users can access the view."
