        "content": "To add a `.H` conjugate transpose operator and a `.I` inverse operator for NumPy ndarrays, you can create a subclass of `numpy.ndarray` and define these properties. This will allow you to use these operators as attributes for your ndarray objects. To make this feature available every time NumPy is imported, you can create a custom module that you import instead of the regular NumPy.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:\n\n1. **Subclass numpy.ndarray**: Create a custom class that extends `numpy.ndarray`.\n\n2. **Add .H and .I properties**: Define the `.H` and `.I` properties in your subclass.\n\n3. **Provide a factory function**: Create a factory function to easily instantiate objects of your custom ndarray class.\n\n4. **Make it readily available**: Save this code in a module that you can import whenever you need this functionality.\n\nHere is a sample implementation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nclass MyArray(np.ndarray):\n    @property\n    def H(self):\n        \"\"\"Conjugate transpose of the array.\"\"\"\n        return self.conj().T\n\n    @property\n    def I(self):\n        \"\"\"Inverse of the array.\"\"\"\n        if self.shape[0] != self.shape[1]:\n            raise ValueError(\"Only square matrices can be inverted.\")\n        return np.linalg.inv(self)\n\ndef my_array(input_array):\n    \"\"\"Factory function to create MyArray instances.\"\"\"\n    return np.asarray(input_array).view(MyArray)\n\n# Example usage:\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Create a complex matrix\n    a = my_array([[1+2j, 2+3j], [3+4j, 4+5j]])\n    print(\"Matrix a:\")\n    print(a)\n\n    # Use the .H operator\n    print(\"\\nConjugate Transpose of a (a.H):\")\n    print(a.H)\n\n    # Use the .I operator\n    print(\"\\nInverse of a (a.I):\")\n    try:\n        print(a.I)\n    except np.linalg.LinAlgError as e:\n        print(e)\n```\n\nTo ensure that this is available every time you import NumPy, you can save the above code in a Python file, say `numpy_extensions.py`, and then import it in your scripts:\n\n```python\nfrom numpy_extensions import my_array\n```\n\nThis way, you can easily have access to the `.H` and `.I` operators for your arrays whenever needed."
