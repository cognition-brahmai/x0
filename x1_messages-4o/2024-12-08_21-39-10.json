To retrieve the population of the United States for the most recent year from a table named \"population\" with columns \"state\", \"population\", and \"year\", you can use an SQL query that aggregates the population by year, filters for the most recent year, and sums the population for all states. Here is an example query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT SUM(population) AS total_population\nFROM population\nWHERE year = (\n    SELECT MAX(year) FROM population\n)\nAND state = 'United States';\n```\n\nPlease ensure that your dataset contains an entry where the \"state\" is 'United States' or adjust the query to sum over all states if the dataset contains individual state populations. If the table contains individual state populations and not a combined entry for the entire country, the query would need to be adjusted to sum the populations of all the individual states:\n\n```sql\nSELECT SUM(population) AS total_population\nFROM population\nWHERE year = (\n    SELECT MAX(year) FROM population\n);\n```\n\nThis query assumes that each state's population is recorded separately, and it sums up the populations of all states for the most recent year. Adjust the query as per your dataset's structure."
