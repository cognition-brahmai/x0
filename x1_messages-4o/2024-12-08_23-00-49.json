The anagrams should also be sorted in descending order based on their frequency counts. Additionally, the prompt should be written in Python code and should include the use of the itertools module to generate all possible combinations of the given set of words. The final output should be presented in a LaTeX table format with columns for the anagram, its frequency count, and its corresponding words. Finally, the prompt should also require the use of SQL to query a database containing a list of common English words to ensure that the generated anagrams are valid words."
