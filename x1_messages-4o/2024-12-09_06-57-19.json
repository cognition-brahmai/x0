However, I've noticed that in many Python programs, the main function is located at the bottom with other function definitions stacked on top of it. This seems counter-intuitive to me. For example:\n\n```\ndef func2(): \n    pass\n\ndef func1():\n    func2()\n\ndef func():\n    func1()\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    func()\n```\n\nWhy is the main function or the function definitions not written from top to bottom? Also, why can't I rearrange the code in the following way?\n\n```\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    func()\n\ndef func1():\n    func2()\n```\n\nIsn't this the natural order of execution since Python is executed from top to bottom?"

        "content": "Your observation about Python being executed from top to bottom is correct, but the way functions and the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block are ordered in a script is more about convention and organization rather than execution order. Let's break this down:\n\n1. **Function Definitions and Execution Order**:\n   - Python reads and processes the code from top to bottom. When it encounters a function definition using `def`, it stores the function in memory but does not execute the function until it is called.\n   - This means that the order of function definitions doesn't impact their ability to be called as long as the function is defined before it is called during execution.\n\n2. **Convention**:\n   - The convention of placing the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block at the bottom of the script is to clearly separate the definition of functions (or classes) from the execution of the code. This makes the script easier to read and understand, especially in larger programs.\n   - The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block is used to ensure that certain code is only executed when the script is run directly, not when it is imported as a module in another script.\n\n3. **Why Your Rearrangement Doesn\u2019t Work**:\n   - In your rearranged code, you are attempting to call `func()` before Python knows what `func` is because the function definition appears after its invocation. Since Python executes from top to bottom, `func()` must be defined before it is called, otherwise, you will encounter a `NameError`.\n\nHere is how you can think about it:\n\n- Definitions (functions, classes) are like setting up tools and materials for a task. They need to be set up before they can be used.\n- The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block is like the \"start\" button for your program, indicating the main flow of execution.\n\nBy sticking to this convention, scripts become more modular and maintainable, allowing functions to be reused easily in different contexts or scripts."
