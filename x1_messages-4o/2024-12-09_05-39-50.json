However, when I use a calculator, the hex value of -199703103 is 'FFFFFFFFF418C5C1'. Are the positive and negative values the same in hex?"

        "content": "In Python, when you convert a negative integer to a hexadecimal string using the `hex()` function, it produces the hexadecimal representation of the corresponding positive integer with a negative sign, which may not be what you're expecting when dealing with negative numbers.\n\nTo get the two's complement hexadecimal representation of a negative integer, you need to consider the bit-length you are working with (for example, 32-bit or 64-bit). Python does not limit integers to a specific bit-length by default, so you have to manually handle this.\n\nHere's how you can convert a negative integer to a 32-bit two's complement hexadecimal representation:\n\n```python\ndef to_twos_complement_hex(value, bits=32):\n    if value < 0:\n        value = (1 << bits) + value\n    hex_value = hex(value)\n    return hex_value\n\nnegative_value = -199703103\nhex_representation = to_twos_complement_hex(negative_value, 32)\n\nprint(hex_representation)  # Output should be '0xf418c5c1'\n```\n\nIn this code, the `to_twos_complement_hex` function first checks if the value is negative. If it is, it calculates the two's complement by adding `1 << bits` (which is equivalent to `2**bits`) to the negative value. This effectively wraps the value within the range of a signed integer with the specified bit length, producing the expected two's complement representation.\n\nRemember that in hexadecimal representation, we typically don't show leading `F`s for the negative sign in a fixed-width representation (like 32-bit), unless it's necessary to indicate the word size. So, for a 32-bit integer, the value `0xF418C5C1` is indeed the correct two's complement representation of `-199703103`."
