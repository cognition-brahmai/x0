Both are syntactically correct and functionally equivalent when defining a new-style class.\n\nHere's a bit of context:\n\n- In Python 2, there was a distinction between \"old-style\" and \"new-style\" classes. The old-style class was defined without parentheses, like `class A:`, and new-style classes were defined with parentheses, even if they were empty, like `class A():`. New-style classes were introduced to unify the concepts of types and classes, providing a more consistent object model.\n  \n- In Python 3, all classes are new-style classes, regardless of whether you include the parentheses or not. Therefore, `class A:` and `class A():` do the same thing and are just a matter of personal or stylistic preference.\n\nIn summary, in Python 3, using or omitting the parentheses in a class definition when there are no base classes makes no difference."
