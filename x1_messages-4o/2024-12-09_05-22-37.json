Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Your data array and group array\ndata = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])\ngroups = np.array([0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1])\n\n# Use np.bincount to sum the data based on groups\nresult = np.bincount(groups, weights=data)\n\nprint(result)  # Output: [3. 9. 9.]\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of how it works:\n\n- `np.bincount(groups, weights=data)` counts the occurrences of each group index and sums the corresponding elements in the `data` array. The `weights` parameter specifies the values to sum.\n- The result is an array where the index corresponds to the group number, and the value at each index is the sum of the elements in `data` that belong to that group.\n\nThis will give you the summed values for each group in the order of group numbers."
