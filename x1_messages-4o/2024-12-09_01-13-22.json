I have set the field to `required=False` in the serializer, but it doesn't seem to work. I am still getting an error when saving the record. Here is my serializer code:\n\n```python\nclass FavoriteListSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):\n    owner = serializers.IntegerField(required=False)\n    class Meta:\n        model = models.FavoriteList\n```\n\nAfter adding `serializer_class = serializers.FavoriteListSerializer` to the ViewSet, I am no longer getting `This field is required` error, but instead I am getting `This field cannot be null.` I have verified that the pre_save method is not being executed. Do you have any ideas to solve this issue?"

        "content": "To address the issue you're facing with the non-nullable field in your Django REST Framework (DRF) serializer, let's go through a structured approach to resolve it:\n\n1. **Understand the Error**: The error message \"This field cannot be null\" indicates that the field is non-nullable in your database, and you're trying to save a record without providing a value for this field.\n\n2. **Pre_save Method**: The `pre_save` method is a Django model method that is executed before a model instance is saved. However, in DRF, it is recommended to use serializer methods for this purpose, like `validate` or `create`/`update`.\n\n3. **Serializer `validate` Method**: You can override the `validate` method in your serializer to set default values or modify data before validation. However, since this happens before the data is validated, it might not be the best place to modify a field that needs to be saved.\n\n4. **Serializer `create` Method**: Since you want to set a field just before saving, you should override the `create` method in your serializer. This is where you can set or modify fields just before the instance is saved.\n\nHere's how you can modify your serializer to use the `create` method:\n\n```python\nclass FavoriteListSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):\n    owner = serializers.IntegerField(required=False)\n\n    class Meta:\n        model = models.FavoriteList\n        fields = '__all__'  # Be sure to include all necessary fields\n\n    def create(self, validated_data):\n        # Set the owner field if it's not present in the validated data\n        if 'owner' not in validated_data:\n            validated_data['owner'] = self.context['request'].user.id  # Example of setting owner from request\n\n        return super(FavoriteListSerializer, self).create(validated_data)\n```\n\n5. **Ensure `ViewSet` Configuration**: Make sure your ViewSet is set up correctly to pass the request context to the serializer, as it may be needed to access the current user or other request-specific information.\n\n```python\nfrom rest_framework import viewsets\n\nclass FavoriteListViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):\n    queryset = models.FavoriteList.objects.all()\n    serializer_class = FavoriteListSerializer\n\n    def get_serializer_context(self):\n        return {'request': self.request}\n```\n\n6. **Database Field Definition**: Ensure that your model field allows for the data you're trying to set (e.g., correct type, not null constraint).\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to populate the non-nullable field as needed before the instance is saved to the database. Adjust the logic in the `create` method to fit your specific use case for setting the field value."
