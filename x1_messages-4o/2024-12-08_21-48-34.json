        "content": "To find the average of the highest 5 numbers given that the total sum of all numbers assigned to the 25 students is 2,000, we can use a logical approach.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the average of all 25 numbers:\n\\[\n\\text{Average of all numbers} = \\frac{\\text{Total sum}}{\\text{Number of students}} = \\frac{2000}{25} = 80\n\\]\n\nThis means that the average number assigned to each student is 80. \n\nNow, consider the highest 5 numbers. To maximize these numbers while keeping the total sum 2,000, we should minimize the other 20 numbers as much as possible. The minimum value for any number is 1.\n\nIf the lowest 20 numbers are as small as possible (say, all equal to 1), the sum of these 20 numbers would be:\n\\[\n20 \\times 1 = 20\n\\]\n\nNow, subtract this sum from the total sum to find the sum of the highest 5 numbers:\n\\[\n\\text{Sum of the highest 5 numbers} = 2000 - 20 = 1980\n\\]\n\nIf the sum of the highest 5 numbers is 1980, we can calculate their average:\n\\[\n\\text{Average of the highest 5 numbers} = \\frac{1980}{5} = 396\n\\]\n\nThus, the average of the highest 5 numbers is 396, assuming the lowest 20 numbers are minimized to 1 for maximizing the highest 5 numbers."
