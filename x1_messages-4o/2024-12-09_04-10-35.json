Is there any alternative to Flask that I can use?"

        "content": "It looks like you're encountering a common issue where the script file is named `flask.py`, which conflicts with the actual Flask package. When Python tries to import Flask, it inadvertently imports your script file instead of the Flask library, leading to the import error.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can rename your script file to something other than `flask.py`. For example, you could rename it to `app.py` or `my_flask_app.py`. Once you've renamed the file, try running your code again.\n\nIf you still want to explore alternatives to Flask, there are several other web frameworks in Python you can consider:\n\n1. **Django**: A full-featured web framework that's suitable for larger applications with more complex requirements.\n\n2. **FastAPI**: Known for its speed and performance, FastAPI is excellent for building APIs quickly.\n\n3. **Bottle**: A lightweight and simple micro-framework, similar to Flask, suitable for small applications.\n\n4. **Tornado**: An asynchronous framework that can handle large numbers of simultaneous connections, suitable for real-time web services.\n\n5. **CherryPy**: An object-oriented web framework that allows you to build web applications in a similar manner to writing Python programs.\n\nEach framework has its strengths and can be chosen based on your project requirements and personal preference. However, Flask is a great choice for small to medium-sized applications due to its simplicity and flexibility."
