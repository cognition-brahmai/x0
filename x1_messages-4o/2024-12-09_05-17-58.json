        "content": "The error you're encountering indicates that the `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` requires the PyTorch library, but it seems like your environment is not recognizing it, even though you have it installed. This issue could be due to several reasons, such as incorrect installation, environment misconfiguration, or path issues. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the problem:\n\n1. **Verify PyTorch Installation:**\n   Make sure PyTorch is installed correctly by running the following command in your environment:\n   ```bash\n   python -c \"import torch; print(torch.__version__)\"\n   ```\n   This should print out the version of PyTorch you have installed. If you encounter an error, you'll need to reinstall PyTorch.\n\n2. **Check Environment:**\n   Ensure that you are working in the correct Python environment where PyTorch is installed. If you are using a virtual environment or conda environment, make sure it's activated.\n\n3. **Reinstall PyTorch:**\n   If the above verification fails, try reinstalling PyTorch. Use the appropriate command based on your system configuration (CUDA version, etc.). For example:\n   ```bash\n   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio\n   ```\n   Or for conda:\n   ```bash\n   conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch\n   ```\n\n4. **Check Library Path:**\n   Ensure that the `PYTHONPATH` is correctly set to include the location where PyTorch and other packages are installed. You can print the `sys.path` in Python to check this:\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   print(sys.path)\n   ```\n\n5. **Restart Environment:**\n   Sometimes, simply restarting your Python environment or IDE (like Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm, etc.) can resolve the issue.\n\n6. **Update Transformers Library:**\n   Ensure that your `transformers` library is up to date, as compatibility issues can sometimes cause problems. You can update it using:\n   ```bash\n   pip install --upgrade transformers\n   ```\n\n7. **Check for Conflicting Libraries:**\n   Check if there are any conflicting libraries that might be causing issues. This can happen if there are multiple installations of similar packages.\n\nAfter following these steps, try running your code again. If the issue persists, there might be a more specific problem related to your environment setup, and you might want to provide additional details or error logs for further assistance."
