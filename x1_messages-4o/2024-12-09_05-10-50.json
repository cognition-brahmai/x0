Could you suggest a way to correct this issue?"

        "content": "The warnings you are encountering from `classification_report` typically occur when there are labels in your true or predicted arrays that do not have corresponding samples. Here are a few steps you can take to diagnose and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check for mismatched labels**: Make sure that all the classes present in `y_test` are also present in `y_pred`. If you have any classes in `y_test` that are not predicted at all, this will trigger the warning.\n\n2. **Ensure consistent data types**: The issue likely isn't due to using `np.array` itself, but it's worth ensuring that your arrays are of the appropriate type and shape. You can check the unique labels in both arrays with:\n    ```python\n    print(\"Unique labels in y_test:\", np.unique(y_test))\n    print(\"Unique labels in y_pred:\", np.unique(y_pred))\n    ```\n\n3. **Use `zero_division` parameter**: You can handle divisions by zero gracefully by using the `zero_division` parameter in `classification_report`:\n    ```python\n    poly = classification_report(y_test, y_pred, zero_division=0)\n    ```\n\n4. **Inspect your model predictions**: The warnings suggest that some classes in `y_test` have no corresponding predictions in `y_pred`. This might indicate that your model is not predicting certain classes at all. You may need to adjust your model parameters or consider balancing your training data if you are dealing with imbalanced classes.\n\n5. **Provide all classes**: If you know all the possible classes beforehand, you can specify them explicitly in `classification_report`:\n    ```python\n    poly = classification_report(y_test, y_pred, labels=[list_of_all_classes], zero_division=0)\n    ```\n\n6. **Evaluate with a confusion matrix**: Consider using a confusion matrix to better understand which classes are being misclassified or not predicted:\n    ```python\n    from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\n    cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)\n    print(\"Confusion Matrix:\\n\", cm)\n    ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify the root cause of the warnings and adjust your approach to handle the classification report generation appropriately."
