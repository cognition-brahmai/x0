I want the loss of both functions to have the same scale, the training and validation slope to be similar and predict_proba(X) to return probabilities. However, my current code is not achieving this. The slope is not smooth when I use my objective, loglikelihood. I also need to apply sigmoid to model.predict_proba(X) to get probabilities for loglikelihood. Can someone help me understand why these differences occur and how I can get the same behavior with a custom loss function?\n\nHere's the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nimport sklearn.datasets\nimport lightgbm as lgb\nimport numpy as np\n\nX, y = sklearn.datasets.load_iris(return_X_y=True)\nX, y = X[y <= 1], y[y <= 1]\n\ndef loglikelihood(labels, preds):\n    preds = 1. / (1. + np.exp(-preds))\n    grad = preds - labels\n    hess = preds * (1. - preds)\n    return grad, hess\n\nmodel = lgb.LGBMClassifier(objective=loglikelihood)  # or \"binary\"\nmodel.fit(X, y, eval_set=[(X, y)], eval_metric=\"binary_logloss\")\nlgb.plot_metric(model.evals_result_)\n```"

        "content": "Creating a custom loss function in LightGBM to mimic the behavior of the built-in binary classification objective can be challenging, especially when it comes to ensuring that the predictions are on the probability scale and that the training and validation metrics behave similarly.\n\nHere are a few steps and tips to help you align your custom loss function with the built-in binary objective:\n\n1. **Ensure Correct Gradient and Hessian Calculation**:\n   - Your current implementation of `loglikelihood` seems correct for a logistic loss. However, ensure that the gradient and Hessian calculations are accurate and consistent with LightGBM's expectations.\n   - In a binary classification context, the gradient (`grad`) should be the difference between the predicted probabilities and the true labels. The Hessian (`hess`) should be the variance of the Bernoulli distribution, which is `preds * (1 - preds)`.\n\n2. **Scaling and Initialization**:\n   - LightGBM's built-in binary objective might have specific initializations and scaling applied internally. Make sure your custom objective's outputs are on the same scale as the built-in objective. You might need to adjust the learning rate or the initial prediction values.\n\n3. **Probability Calibration**:\n   - Ensure that `model.predict_proba(X)` returns probabilities. If the scale of predictions from your custom objective doesn't match, you might need to apply a sigmoid transformation to the raw scores.\n\n4. **Consistency in Evaluation**:\n   - When using a custom loss, ensure that the evaluation metric (`binary_logloss` in this case) is calculated correctly. This might involve ensuring the predictions are on the correct scale before passing them to the evaluation function.\n\n5. **Plotting and Interpretation**:\n   - When plotting the metric, ensure that the evaluation metric is being calculated on the same scale for both your custom objective and the built-in one. Discrepancies might arise if the evaluation metric interprets the predictions differently.\n\nHere's a revised version of your code with some adjustments:\n\n```python\nimport sklearn.datasets\nimport lightgbm as lgb\nimport numpy as np\n\nX, y = sklearn.datasets.load_iris(return_X_y=True)\nX, y = X[y <= 1], y[y <= 1]\n\ndef loglikelihood(labels, preds):\n    preds = 1. / (1. + np.exp(-preds))  # Sigmoid transformation\n    grad = preds - labels\n    hess = preds * (1. - preds)\n    return grad, hess\n\nmodel = lgb.LGBMClassifier(objective=loglikelihood, verbose=-1)  # Custom objective\nmodel.fit(X, y, eval_set=[(X, y)], eval_metric=\"binary_logloss\", verbose=False)\n\n# Plot the evaluation metric\nlgb.plot_metric(model.evals_result_)\n\n# Predict probabilities\nprobabilities = model.predict_proba(X)[:, 1]  # Get probabilities for the positive class\nprint(probabilities)\n```\n\nBy ensuring that your custom loss function's predictions are consistent with how LightGBM expects them, you should be able to get more similar behavior to the built-in binary classification objective. If you continue to experience issues, consider inspecting the raw predictions and comparing them with those from the built-in objective to identify potential discrepancies."
