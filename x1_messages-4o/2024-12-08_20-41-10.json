        "content": "To format the sentence \"He smiles when she looks at him\" in LaTeX using the shell command, you can use echo to create a simple LaTeX document, then compile it with a tool like `pdflatex`. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Open your terminal or command prompt.\n2. Use the following shell command:\n\n```bash\necho \"\\documentclass{article}\n\\begin{document}\nHe smiles when she looks at him.\n\\end{document}\" > smile.tex\npdflatex smile.tex\n```\n\nThis command creates a LaTeX file named `smile.tex` with the sentence, then compiles it into a PDF using `pdflatex`.\n\n### Examples of Similar Sentence Structures in LaTeX\n\nHere are a few examples of sentences with similar structures and how to format them using shell commands:\n\n#### Example 1: \"The cat purrs when it is happy.\"\n\n```bash\necho \"\\documentclass{article}\n\\begin{document}\nThe cat purrs when it is happy.\n\\end{document}\" > cat.tex\npdflatex cat.tex\n```\n\n#### Example 2: \"She dances when the music plays.\"\n\n```bash\necho \"\\documentclass{article}\n\\begin{document}\nShe dances when the music plays.\n\\end{document}\" > dance.tex\npdflatex dance.tex\n```\n\n#### Example 3: \"He laughs when he hears a joke.\"\n\n```bash\necho \"\\documentclass{article}\n\\begin{document}\nHe laughs when he hears a joke.\n\\end{document}\" > laugh.tex\npdflatex laugh.tex\n```\n\nEach of these examples follows the same structure: a main action clause followed by a subordinate clause introduced by \"when.\" The shell commands create a LaTeX document for each sentence and compile it into a PDF file. You can replace the sentence content as needed while maintaining the LaTeX syntax for document formatting."
