My current code reads the content as a byte stream, but I am unable to search it for a Unicode string. How can I modify my code so that when I use `urlopen` and then read, it uses the charset from the headers to decode the content and encode it into UTF-8?\n\nHere's my current code:\n```python\nimport urllib2\n\nreq = urllib2.urlopen('http://lenta.ru')\ncontent = req.read()\n```"

Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n1. Use the `Content-Type` header to determine the encoding.\n2. Decode the byte stream using this encoding.\n3. Encode the decoded content into UTF-8 if needed.\n\nHere is the updated code:\n\n```python\nimport urllib2\n\n# Open the URL\nreq = urllib2.urlopen('http://lenta.ru')\n\n# Get the headers and look for the charset in the Content-Type header\ncontent_type = req.headers.get('Content-Type')\ncharset = 'utf-8'  # Default encoding\n\nif 'charset=' in content_type:\n    charset = content_type.split('charset=')[-1]\n\n# Read the content and decode it using the detected charset\ncontent = req.read().decode(charset)\n\n# Now the content is a Unicode string and you can search using Unicode strings\nsearch_string = u\"your_unicode_string\"\nif search_string in content:\n    print(\"String found!\")\nelse:\n    print(\"String not found.\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Content-Type Header**: It often includes the charset information which you can use to decode the bytes into a string.\n- **Default Encoding**: If the charset is not specified, you can default to 'utf-8', which is commonly used for many websites.\n- **Unicode Strings**: Make sure the string you are searching for is a Unicode string (prefix it with `u` in Python 2).\n\nThis approach will allow you to correctly handle different languages and character encodings when fetching and processing web content."
