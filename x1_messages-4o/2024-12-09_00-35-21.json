For a function or a class, I know that I can put a string just after the definition to document it, as in the following example:\n\n```python\ndef foo():\n    \"\"\"This function does nothing.\"\"\"\n    pass\n```\nBut how do I document what an entire Python file (or module) does?"

        "content": "To document an entire Python module, you can include a module-level docstring at the very top of the file, before any imports or code. A module-level docstring provides an overview of what the module does, its purpose, and any important information that users of the module should know.\n\nHere is an example of how you can document a Python module:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nThis module provides utilities for basic arithmetic operations.\n\nFunctions:\n- add(a, b): Returns the sum of a and b.\n- subtract(a, b): Returns the difference of a and b.\n- multiply(a, b): Returns the product of a and b.\n- divide(a, b): Returns the quotient of a and b. Raises ZeroDivisionError if b is zero.\n\nExample usage:\n>>> from arithmetic import add, subtract\n>>> add(2, 3)\n5\n>>> subtract(5, 2)\n3\n\"\"\"\n\ndef add(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Return the sum of a and b.\"\"\"\n    return a + b\n\ndef subtract(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Return the difference of a and b.\"\"\"\n    return a - b\n\ndef multiply(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Return the product of a and b.\"\"\"\n    return a * b\n\ndef divide(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Return the quotient of a and b. Raises ZeroDivisionError if b is zero.\"\"\"\n    if b == 0:\n        raise ZeroDivisionError(\"division by zero\")\n    return a / b\n```\n\nIn this example, the module-level docstring provides an overview of the module's functionality, lists the available functions, and even includes a brief example of how to use the module. This kind of documentation is helpful for anyone who might use or maintain your code in the future."
