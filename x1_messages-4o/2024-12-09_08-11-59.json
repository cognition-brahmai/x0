I'm using the following code: `df.loc[df.a.isin(['Apple', 'Pear', 'Mango']), ['a', 'b', 'f', 'g']]`. However, this is generating a FutureWarning with the release 0.21.0 of Pandas. The warning message is: \"Passing list-likes to .loc or [] with any missing label will raise KeyError in the future, you can use .reindex() as an alternative.\" What is the correct method to slice and filter the dataframe now?"

        "content": "The warning you are encountering suggests that one or more of the column labels specified in your selection might not be present in the DataFrame, which could lead to a `KeyError` in the future versions of Pandas. To ensure that your code doesn't break when a label is missing, you can use the `.reindex()` method, which safely handles missing labels by returning NaN for missing columns.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to use `.reindex()`:\n\n```python\n# Filter the rows based on the condition\nfiltered_rows = df[df.a.isin(['Apple', 'Pear', 'Mango'])]\n\n# Select the desired columns using .reindex()\nselected_columns = filtered_rows.reindex(columns=['a', 'b', 'f', 'g'])\n\n# The result is a DataFrame with the specified rows and columns\nresult = selected_columns\n```\n\nThis approach will not raise an error if any of the specified columns are not present in the DataFrame. Instead, it will include those columns in the result with NaN values. This makes your code more robust to future changes in your DataFrame's structure."
