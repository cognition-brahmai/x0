Here's how you can do it:\n\nFirst, make sure to import numpy and then create a numpy array from your list. After that, you can directly use the array of index positions to extract the required values. Here's the code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Your array\na = np.array([0, 88, 26, 3, 48, 85, 65, 16, 97, 83, 91])\n\n# Index positions you want to extract\nind_pos = [1, 5, 7]\n\n# Extracting the values at the specified index positions\nresult = a[ind_pos]\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\n[88 85 16]\n```\n\nThis method leverages numpy's ability to index arrays using lists or arrays of indices, making the extraction both simple and efficient."
