Due to the default settings of Matplotlib, the Y axis range is set differently for each plot, which makes it difficult to compare the data. I have tried to set the Y axis limits using the `ylim` function from Matplotlib, but I am encountering syntax issues. Here is the code I am working with:\n\n```python\ndf2250.plot(); plt.ylim((100000,500000))\ndf2260.plot()\ndf5.plot()\n```\n\nWhen I include the semicolon after `df2250.plot()`, I get an 'int not callable' error. When I leave it out, I get an 'invalid syntax' error. Could you help me figure out the correct syntax to set the Y axis limits?"

        "content": "Certainly! The issue you're encountering is related to how you're using the semicolon and the `plt.ylim()` function. In Python, the semicolon is typically used to separate multiple statements on a single line, but it can sometimes cause confusion in certain contexts, especially if it's used incorrectly.\n\nHere's how you can set the Y-axis limits correctly:\n\n1. Make sure to import `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt`.\n2. Set the Y-axis limits using `plt.ylim()` after each plot if you want to apply the limits to each plot individually.\n\nHere's the revised code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Plot the first dataframe and set the Y-axis limits\ndf2250.plot()\nplt.ylim((100000, 500000))\n\n# Plot the second dataframe and set the Y-axis limits\ndf2260.plot()\nplt.ylim((100000, 500000))\n\n# Plot the third dataframe and set the Y-axis limits\ndf5.plot()\nplt.ylim((100000, 500000))\n\n# Show the plots\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this corrected version, each plot is followed by a call to `plt.ylim()` to set the Y-axis limits. The `plt.show()` function at the end is used to display the plots in the notebook.\n\nIf you want to apply the same Y-axis limits to all your plots to make them comparable, simply ensure that `plt.ylim()` is called after each plot command, as shown above.\n\nAdditionally, ensure that you have imported the necessary libraries at the beginning of your notebook:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n```\n\nThis should resolve the syntax issues you were encountering."
