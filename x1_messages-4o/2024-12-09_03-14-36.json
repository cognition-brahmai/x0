I recently upgraded my Linux Mint from 17.3 to 18 and since then, I've been getting connection errors. Despite installing all necessary packages such as Java 8 and Python 2.7.12, and trying all versions of Cassandra including the latest release 3.7 (from tarball and Debian package), the error persists. The error message I get is \"Connection error: ('Unable to connect to any servers', {'127.0.0.1': TypeError('ref() does not take keyword arguments',)})\". I've followed the solutions provided in this post and the Cassandra documentation, but nothing seems to work. I suspect the problem could be in the cassandra.yaml file since the default setting isn't working. How do I properly configure it to get it running?"

        "content": "It sounds like you're experiencing a tricky issue with your Cassandra setup. Here are some steps and considerations that might help you resolve the connection error:\n\n1. **Check Cassandra Service**: Ensure that the Cassandra service is running. You can start it using:\n   ```bash\n   sudo service cassandra start\n   ```\n   or\n   ```bash\n   cassandra -f\n   ```\n   to run it in the foreground and see any error messages.\n\n2. **Verify Java Version**: Since you've upgraded your system, ensure that the correct Java version is being used. Check the Java version with:\n   ```bash\n   java -version\n   ```\n   Cassandra 3.7 requires Java 8. Make sure that the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set correctly.\n\n3. **Cassandra.yaml Configuration**:\n   - **listen_address**: Set this to your server's IP address or `0.0.0.0` if you want to accept connections on all interfaces. If running locally, you might want to keep it as `localhost`.\n   - **rpc_address**: This is usually set to `localhost` for local testing. However, if you're connecting from another machine, set it to the server's IP address or `0.0.0.0`.\n   - **native_transport_port**: Ensure it's set to the default `9042`, unless you've changed it deliberately.\n\n4. **Firewall and Network Settings**: Ensure that port `9042` is open and not blocked by a firewall. You can check your firewall settings using tools like `ufw`:\n   ```bash\n   sudo ufw status\n   ```\n\n5. **Check Python Version and Dependencies**: Since cqlsh is a Python script, ensure that the correct version of Python is being used. It should be compatible with Python 2.7.12. Also, check that all necessary Python packages are installed:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install python-pip\n   pip install cql\n   ```\n\n6. **CQLSH Configuration**: Look in the `~/.cassandra/cqlshrc` file for any misconfigurations. You might need to set the host and port explicitly there.\n\n7. **Check for IP Binding Issues**: If you're using a virtual machine or Docker, make sure the IPs are correctly mapped and bound.\n\n8. **Logs**: Check the Cassandra logs for any errors. These can often provide more insight into what might be going wrong. The logs are typically found in `/var/log/cassandra/system.log`.\n\n9. **Reinstallation**: If none of the above works, consider completely removing Cassandra and reinstalling it. Sometimes, configuration files or dependencies might have become corrupted during the upgrade.\n\nThese steps should guide you in troubleshooting and resolving the connection issues with your Cassandra database. If the problem persists, you might also consider checking community forums for any similar issues related to the specific Linux Mint upgrade you performed."
