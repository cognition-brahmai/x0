        "content": "I have been using the `super()` function in Python and I have some confusion regarding its usage with the `__new__` method. In the first two cases, I can use `super()` successfully without specifying the `obj` or `cls` to operate on. However, in case 3, when I use `super()` with the `__new__` method, I encounter an error. If I modify the code to `super(B, cls).__new__(cls)`, it works without error. Why can't I use `super()` in the same way with `__new__` as with `__init__` and `foo`? \n\nHere is the problematic code:\n\n```python\n#Case 1\nclass A(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        print \"A init\"\n\nclass B(A):\n    def __init__(self):\n        print \"B init\"\n        super(B, self).__init__()  #ok, I can invoke A's __init__ successfully\n\n#Case 2\nclass A(object):\n    @classmethod\n    def foo(cls):\n        print \"A foo\"\n\nclass B(A):\n    @classmethod\n    def foo(cls):\n        print \"B foo\"\n        super(B, cls).foo()   #ok, I can invoke A's foo successfully\n\n#Case 3\nclass A(object):\n    def __new__(cls):\n      print \"A new\"\n      return super(A, cls).__new__(cls)\n\nclass B(A):\n    def __new__(cls):\n      print \"B new\"\n      return super(B, cls).__new__()  #Oops, error\n```"

        "content": "The `super()` function in Python is used to call a method from a parent class, allowing you to invoke methods from a superclass without explicitly naming it. When using `super()`, especially in the context of the `__new__` method, there are specific nuances that need to be considered.\n\nLet's break down each case and understand why the error occurs in the third case:\n\n### Case 1: `__init__` Method\nIn the `__init__` method, you use `super(B, self).__init__()`. This works because `super(B, self)` returns a proxy object that delegates method calls to the next class in the method resolution order (MRO) after `B`. Here, `self` is an instance of `B`, and `super()` determines the context correctly.\n\n### Case 2: Class Method `foo`\nIn class methods, you use `super(B, cls).foo()`. This works similarly to the `__init__` method, where `super(B, cls)` provides a proxy object for class methods. Here, `cls` is the class itself (`B`), and `super()` can resolve the method call correctly because it's a class method call context.\n\n### Case 3: `__new__` Method\nIn the `__new__` method, you initially have `return super(B, cls).__new__()`, which causes an error. This happens because the `__new__` method is a static method that constructs an instance of a class. When calling `super().__new__()`, you need to specify the class since `__new__` is responsible for creating an instance of the class. In this context, `super(B, cls)` needs to be explicitly told the class (`cls`) to which it applies.\n\n#### Why the Error Occurs\n- `super(B, cls).__new__()` is missing the `cls` argument in the call to `__new__`. Since `__new__` is responsible for creating a new instance, it requires the class as the first argument.\n  \n#### Corrected Code\nTo fix the error, you should explicitly pass `cls` to `__new__`:\n\n```python\nclass A(object):\n    def __new__(cls):\n        print(\"A new\")\n        return super(A, cls).__new__(cls)\n\nclass B(A):\n    def __new__(cls):\n        print(\"B new\")\n        return super(B, cls).__new__(cls)  # Pass cls explicitly\n```\n\n### Key Points\n- `__new__` is a static method and needs the class (`cls`) as the first argument.\n- `super()` needs to be properly informed about the class context, especially in `__new__`, to correctly resolve the method call in the inheritance chain.\n- The error is due to missing the `cls` argument in the `__new__` method call through `super()`.\n\nBy ensuring the correct arguments and understanding the context of `super()`, you can effectively use it in constructors and class methods."
