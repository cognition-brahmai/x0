Since I don't have access to the dataset, I can't compute the mean directly. However, I can show you a template in Excel format on how you might organize your data and calculate the mean if you have the dataset.\n\nHere's how you might set up an Excel table:\n\n| Record ID | Income |\n|-----------|--------|\n| 1         | 35000  |\n| 2         | 42000  |\n| 3         | 50000  |\n| ...       | ...    |\n| 500       | 60000  |\n\nAnd to calculate the mean income, you can use the following formula in Excel:\n\n1. **Sum of Income**: Use the formula `=SUM(B2:B501)` assuming your income data is in column B from row 2 to row 501.\n2. **Mean Income**: Use the formula `=AVERAGE(B2:B501)`.\n\nThis will give you the mean income of all 500 records. Just replace the range with the actual range of your dataset."
