        "content": "Certainly! Here's an example of a complex sentence with an embedded clause:\n\n**Example Sentence:**  \n\"The scientist, who had been researching the phenomenon for years, finally made a groundbreaking discovery.\"\n\n**Explanation with [English grammar rules] data format:**\n\n1. **Main Clause:**  \n   - \"The scientist finally made a groundbreaking discovery.\"\n   - Main clauses can stand alone as a sentence.\n\n2. **Embedded Clause (Relative Clause):**  \n   - \"who had been researching the phenomenon for years\"\n   - A relative clause provides additional information about a noun (in this case, \"the scientist\").\n\n3. **Comma Usage:**  \n   - Commas are used to set off non-restrictive (non-essential) clauses, which add extra information but are not essential to the meaning of the sentence.\n   - Since the embedded clause \"who had been researching the phenomenon for years\" is non-restrictive (the sentence would still be complete and make sense without it), it is enclosed in commas.\n\nBy formatting the sentence in this way, the embedded clause is clearly indicated, and the use of commas helps to distinguish the additional information from the main clause, enhancing the readability and comprehension of the sentence."
