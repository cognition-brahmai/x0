For instance, in the standard method we use:\n\n```python\nf = open('x.txt')\ncts = f.read()\nf.close()\n```\nIs there a more efficient or shorter method to achieve the same result?"

Here is a one-liner that achieves what you want:\n\n```python\ncontents = open('x.txt').read()\n```\n\nHowever, using a `with` statement is generally more recommended for better resource management:\n\n```python\nwith open('x.txt') as f:\n    contents = f.read()\n```\n\nThis is still quite concise and ensures that the file is properly closed after reading, which is a good practice to prevent any potential resource leaks."
