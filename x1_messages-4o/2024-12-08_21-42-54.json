        "content": "Certainly! To find synonyms for a given word in Scala, you can use an API like the Datamuse API or any other synonym service. Below is an example using the Datamuse API to find synonyms for a word like \"despot\". You will need to have an internet connection for this to work, as it makes an HTTP request to the API.\n\nFirst, you'll need to include a JSON library and an HTTP client for making requests. Here, I'll use `sttp` for HTTP requests and `uPickle` for JSON parsing.\n\nAdd the following dependencies to your `build.sbt` file:\n\n```sbt\nlibraryDependencies += \"com.softwaremill.sttp.client3\" %% \"core\" % \"3.3.16\"\nlibraryDependencies += \"com.lihaoyi\" %% \"upickle\" % \"1.4.0\"\n```\n\nThen, you can use the following Scala code:\n\n```scala\nimport sttp.client3._\nimport upickle.default._\n\nobject SynonymFinder {\n\n  case class Word(word: String)\n\n  implicit val wordReader: Reader[Word] = macroR[Word]\n\n  def findSynonyms(word: String): Seq[String] = {\n    val request = basicRequest\n      .get(uri\"https://api.datamuse.com/words?rel_syn=$word\")\n      .response(asStringAlways)\n\n    val backend = HttpURLConnectionBackend()\n    val response = request.send(backend)\n\n    if (response.code.isSuccess) {\n      val json = response.body\n      try {\n        val words = read[Seq[Word]](json)\n        words.map(_.word)\n      } catch {\n        case e: Exception =>\n          println(s\"Error parsing response: ${e.getMessage}\")\n          Seq.empty\n      }\n    } else {\n      println(s\"Error fetching synonyms: ${response.code}\")\n      Seq.empty\n    }\n  }\n\n  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\n    val word = \"despot\"\n    val synonyms = findSynonyms(word)\n\n    if (synonyms.nonEmpty) {\n      println(s\"Synonyms for '$word': ${synonyms.mkString(\", \")}\")\n    } else {\n      println(s\"No synonyms found for '$word'.\")\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Dependencies**: We use `sttp` for making HTTP requests and `uPickle` for parsing JSON responses.\n\n2. **Data class**: We define a simple case class `Word` to map the JSON object that contains the synonym word.\n\n3. **findSynonyms function**: This function makes a GET request to the Datamuse API to find synonyms for the input word. It parses the JSON response into a sequence of `Word` objects and extracts the words.\n\n4. **Main function**: The `main` function takes the word \"despot\" and prints its synonyms.\n\nMake sure to adjust the `build.sbt` file with the correct versions of the dependencies as needed. Additionally, handling of HTTP errors and JSON parsing exceptions is included for robustness."
