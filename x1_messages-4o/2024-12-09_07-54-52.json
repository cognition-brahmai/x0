        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that you're trying to use a module that's specific to Google Colaboratory (Colab) in an environment that doesn't have it installed. The `google.colab` module is pre-installed in Google Colab environments but is not available in other environments by default, such as local Jupyter notebooks or other Python environments.\n\nTo access Google Drive files using Python outside of Google Colab, you can use the `pydrive` or `google-auth` libraries. Here's how you can set it up:\n\n### Method 1: Using `PyDrive`\n\n1. **Install PyDrive:**\n   Ensure you have the `PyDrive` library installed. You can install it using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install PyDrive\n   ```\n\n2. **Authenticate and Access Files:**\n\n   You will need to set up OAuth2 authentication. Here's a simple example:\n\n   ```python\n   from pydrive.auth import GoogleAuth\n   from pydrive.drive import GoogleDrive\n\n   # Create a GoogleAuth object\n   gauth = GoogleAuth()\n\n   # Try to load saved client credentials\n   gauth.LoadCredentialsFile(\"mycreds.txt\")\n\n   if gauth.credentials is None:\n       # Authenticate if they're not there\n       gauth.LocalWebserverAuth()\n\n   elif gauth.access_token_expired:\n       # Refresh them if expired\n       gauth.Refresh()\n   \n   else:\n       # Initialize the saved creds\n       gauth.Authorize()\n\n   # Save the current credentials to a file\n   gauth.SaveCredentialsFile(\"mycreds.txt\")\n\n   # Create GoogleDrive instance with authenticated GoogleAuth instance\n   drive = GoogleDrive(gauth)\n\n   # List files in your Google Drive\n   file_list = drive.ListFile({'q': \"'root' in parents and trashed=false\"}).GetList()\n   for file in file_list:\n       print('title: %s, id: %s' % (file['title'], file['id']))\n   ```\n\n3. **Download or Upload Files:**\n\n   You can use the `drive.CreateFile()` method to upload or download files from your Google Drive.\n\n### Method 2: Using `google-auth`\n\nIf you prefer using `google-auth`, here\u2019s a basic setup:\n\n1. **Install Required Libraries:**\n   \n   ```bash\n   pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client\n   ```\n\n2. **Authenticate and Access Files:**\n\n   ```python\n   from google.oauth2 import service_account\n   from googleapiclient.discovery import build\n\n   # Set up the credentials using a service account\n   SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive']\n   SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = 'path/to/your/service-account-file.json'\n\n   credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(\n       SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE, scopes=SCOPES)\n\n   # Build the Drive service\n   drive_service = build('drive', 'v3', credentials=credentials)\n\n   # List files in your Google Drive\n   results = drive_service.files().list(\n       pageSize=10, fields=\"nextPageToken, files(id, name)\").execute()\n   items = results.get('files', [])\n\n   if not items:\n       print('No files found.')\n   else:\n       print('Files:')\n       for item in items:\n           print(f\"{item['name']} ({item['id']})\")\n   ```\n\nIn both methods, remember to set up proper credentials (OAuth2 client secrets or service account JSON file) and adjust the file paths accordingly. This should allow you to access Google Drive files from your environment."
