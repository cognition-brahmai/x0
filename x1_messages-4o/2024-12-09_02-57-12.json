My data is currently in a 2D numpy array and I am trying to convert it into a list of lists. I have attempted to do this by creating a list from the numpy array, but the result is still a numpy array. I also tried using a for loop to convert each element of the list into a list but I am looking for a more pythonic way to achieve this without using loops. Here is the code I'm working with:\n\n```python\nimport numpy\narray = numpy.ones((2,4))\ndata_list = list(array)\n# data_list: [array([ 1.,  1.,  1.,  1.]), array([ 1.,  1.,  1.,  1.])]\n# type(data_list[0]) is numpy.ndarray, which is not what I want\n\n# non pythonic way using for loop\nnewdata = list()\nfor line in data_list:\n    line = list(line)\n    newdata.append(line)\n# type(newdata[0]) is list, which is what I want\n```"

        "content": "To convert a 2D numpy array into a list of lists in a more Pythonic manner without using explicit loops, you can leverage the `tolist()` method provided by numpy arrays. This method efficiently converts the entire array into a list of lists. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Create a 2D numpy array\narray = np.ones((2, 4))\n\n# Convert the numpy array to a list of lists\ndata_list = array.tolist()\n\n# data_list is now [[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]]\n# type(data_list[0]) will be list\n```\n\nThis approach is both concise and efficient, as it directly leverages numpy's built-in functionality to perform the conversion."
