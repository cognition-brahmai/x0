U@ U# u '\nprint re.sub (' [u|U][s,.,?,!,W,#,@ (^a-zA-Z)]', ' you ', text)\n```\nThe output I get is:\n\n```python\nhow are you  you berella you  you  you  you  you  you\n```\nAs you can see, 'umberella' is incorrectly changed to 'youberella'. Moreover, I want to keep the character that appears after a 'u', so 'u!' should be changed to 'you!'. What am I doing wrong and how should I write the regular expression?"

        "content": "It looks like you want to replace standalone 'u' or 'U' with 'you' while preserving the character that follows 'u' or 'U', and ensuring that words like 'umberella' are not affected. The main issue in your regular expression is the character set and its usage. Let's fix it:\n\n1. You should use word boundaries `\\b` to ensure that you are only targeting standalone 'u' or 'U'.\n2. You should capture the character that follows 'u' or 'U' and retain it in the substitution.\n\nHere's how you can modify your regular expression to achieve the desired outcome:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ntext = 'how are u? umberella u! u. U. U@ U# u '\n# Use \\b for word boundaries and capture the following non-space character if it exists\nresult = re.sub(r'\\b[uU]\\b(?=\\W)', 'you', text)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s changed:\n- `\\b[uU]\\b`: This ensures that 'u' or 'U' is a whole word (bounded by non-word characters or the start/end of a string).\n- `(?=\\W)`: A positive lookahead that ensures there is a non-word character following the 'u' or 'U'.\n\nThis should give you the desired output:\n\n```\nhow are you? umberella you! you. you. you@ you# you \n```\n\nBy using the word boundary `\\b`, you ensure that only standalone 'u' or 'U' are replaced. The lookahead `(?=\\W)` makes sure that the next character is a non-word character, so you correctly handle punctuation and spaces."
