I've followed the instructions on the PyAudio homepage and successfully installed portaudio using the commands 'brew install portaudio' and 'pip install pyaudio'. I can confirm that the installation of portaudio was successful as I can find the headers and libs in /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib. However, when I attempt to install pyaudio, I receive an error message stating 'portaudio.h' file not found. The exact error is as follows:\n\nsrc/_portaudiomodule.c:29:10: fatal error: 'portaudio.h' file not found\n#include \"portaudio.h\"\n         ^\n1 error generated.\nerror: command 'cc' failed with exit status 1\n\nThe file 'portaudio.h' is in /usr/local/include, so I'm not sure why it can't be found. I've tried solutions from similar questions such as using virtualenv, or compiling it manually, but these methods aren't working for me. I'm looking for a simple solution to this issue. Can you help?"

        "content": "It looks like the issue might be related to the compiler not being able to locate the header files for `portaudio` during the installation of `PyAudio`. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Homebrew is up-to-date:**\n   Make sure your Homebrew installation is updated and upgrade any outdated packages:\n   ```bash\n   brew update\n   brew upgrade\n   ```\n\n2. **Set environment variables:**\n   You may need to set the `CFLAGS` and `LDFLAGS` environment variables so that the compiler can find the header files and libraries. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:\n   ```bash\n   export CFLAGS=\"-I/usr/local/include\"\n   export LDFLAGS=\"-L/usr/local/lib\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Reinstall PyAudio with the updated environment variables:**\n   With the environment variables set, try reinstalling PyAudio using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall pyaudio\n   pip install pyaudio\n   ```\n\n4. **Try installing PyAudio with Homebrew:**\n   Homebrew can sometimes handle dependencies better. Try installing PyAudio using Homebrew if the above steps don't work:\n   ```bash\n   brew install pyaudio\n   ```\n\n5. **Check symlinks:**\n   Ensure that the symlinks are correctly set in `/usr/local/include` and `/usr/local/lib`. You can check this by running:\n   ```bash\n   ls -l /usr/local/include/portaudio.h\n   ls -l /usr/local/lib/libportaudio.dylib\n   ```\n\n6. **Verify your Python environment:**\n   If you are using a virtual environment, make sure it is activated before you try to install PyAudio. Virtual environments can sometimes have their own path settings.\n\n7. **Manual Installation:**\n   If none of the above works, you might want to manually specify the paths during installation using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install pyaudio --global-option=build_ext --global-option=\"-I/usr/local/include\" --global-option=\"-L/usr/local/lib\"\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with finding `portaudio.h` during the installation of PyAudio on your Mac OS X 10.10 system."
