For instance, when I use this piece of code:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Hello? Anyone there?\")\n```\nIt doesn't appear in the regular logs. The logs are showing output from other libraries in my application, but not from my own print calls. How can I avoid my `print()` calls being ignored?"

        "content": "When you run a Python application inside a Docker container and observe that `print()` statements are not appearing in the logs, it's often due to how Python handles buffering for standard output (`stdout`). By default, Python buffers output to `stdout`, which means it may not immediately appear in the logs. Here's how you can address this issue:\n\n1. **Disable Output Buffering**: You can disable output buffering by setting the `PYTHONUNBUFFERED` environment variable to `1`. This forces Python to flush the output directly to the console without buffering.\n\n   You can do this in your `docker-compose.yml` file by adding the environment variable:\n\n   ```yaml\n   version: '3'\n   services:\n     my_service:\n       image: my_image\n       environment:\n         - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1\n       # Other configurations\n   ```\n\n2. **Directly Flush `stdout` in Python**: If you prefer to handle it within your Python code, you can explicitly flush `stdout` after each `print()` call:\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   \n   print(\"Hello? Anyone there?\", flush=True)\n   ```\n\n3. **Use `sys.stdout`**: Another approach is to write directly to `sys.stdout` and flush it:\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n\n   sys.stdout.write(\"Hello? Anyone there?\\n\")\n   sys.stdout.flush()\n   ```\n\n4. **Run Python with `-u` Option**: When you start your Python application, you can use the `-u` flag to run Python in unbuffered mode. Modify your Dockerfile or entrypoint script to include this option:\n\n   ```bash\n   CMD [\"python\", \"-u\", \"your_script.py\"]\n   ```\n\nBy applying one of these methods, you should be able to see your `print()` statements in the Docker container logs."
