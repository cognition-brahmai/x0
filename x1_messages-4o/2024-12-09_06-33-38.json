I am familiar with Django and I know that in Django you can use {% now \"Y\" %} to display the current year. Is there a similar way to do this in Flask? I have not been able to find a solution in my research so far."

        "content": "In Flask, you can achieve similar functionality by leveraging Jinja2, which is the templating engine used by Flask. While Flask doesn't have a built-in tag like Django's `{% now \"Y\" %}`, you can easily pass the current year from your Flask view to the template context and then display it in your template.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:\n\n1. **Import the `datetime` module in your Flask view:**\n\n   You can use Python's `datetime` module to get the current year.\n\n2. **Pass the current year to the template context:**\n\n   Modify your Flask route to include the current year in the context.\n\n3. **Display the year in your template:**\n\n   Access the current year variable in your HTML template.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n\n**Flask View (app.py):**\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template\nimport datetime\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef home():\n    current_year = datetime.datetime.now().year\n    return render_template('index.html', year=current_year)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n**Template (templates/index.html):**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Current Year</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>The current year is {{ year }}</h1>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nIn this example, the `home` route calculates the current year using `datetime.datetime.now().year` and passes it to the `index.html` template as the `year` variable. In the template, you can then use `{{ year }}` to display the value.\n\nThis approach is flexible and allows you to add other dynamic data to your templates as needed."
