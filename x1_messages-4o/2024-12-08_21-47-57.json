Then we can calculate the average speed using the formula:\nAverage speed = total distance \u00f7 total time\nTo calculate the total distance, we need to break down the journey into three parts and add up the distances traveled in each part:\nDistance traveled in the first 20% of the journey = 0.2D\nDistance traveled in the next 30% of the journey = 0.3D\nDistance traveled in the remaining 50% of the journey = 0.5D\nSo, the total distance traveled is:\nTotal distance = 0.2D + 0.3D + 0.5D = D km\nTo calculate the total time, we need to calculate the time taken for each part of the journey and add them up:\nTime taken in the first 20% of the journey = (0.2D) \u00f7 (0.5S \u00d7 0.5) = 0.8D \u00f7 S hour\nTime taken in the next 30% of the journey = (0.3D) \u00f7 (1.3S \u00d7 0.5) = 0.46D \u00f7 S hour\nTime taken in the remaining 50% of the journey = (0.5D) \u00f7 (0.9S \u00d7 0.5) = 0.56D \u00f7 S hour\nSo, the total time taken is:\nTotal time = (0.8D \u00f7 S) + (0.46D \u00f7 S) + (0.56D \u00f7 S) = 1.82D \u00f7 S hour\nNow we can calculate the average speed:\nAverage speed = D km \u00f7 (1.82D \u00f7 S hour) = (S \u00d7 0.549) km/hour\nRounding this to the nearest integer, we get:\nAverage speed \u2248 0.549S km/hour\nTherefore, if the usual speed of the car is S km/hour, the average speed in kilometers per hour would be approximately 0.549S km/hour."
