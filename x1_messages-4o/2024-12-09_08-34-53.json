        "content": "What is the default batch size of PyTorch's SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)? What happens if I feed the whole dataset into the model and do not specify the batch size? For instance, if I have the following simple code where I input the complete data (x,y) into a model:\n\n```\noptimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.1)  \nfor epoch in range(5):\n    y_pred = model(x_data)\n    loss = criterion(y_pred, y_data)\n    optimizer.zero_grad()\n    loss.backward()\n    optimizer.step()\n```\n\nAssuming there are 100 data pairs (x,y), i.e. x_data and y_data each has 100 elements, it appears to me that all the 100 gradients are calculated before one update of parameters. The size of a \"mini_batch\" is thus 100, not 1. There seems to be no element of randomness here. Am I correct in thinking this? I initially assumed that SGD meant randomly selecting one data point and calculating its gradient, which would then be used as an approximation of the true gradient from all data."

        "content": "In PyTorch, the `torch.optim.SGD` optimizer does not have a default batch size. The batch size is determined by how you feed the data into the model during training. If you provide the entire dataset at once, as in your example, the entire dataset will be used for each iteration of gradient descent. This is technically known as \"batch gradient descent\" rather than \"stochastic gradient descent\" (SGD).\n\nIn your code example, since you pass the entire dataset `x_data` and `y_data` to the model in each iteration, you are effectively doing batch gradient descent with a batch size of 100 (the entire dataset). This means that for each epoch, you calculate the gradient based on all 100 data points, and then update the model parameters accordingly. There is indeed no randomness involved in this process because you are using the whole dataset for each update.\n\nThe term \"stochastic\" in SGD usually refers to the practice of using a single data point or a small random subset of the dataset (mini-batch) to compute the gradient and update the model parameters. This introduces randomness into the training process, potentially allowing the model to converge faster or escape local minima.\n\nIf you want to implement true SGD or mini-batch gradient descent, you would need to split your dataset into smaller batches and iterate over these batches. You can use `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` to create batches from your dataset, and then iterate over these batches in your training loop. For example:\n\n```python\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset\n\n# Assuming x_data and y_data are your input and target tensors\ndataset = TensorDataset(x_data, y_data)\ndataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10, shuffle=True)\n\nfor epoch in range(5):\n    for x_batch, y_batch in dataloader:\n        y_pred = model(x_batch)\n        loss = criterion(y_pred, y_batch)\n        optimizer.zero_grad()\n        loss.backward()\n        optimizer.step()\n```\n\nIn this modified version, the `DataLoader` creates mini-batches of size 10, and the `shuffle=True` option introduces randomness in the order of data points in each epoch, which is a key aspect of SGD."
