        "content": "To perform text analysis on the main theme in \"Romeo and Juliet\" and compare it to other works of Shakespeare using PHP, you'll want to incorporate some natural language processing (NLP) techniques. While PHP is not traditionally used for NLP (Python is more commonly used due to libraries like NLTK and SpaCy), you can still perform some basic operations or leverage external APIs for more advanced analysis.\n\nHere's how you can modify your PHP code to perform a basic text analysis:\n\n1. **Extract Text**: You've already done this part by stripping HTML tags from the content.\n\n2. **Tokenization**: Break down the text into words or sentences.\n\n3. **Stop Words Removal**: Remove common words that are not meaningful in the analysis (e.g., \"the\", \"and\").\n\n4. **Stemming/Lemmatization**: Convert words to their base form.\n\n5. **Frequency Analysis**: Determine the frequency of each word.\n\n6. **Sentiment Analysis**: Optionally, analyze the sentiment of the text.\n\n7. **Comparison**: Compare the frequency and sentiment results between \"Romeo and Juliet\" and other works.\n\nHere's an example of how you can start implementing these steps in PHP:\n\n```php\n<?php\n\nfunction stripPunctuation($text) {\n    return preg_replace('/[^\\w\\s]/', '', $text);\n}\n\nfunction tokenizeText($text) {\n    return explode(' ', $text);\n}\n\nfunction removeStopWords($tokens) {\n    $stopWords = file('stopwords.txt', FILE_IGNORE_NEW_LINES);\n    return array_diff($tokens, $stopWords);\n}\n\nfunction wordFrequency($tokens) {\n    $frequency = array_count_values($tokens);\n    arsort($frequency);\n    return $frequency;\n}\n\n$romeo_and_juliet = file_get_contents(\"http://shakespeare.mit.edu/romeo_juliet/full.html\");\n$shakespeare = file_get_contents(\"http://shakespeare.mit.edu/\");\n\n// Strip HTML tags\n$romeo_and_juliet_text = strip_tags($romeo_and_juliet);\n$shakespeare_text = strip_tags($shakespeare);\n\n// Remove punctuation and tokenize\n$romeo_and_juliet_tokens = tokenizeText(stripPunctuation($romeo_and_juliet_text));\n$shakespeare_tokens = tokenizeText(stripPunctuation($shakespeare_text));\n\n// Remove stop words\n$romeo_and_juliet_tokens = removeStopWords($romeo_and_juliet_tokens);\n$shakespeare_tokens = removeStopWords($shakespeare_tokens);\n\n// Get word frequency\n$romeo_and_juliet_frequency = wordFrequency($romeo_and_juliet_tokens);\n$shakespeare_frequency = wordFrequency($shakespeare_tokens);\n\n// Compare word frequencies\nfunction compareFrequencies($freq1, $freq2) {\n    $comparison = [];\n    foreach ($freq1 as $word => $count) {\n        if (isset($freq2[$word])) {\n            $comparison[$word] = ['romeo_and_juliet' => $count, 'other_works' => $freq2[$word]];\n        }\n    }\n    return $comparison;\n}\n\n$comparison = compareFrequencies($romeo_and_juliet_frequency, $shakespeare_frequency);\n\n// Output comparison\necho \"<pre>\";\nprint_r($comparison);\necho \"</pre>\";\n\n?>\n```\n\n### Notes:\n\n- **Stop Words**: You need a list of stop words in a file named `stopwords.txt` which you can easily find online.\n\n- **Sentiment Analysis**: For sentiment analysis, consider using an external API like TextRazor, Aylien, or Google Cloud's Natural Language API. PHP cURL can be used to send requests to these APIs.\n\n- **Advanced NLP**: For more advanced analysis, consider using a Python script that can be called from PHP. Python libraries like NLTK and SpaCy provide more sophisticated NLP capabilities.\n\nThis code performs basic text processing and frequency comparison. For deeper theme analysis, you might want to explore specific NLP techniques or machine learning models trained on literary themes."
