Here's how you can rewrite your line:\n\n```python\nfield = TreeForeignKey(\n    'self',\n    null=True,\n    blank=True,\n    related_name='abcdefgh'\n)\n```\n\nBy using parentheses, you can spread the arguments of the `TreeForeignKey` constructor over multiple lines, making it more readable and compliant with PEP8."
