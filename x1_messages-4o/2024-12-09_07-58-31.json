Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n```python\n# Assuming 'List' and 'Membership' are related through some field, like 'list' in Membership model\n\n# Get all lists\nalllists = List.objects.filter(datamode='A')\n\n# Get the lists that are subscribed\nsubscribed_list_ids = Membership.objects.filter(\n    member__id=memberid,\n    datamode='A'\n).values_list('list_id', flat=True)\n\n# Exclude the subscribed lists from the all lists to get unsubscription list\nunsubscriptionlist = alllists.exclude(id__in=subscribed_list_ids)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- `values_list('list_id', flat=True)` is used to extract the list of IDs from the `subscriptionlists` queryset.\n- `exclude(id__in=subscribed_list_ids)` is used to exclude records from `alllists` where the `id` matches any of the IDs in `subscribed_list_ids`.\n\nMake sure to replace `'list_id'` with the actual field name that relates the `Membership` model to the `List` model if it's different."
