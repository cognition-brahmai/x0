When I run the following code:\n```python\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot\n```\nI get an error message saying `ImportError: No module named 'tkinter'`. I understand that in Python 2.x it was called Tkinter, but I have just installed a new Python 3.5.1. I also tried to import 'tkinter' and 'Tkinter' but none of these worked and both returned the same error message. How can I resolve this?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to the absence of the `tkinter` module, which is required for some of the backend functionalities of `matplotlib`, especially when using interactive plots. Since you're using Python 3.5.1, the module should be named `tkinter` (all lowercase).\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Install tkinter**: On Windows, `tkinter` should be included with the standard Python installation. However, if it's missing, you might need to ensure that you have a complete Python installation. You can try reinstalling Python and during installation, make sure the `tcl/tk` option is checked.\n\n2. **Verify the Installation**:\n   - Open a command prompt and enter:\n     ```\n     python -m tkinter\n     ```\n   - If `tkinter` is installed correctly, this command should open a small window showing a simple `tkinter` GUI.\n\n3. **Update PATH**: Ensure that Python is correctly added to your system's PATH environment variable. This can be done during the installation or manually through the Environment Variables settings in Windows.\n\n4. **Check Python Version in PyCharm**: Make sure that PyCharm is configured to use the correct Python interpreter where `tkinter` is installed.\n   - Go to `File` > `Settings` (or `Preferences` on macOS)\n   - Navigate to `Project: [Your Project Name]` > `Python Interpreter`\n   - Make sure the interpreter selected is the one where you installed Python and `tkinter`.\n\n5. **Reinstall Python**: If none of the above steps work, consider reinstalling Python. Download the latest Python 3.5.x installer from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-351/), and ensure you check the box to install `tcl/tk` and `IDLE`.\n\nOnce you have `tkinter` properly installed, try running your `matplotlib` code again, and it should work without any issues."
