I was under the impression that the `r` prefix must be used whenever escape sequences are used. The following three examples demonstrate this confusion:\n\n```python\n# example 1\nimport re\nprint (re.sub('\\s+', ' ', 'hello     there      there'))\n# prints 'hello there there' - not expected as r prefix is not used\n\n# example 2\nimport re\nprint (re.sub(r'(\\b\\w+)(\\s+\\1\\b)+', r'\\1', 'hello     there      there'))\n# prints 'hello     there' - as expected as r prefix is used\n\n# example 3\nimport re\nprint (re.sub('(\\b\\w+)(\\s+\\1\\b)+', '\\1', 'hello     there      there'))\n# prints 'hello     there      there' - as expected as r prefix is not used\n```"

        "content": "The confusion arises from how Python handles string literals and escape sequences. Let's break down each example to understand why they behave the way they do.\n\n### Example 1\n\n```python\nimport re\nprint(re.sub('\\s+', ' ', 'hello     there      there'))\n```\n\nIn this example, `\\s` is used within the regular expression pattern. In Python string literals, `\\s` is not a recognized escape sequence, so it is interpreted as `\\` followed by `s`. The regular expression engine interprets `\\s` correctly as a whitespace character. Thus, `\\s+` matches one or more whitespace characters, which is why the substitution works as expected. Using `r'\\s+'` would have the same effect because it also represents a raw string where backslashes are treated literally.\n\n### Example 2\n\n```python\nimport re\nprint(re.sub(r'(\\b\\w+)(\\s+\\1\\b)+', r'\\1', 'hello     there      there'))\n```\n\nHere, both the pattern and the replacement string use raw string literals (`r'...'`). The raw string ensures that all backslashes are treated literally by Python, which is important when dealing with regular expressions to avoid accidental interpretation of escape sequences by Python.\n\n- `(\\b\\w+)` captures a word boundary, followed by one or more word characters.\n- `(\\s+\\1\\b)+` matches one or more occurrences of whitespace followed by a repetition of the captured word.\n\nThe replacement `r'\\1'` refers to the first captured group (`(\\b\\w+)`), which is why 'there' is removed when it's repeated consecutively.\n\n### Example 3\n\n```python\nimport re\nprint(re.sub('(\\b\\w+)(\\s+\\1\\b)+', '\\1', 'hello     there      there'))\n```\n\nIn this case, the pattern is not a raw string, but it works the same way as in example 2 because the escape sequences are correctly formed. However, the replacement string is not a raw string. Here, `'\\1'` is interpreted by Python as the ASCII character with code 1 (since `\\1` is not a valid escape sequence), not as a backreference to the first group. Therefore, the substitution doesn't replace anything, and the result is the original string.\n\n### Key Takeaway\n\n- Use raw string literals (`r'...'`) in regular expressions to prevent Python from interpreting backslashes as escape sequences, unless you intend for certain escape sequences to be processed by Python.\n- In the replacement string, using raw strings ensures that backreferences (like `\\1`) are interpreted correctly by the regex engine rather than being misinterpreted by Python.\n\nIn general, using raw strings for both patterns and replacement strings in regular expressions is a good practice to avoid unexpected behavior."
