        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that the Python environment in which you're running your script does not have the `PyYAML` module installed. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify the Python Environment:**\n   - Ensure that you are using the same Python environment where `PyYAML` is installed. You can check which Python executable is being used by running:\n     ```bash\n     which python3\n     ```\n   - Ensure that you have installed `PyYAML` in the same environment. You can list installed packages using:\n     ```bash\n     pip3 list\n     ```\n\n2. **Install PyYAML in the Active Environment:**\n   - If `PyYAML` is not listed, you may need to install it in your current environment. You can do this by running:\n     ```bash\n     pip3 install PyYAML\n     ```\n\n3. **Virtual Environment:**\n   - If you are using a virtual environment, make sure it is activated before running your script. You can activate a virtual environment using:\n     ```bash\n     source /path/to/your/venv/bin/activate\n     ```\n   - After activation, ensure `PyYAML` is installed in this virtual environment:\n     ```bash\n     pip install PyYAML\n     ```\n\n4. **Check for Multiple Python Installations:**\n   - If you have multiple Python installations, there might be a mismatch in the environment where PyYAML is installed and the one being used to execute the script. Use the following to check the Python path in your script:\n     ```python\n     import sys\n     print(sys.executable)\n     ```\n\n5. **System Path and PYTHONPATH:**\n   - If you have a custom `PYTHONPATH` set, ensure it includes the path to the site-packages directory where `PyYAML` is installed.\n\n6. **Anaconda/Miniconda:**\n   - If using Anaconda or Miniconda, ensure the correct environment is activated:\n     ```bash\n     conda activate your-env-name\n     ```\n   - Install `PyYAML` using:\n     ```bash\n     conda install pyyaml\n     ```\n\nFollowing these steps should help you resolve the import error and allow you to use the `PyYAML` module in your script."
