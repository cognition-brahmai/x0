        "content": "The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) system is a method of organizing library collections by assigning a unique numerical identifier to each subject area. Developed by Melvil Dewey in 1876, it is one of the most widely used library classification systems in the world. The system is structured into ten main classes, each representing a broad area of knowledge, numbered from 000 to 999. These main classes are further divided into more specific topics through the use of decimal points, allowing for detailed categorization.\n\nHere are the ten main classes of the Dewey Decimal System:\n\n1. **000 \u2013 Generalities**: Computers, information, and general reference works.\n2. **100 \u2013 Philosophy and Psychology**: Philosophical theories, psychology, and related disciplines.\n3. **200 \u2013 Religion**: Religious beliefs, mythology, and theology.\n4. **300 \u2013 Social Sciences**: Sociology, anthropology, law, education, and related subjects.\n5. **400 \u2013 Language**: Linguistics, specific languages, and language learning.\n6. **500 \u2013 Natural Sciences and Mathematics**: Mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, earth sciences, and biology.\n7. **600 \u2013 Technology (Applied Sciences)**: Medicine, engineering, agriculture, and home economics.\n8. **700 \u2013 The Arts**: Fine arts, music, performing arts, sports, and recreation.\n9. **800 \u2013 Literature and Rhetoric**: Literature, poetry, drama, and rhetoric.\n10. **900 \u2013 Geography and History**: Geography, travel, history, and biography.\n\nThe Dewey Decimal system is designed to be hierarchical, allowing libraries to expand the categories as needed to accommodate new subjects and materials. This system helps users easily locate and access materials in a library by subject matter."
