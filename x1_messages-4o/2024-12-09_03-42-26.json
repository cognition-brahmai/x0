This template is a static string with formatting tags in it. Is there a way to interpret this string as a new f-string, avoiding the use of `.format(**locals())` call? Ideally, I would like to code in the following manner:\n\n```python\ntemplate_a = f\"The current name is {name}\"\n# OR [Ideal2] template_a = magic_fstring_function(open('template.txt').read())\nnames = [\"foo\", \"bar\"]\nfor name in names:\n    print (template_a)\n```\n\nBut I'm getting the following output:\n\n```python\nThe current name is {name}\nThe current name is {name}\n```\n\nInstead of the desired output:\n\n```python\nThe current name is foo\nThe current name is bar\n```"

        "content": "To achieve the desired behavior of using f-strings as templates without immediately evaluating them, you can store the template as a regular string and then use `eval()` to evaluate it as an f-string. This approach allows you to define the template string higher up in your code or import it from an external file and then evaluate it later with the desired variables.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\ntemplate_a = \"f'The current name is {name}'\"\n\nnames = [\"foo\", \"bar\"]\nfor name in names:\n    print(eval(template_a))\n```\n\nIn this approach, `template_a` is defined as a regular string with the content that resembles an f-string, and `eval()` is used to evaluate it, passing in the current context (which includes the variable `name`).\n\n### Important Note:\nUsing `eval()` can be risky, especially if you are evaluating strings that come from untrusted sources, as it can execute arbitrary code. It is generally recommended to avoid `eval()` unless you have full control over the input and are aware of the security implications.\n\nFor a safer alternative, you might consider using string templates from the `string` module, although it requires a slightly different syntax. Here\u2019s an example using `string.Template`:\n\n```python\nfrom string import Template\n\ntemplate_a = Template(\"The current name is $name\")\n\nnames = [\"foo\", \"bar\"]\nfor name in names:\n    print(template_a.substitute(name=name))\n```\n\nThis method avoids the use of `eval()` and provides a safer way to achieve similar functionality."
