Just as a recipe provides step-by-step instructions to create a dish, an algorithm is a set of well-defined steps or rules designed to perform a specific task or solve a problem. \n\nIn a recipe:\n- You start with a list of ingredients (input).\n- Follow a series of steps (process) to prepare the dish.\n- Finally, you end up with the completed dish (output).\n\nSimilarly, in an algorithm:\n- You begin with an initial set of data or conditions (input).\n- Execute a sequence of operations or instructions (process).\n- Conclude with a desired result or solution (output). \n\nBoth involve a clear sequence of actions to transform inputs into outputs, ensuring consistency and repeatability in the outcome."
