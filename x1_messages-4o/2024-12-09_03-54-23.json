        "content": "How can I set class attributes dynamically from variable arguments in Python? For example, I have a class with a constructor or function that takes a variable number of arguments and then sets them as class attributes conditionally. I could set them manually, but it seems that variable parameters are common enough in Python that there should be a common idiom for doing this. I have an example using eval, but that's hardly safe. I want to know the proper way to do this. Here is the initial code:\n\n```python\nclass Foo:\n    def setAllManually(self, a=None, b=None, c=None):\n        if a!=None: \n            self.a = a\n        if b!=None:\n            self.b = b\n        if c!=None:\n            self.c = c\n    def setAllWithEval(self, **kwargs):\n        for key in **kwargs:\n            if kwargs[param] != None\n                eval(\"self.\" + key + \"=\" + kwargs[param])\n```"
    },

        "content": "Setting class attributes dynamically using `eval` is indeed not safe, as it can lead to security vulnerabilities and other issues. Instead, you can achieve this using Python's built-in functions like `setattr`. Here's how you can modify your code to safely set class attributes dynamically:\n\n```python\nclass Foo:\n    def set_all_manually(self, a=None, b=None, c=None):\n        if a is not None: \n            self.a = a\n        if b is not None:\n            self.b = b\n        if c is not None:\n            self.c = c\n\n    def set_all_dynamically(self, **kwargs):\n        for key, value in kwargs.items():\n            if value is not None:\n                setattr(self, key, value)\n\n# Example usage:\nfoo = Foo()\nfoo.set_all_dynamically(a=1, b=2, c=3)\nprint(foo.__dict__)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n\nfoo.set_all_dynamically(d=4, e=5)\nprint(foo.__dict__)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4, 'e': 5}\n```\n\nIn the `set_all_dynamically` method, we use `setattr(self, key, value)` to set the attribute `key` to the value `value` on the instance `self`. This is a safe and idiomatic way to set attributes dynamically in Python. Note that we also check if the value is not `None` before setting it, similar to your initial approach."
