For instance, if I have the following data:\n\n```python\ndata = np.array([[1,1,1],[2,2,2],[3,3,3]])\nvector = np.array([1,2,3])\n```\nHow can I subtract or divide each row of `data` by the corresponding element in `vector` to achieve the following results:\n\n```python\nsub_result = [[0,0,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,0]]\ndiv_result = [[1,1,1], [1,1,1], [1,1,1]]\n```"

        "content": "To perform operations on each row of a 2D NumPy array with a corresponding 1D array, you can use broadcasting. NumPy's broadcasting allows you to perform element-wise operations without explicitly writing loops. Here's how you can achieve the subtraction and division operations:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndata = np.array([[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3]])\nvector = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n\n# Subtract each element of the vector from the corresponding row in data\nsub_result = data - vector[:, np.newaxis]\n\n# Divide each row of data by the corresponding element in the vector\ndiv_result = data / vector[:, np.newaxis]\n\nprint(\"Subtraction Result:\")\nprint(sub_result)\n\nprint(\"Division Result:\")\nprint(div_result)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `vector[:, np.newaxis]` reshapes the `vector` from shape `(3,)` to `(3, 1)`. This makes it possible to broadcast the `vector` across the rows of the `data` array.\n- The subtraction and division operations are then performed element-wise between each row of `data` and the corresponding element of `vector`.\n\nThis will give you the desired results:\n- `sub_result = [[0,0,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,0]]`\n- `div_result = [[1,1,1], [1,1,1], [1,1,1]]`"
