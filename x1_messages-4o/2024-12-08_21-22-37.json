The script should include error handling to ensure that the inputs are valid integers within a specified range. Additionally, the script should be able to handle inputs in different formats, such as hexadecimal or binary. Finally, the script should be able to output the result in multiple formats, including scientific notation and fractions. Calculate the sum of the numbers 4 and 1 in both decimal and binary formats, and display the results in a table using LaTeX markup."

It validates that the numbers are within the range of -1000 to 1000.\n- **Format Conversion:** The script can interpret decimal, binary (`0b` prefix), and hexadecimal (`0x` prefix) formats.\n- **Error Handling:** It catches exceptions related to invalid input formats and out-of-range values, prompting the user to re-enter the numbers correctly.\n- **Output Formats:** The script outputs the sum in decimal, binary, scientific notation, and as a fraction.\n- **LaTeX Table:** The script generates a LaTeX table to display the sum of the numbers 4 and 1 in both decimal and binary formats. This is hardcoded for illustrative purposes.\n\nYou can run this script in a Python environment, and it will interactively guide you through inputting numbers and displaying their sum in various formats."
