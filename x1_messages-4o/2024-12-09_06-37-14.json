However, when I try to load the model using the code `nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_lg')` I encounter an error that says: `OSError: [E050] Can't find model 'en_core_web_lg'. It doesn't seem to be a shortcut link, a Python package or a valid path to a data directory.` How can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "This issue is common when using spaCy in Google Colab due to the way environments are set up. Here's a step-by-step guide to resolve this problem:\n\n1. **Install spaCy and the Model:**\n\n   Ensure that you have installed spaCy and the specific model in the same runtime session where you plan to use them. Run the following commands:\n\n   ```python\n   !pip install -U spacy\n   !python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg\n   ```\n\n2. **Load the Model:**\n\n   After installing the model, load it using the full path. In Google Colab, you might need to specify the model's path explicitly because sometimes it doesn't automatically recognize the installed model in the environment. Use the following code:\n\n   ```python\n   import spacy\n\n   # Load the model directly from its full path\n   nlp = spacy.load(\"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/en_core_web_lg/en_core_web_lg-3.4.0\")\n   ```\n\n   Note: The path might differ based on the version and environment setup. You can check the exact path by listing the contents of the relevant directory:\n\n   ```python\n   !ls /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/en_core_web_lg\n   ```\n\n   Adjust the path based on the directory structure you see.\n\n3. **Restart the Runtime:**\n\n   If you still encounter issues, try restarting the runtime in Google Colab:\n\n   - Click on \"Runtime\" in the menu.\n   - Select \"Restart runtime\" and confirm.\n   - Rerun the installation and loading steps.\n\n4. **Check for Multiple Python Versions:**\n\n   Ensure that there aren't multiple Python versions causing conflicts. Verify the Python version you are using with:\n\n   ```python\n   !python --version\n   ```\n\n   Make sure all installations correspond to this version.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully load the `en_core_web_lg` model in your Google Colab session."
