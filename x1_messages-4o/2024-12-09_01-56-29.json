I've tried using `Response.status = 300` and `Response.status_code = 300`, but the output doesn't return the HTTP status code I set. Here's the code I'm using:\n\n```python\nfrom bottle import app, run, route, Response\n\n@route('/')\ndef f():\n    Response.status = 300 # also tried `Response.status_code = 300`\n    return dict(hello='world')\n\n'''StripPathMiddleware defined:\n   http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/recipes.html#ignore-trailing-slashes\n'''\n\nrun(host='localhost', app=StripPathMiddleware(app()))\n```\n\nWhen I run this via curl, I get the following output:\n\n```bash\n$ curl localhost:8080 -i\nHTTP/1.0 200 OK\nDate: Sun, 19 May 2013 18:28:12 GMT\nServer: WSGIServer/0.1 Python/2.7.4\nContent-Length: 18\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\"hello\": \"world\"}\n```"

        "content": "In Bottle, to set the HTTP status code for a response, you should create a new `Response` object and set its `status` attribute. However, in your current implementation, the `Response` class is being used incorrectly. You should modify your function to return a `Response` object with the desired status code.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nfrom bottle import app, run, route, Response\n\n@route('/')\ndef f():\n    body = dict(hello='world')\n    response = Response(body=body, status=300)\n    return response\n\n# Assuming StripPathMiddleware is defined elsewhere in your code\n\nrun(host='localhost', app=StripPathMiddleware(app()))\n```\n\nWith this change, when you run the server and make a request using `curl`, you should see the HTTP status code 300 in the response. By explicitly returning a `Response` object with the `status` set to your desired code, you ensure that the status code is correctly set in the HTTP response."
