I want to use it to search on Google and get the first 3-5 results from a Google search, rather than searching on a personal site or something similar. I already have a Developer Key, but I need to understand how to get a `cx` ID for searching on Google."

        "content": "To use the Google Custom Search API for searching the web, you need to set up a Custom Search Engine (CSE) that searches the entire web, and then use the `cx` ID associated with that search engine. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to obtaining a `cx` ID:\n\n1. **Create a Custom Search Engine:**\n   - Go to the [Google Custom Search Engine](https://cse.google.com/cse/all) page.\n   - Click on \"Add\" to create a new search engine.\n\n2. **Configure the Search Engine:**\n   - In the \"Sites to search\" box, enter `www.google.com`.\n   - Give your search engine a name.\n   - Click \"Create\" to create the search engine.\n\n3. **Edit the Search Engine:**\n   - Once the search engine is created, click on \"Control Panel\" next to your newly created search engine.\n   - Under the \"Basics\" tab, find the \"Sites to search\" section and change the setting to \"Search the entire web but emphasize included sites.\"\n\n4. **Get the `cx` ID:**\n   - In the Control Panel, the `cx` ID (Search Engine ID) can be found in the \"Details\" section.\n   - It will be listed as \"Search engine ID\". Copy this ID.\n\n5. **Use the `cx` ID in Your Python Code:**\n   - You can now use this `cx` ID along with your Developer Key to make requests to the Custom Search JSON API.\n\nHere's a basic example in Python to get the first 3-5 results from a search query:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef google_search(query, api_key, cx_id):\n    search_url = \"https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1\"\n    params = {\n        \"key\": api_key,\n        \"cx\": cx_id,\n        \"q\": query,\n        \"num\": 3  # Number of results to return\n    }\n\n    response = requests.get(search_url, params=params)\n    results = response.json().get('items', [])\n\n    for i, item in enumerate(results, start=1):\n        print(f\"Result {i}:\")\n        print(f\"Title: {item.get('title')}\")\n        print(f\"Link: {item.get('link')}\\n\")\n\n# Replace 'your_api_key' and 'your_cx_id' with your actual API key and cx ID\napi_key = 'your_api_key'\ncx_id = 'your_cx_id'\nquery = 'your search query'\n\ngoogle_search(query, api_key, cx_id)\n```\n\nMake sure you have the necessary API access enabled in your Google Cloud Console for the Custom Search API."
