You want to write a Python function that takes in this dataset and returns the average release year of all the movies. \nCan you explain the syntax for defining such a function in Python, including the necessary input parameter(s) and return statement? Please provide an example of how you would call this function using a sample movie dataset."

        "content": "Certainly! In Python, you can define a function using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses with any parameters, and a colon. Inside the function, you can perform operations and use the `return` statement to return a value.\n\nTo calculate the average release year of movies from a dataset, the function might look something like this:\n\n```python\ndef average_release_year(movies):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the average release year of a list of movies.\n\n    Parameters:\n    movies (list of dict): A list where each element is a dictionary\n                           containing 'title', 'director', and 'release_year'.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The average release year of the movies.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not movies:\n        return 0  # Return 0 if the list is empty\n\n    total_years = 0\n    for movie in movies:\n        total_years += movie['release_year']\n\n    average_year = total_years / len(movies)\n    return average_year\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Function Name**: `average_release_year`\n- **Parameter**: `movies`, which is expected to be a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary should have at least the key `'release_year'`.\n- **Return**: The function returns the average release year as a floating-point number.\n\n### Example Usage:\n\nHere's how you can call this function with a sample movie dataset:\n\n```python\n# Sample movie dataset\nmovie_dataset = [\n    {'title': 'Movie A', 'director': 'Director X', 'release_year': 2000},\n    {'title': 'Movie B', 'director': 'Director Y', 'release_year': 2005},\n    {'title': 'Movie C', 'director': 'Director Z', 'release_year': 2010}\n]\n\n# Calculate average release year\naverage_year = average_release_year(movie_dataset)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"The average release year of the movies is: {average_year:.2f}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Example:\n\n- The `movie_dataset` is a list of dictionaries, each representing a movie with a `title`, `director`, and `release_year`.\n- The function `average_release_year` is called with `movie_dataset` as the argument.\n- The function calculates the average release year and returns it.\n- The result is printed with two decimal places for better readability.\n\nThis is a simple implementation, and you can enhance it by adding error handling or supporting more complex data structures if needed."
