I have tried using the following code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv('https://query.data.world/s/Hfu_PsEuD1Z_yJHmGaxWTxvkz7W_b0')\npercent= 100*(len(df.loc[:,df.isnull().sum(axis=0)>=1 ].index) / len(df.index))\nprint(round(percent,2))\n```\n\nBut it doesn't give me the desired output. I want the output to be in this format:\n\n```python\nOrd_id                 0.00\nProd_id                0.00\nShip_id                0.00\nCust_id                0.00\nSales                  0.24\nDiscount               0.65\nOrder_Quantity         0.65\nProfit                 0.65\nShipping_Cost          0.65\nProduct_Base_Margin    1.30\ndtype: float64\n```"

        "content": "To calculate the percentage of missing values in each column of a dataset using pandas, you can use the following approach. Your current code doesn't compute the percentage of missing values for each column individually. Instead, it calculates a single percentage for columns with at least one missing value, which is not what you're looking for.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to get the desired output:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the dataset\ndf = pd.read_csv('https://query.data.world/s/Hfu_PsEuD1Z_yJHmGaxWTxvkz7W_b0')\n\n# Calculate the percentage of missing values in each column\npercent_missing = df.isnull().mean() * 100\n\n# Round the percentages to 2 decimal places\npercent_missing_rounded = round(percent_missing, 2)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(percent_missing_rounded)\n```\n\nThis script calculates the percentage of missing values for each column by taking the mean of the boolean DataFrame returned by `isnull()`, which gives the proportion of missing values in each column. Multiplying by 100 converts the proportion to a percentage, and rounding to two decimal places formats the output as desired."
