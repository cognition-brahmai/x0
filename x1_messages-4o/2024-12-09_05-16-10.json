        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The error you're encountering, `TypeError: must be type, not classobj`, typically arises in Python 2 when there's a mix of old-style and new-style classes. In Python 2, classes that don't explicitly inherit from `object` are old-style, whereas classes that do inherit from `object` are new-style.\n\nThe confusion here seems to stem from the use of `HTMLParser`, which should indeed be a new-style class because it inherits from `object`. However, it appears you might be using the `HTMLParser` from Python\u2019s standard library that may not be correctly imported or mixed up with a different version or implementation.\n\nHere are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Correct Import**: Double-check that you are importing `HTMLParser` from the correct module. In Python 2, the module is `HTMLParser`. In Python 3, it is `html.parser`.\n\n    ```python\n    from HTMLParser import HTMLParser  # Python 2\n    # or\n    from html.parser import HTMLParser  # Python 3\n    ```\n\n2. **Python Version**: If you are using Python 2, consider upgrading to Python 3 if possible, as Python 2 is no longer supported. Python 3 uses new-style classes by default, which resolves many of these issues.\n\n3. **Use `super()` in Python 3**: If you are indeed using Python 3 and still encounter issues, verify the import statement. In Python 3, you can use `super()` without arguments for simplicity:\n\n    ```python\n    class TextParser(HTMLParser):\n        def __init__(self):\n            super().__init__()\n            self.all_data = []\n    ```\n\n4. **Mixing Classes**: Ensure that no part of your code or libraries being used are mixing old-style and new-style class definitions, as this can lead to the error you're seeing.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `TypeError` and correctly use `super()` in your class. If you are constrained to using Python 2, using `HTMLParser.__init__(self)` as a workaround is indeed valid, though upgrading to Python 3 is recommended for better support and features."
