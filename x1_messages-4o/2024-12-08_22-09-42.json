The game was later introduced to Japan and became known as \"jan-ken.\" The Japanese version uses the same hand-gestures but the words for the gestures are different.</p>\n\n    <div class=\"hand-gestures\">\n        <div>\n            <img src=\"https://example.com/rock.png\" alt=\"Rock Gesture\">\n            <p><strong>Rock</strong></p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <img src=\"https://example.com/paper.png\" alt=\"Paper Gesture\">\n            <p><strong>Paper</strong></p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <img src=\"https://example.com/scissors.png\" alt=\"Scissors Gesture\">\n            <p><strong>Scissors</strong></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <h2>Spread to the West</h2>\n    <p>The game spread to the West during the early 20th century and became known as \"Rock, Paper, Scissors.\" It quickly gained popularity due to its simple rules and the fact that it requires no equipment, making it accessible to people of all ages and cultures.</p>\n\n    <h2>Modern Usage</h2>\n    <p>Today, Rock, Paper, Scissors is played worldwide and is often used in decision-making scenarios.
