While the code I've written solves the problem correctly, it doesn't pass the submission process or the unit test because I have hard coded the theta values and didn't allow for more than two theta values. Here is the code I have so far:\n\n```octave\nfunction J = computeCost(X, y, theta)\nm = length(y);\nJ = 0;\nfor i = 1:m,\n    h = theta(1) + theta(2) * X(i)\n    a = h - y(i);\n    b = a^2;\n    J = J + b;\n    end;\nJ = J * (1 / (2 * m));\nend\n```\n\nThe unit test is:\n\n```octave\ncomputeCost( [1 2 3; 1 3 4; 1 4 5; 1 5 6], [7;6;5;4], [0.1;0.2;0.3])\n```\n\nWhich should produce ans = 7.0175, but I am stuck on where and how to add another loop to iterate over theta to allow for any number of theta values. Can anyone suggest a solution?"

        "content": "To generalize your `computeCost` function to handle any number of features (which corresponds to the number of theta values), you need to modify the computation of the hypothesis \\( h \\) to use matrix-vector multiplication. This will automatically handle any number of features without hardcoding the theta values. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```octave\nfunction J = computeCost(X, y, theta)\n    m = length(y); % number of training examples\n    J = 0;\n    \n    % Compute hypothesis vector for all training examples\n    h = X * theta;\n    \n    % Calculate the squared errors\n    squaredErrors = (h - y) .^ 2;\n    \n    % Compute the cost\n    J = (1 / (2 * m)) * sum(squaredErrors);\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Matrix-Vector Multiplication**: The line `h = X * theta;` computes the hypothesis for all training examples in one go by performing matrix-vector multiplication. `X` is a matrix where each row represents a training example, and `theta` is a column vector of parameters. This multiplication gives you a column vector `h` where each element is the hypothesis for the corresponding training example.\n\n2. **Element-wise Squaring**: `(h - y) .^ 2` computes the element-wise square of the differences between the predicted and actual values.\n\n3. **Sum and Scale**: `sum(squaredErrors)` sums up all the squared errors, and then it is scaled by `(1 / (2 * m))` to compute the cost function.\n\nThis approach is efficient and easily scales to any number of features. Try running this updated code with your unit test, and it should produce the expected result."
