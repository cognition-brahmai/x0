I've tried using `request.POST['data']`, `request.raw_post_data`, and `request.body`, but none of these options seem to be working for me. I'm posting JSON data using the `requests` module in Python. How can I successfully collect posted data in Django 1.6? Here's the code I'm using:\n\nViews.py:\n```python\nimport json\nfrom django.http import StreamingHttpResponse\n\ndef main_page(request):\n    if request.method=='POST':\n            received_json_data=json.loads(request.POST['data'])\n            #received_json_data=json.loads(request.body)\n            return StreamingHttpResponse('it was post request: '+str(received_json_data))\n    return StreamingHttpResponse('it was GET request')\n```\n\nRequests:\n```python\nimport requests  \nimport json\nurl = \"http://localhost:8000\"\ndata = {'data':[{'key1':'val1'}, {'key2':'val2'}]}\nheaders = {'content-type': 'application/json'}\nr=requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(data), headers=headers)\nr.text\n```"

        "content": "When working with JSON data in Django, especially with older versions like Django 1.6, you need to ensure you're correctly handling the data being sent in the request. The key point is that when you're sending JSON data, it's in the request body and not in `request.POST`. Here's how you can handle it:\n\n### Adjusting Your `views.py`\n\nIn your view, you should be using `request.body` to read the raw request data, especially since you're sending JSON. Here's how you can modify your `views.py`:\n\n```python\nimport json\nfrom django.http import StreamingHttpResponse\n\ndef main_page(request):\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        try:\n            # Use request.body to read the raw POST data\n            received_json_data = json.loads(request.body.decode('utf-8'))\n            return StreamingHttpResponse('It was a POST request: ' + str(received_json_data))\n        except json.JSONDecodeError:\n            return StreamingHttpResponse('Invalid JSON data received', status=400)\n    return StreamingHttpResponse('It was a GET request')\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **`request.body`**: This is the correct way to access the raw body of the request in Django when you're dealing with JSON data. The data is in bytes, so you need to decode it using UTF-8 before converting it to JSON.\n\n- **Error Handling**: It's always a good idea to include error handling (using `try` and `except`) for JSON decoding to provide clear feedback when invalid JSON is received.\n\n### Sending JSON with `requests`\n\nYour code for sending the request using the `requests` library is mostly correct, but ensure that you're using the correct method to send JSON. You're already setting the `Content-Type` header correctly, but you can simplify it by using the `json` parameter provided by `requests.post`:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\n\nurl = \"http://localhost:8000\"\ndata = {'data': [{'key1': 'val1'}, {'key2': 'val2'}]}\n\n# Use the json parameter to automatically set the content type and serialize the data\nr = requests.post(url, json=data)\nprint(r.text)\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy using `request.body` and decoding it properly, you should be able to handle JSON data in your Django application correctly. The `requests.post` method with the `json` parameter simplifies sending JSON data, making your code cleaner and less error-prone."
