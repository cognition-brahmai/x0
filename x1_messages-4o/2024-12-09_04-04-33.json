Is it possible to use commands such as `find *.txt -exec echo \"$(tail -1 '{}'),$(ls '{}')\" \\;`?

        "content": "The `find -exec` command is powerful, but using it with multiple commands requires a bit of a workaround because the `-exec` option only executes a single command. However, you can achieve what you're looking for by using a shell to combine multiple commands. Here\u2019s how you can modify your command to achieve the desired result:\n\n```bash\nfind . -name \"*.txt\" -exec sh -c 'for file do echo \"$(tail -n 1 \"$file\"),$file\"; done' sh {} +\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of how this works:\n\n1. **`find . -name \"*.txt\"`**: This part finds all files with a `.txt` extension in the current directory and its subdirectories.\n\n2. **`-exec sh -c '...' sh {}`**: This part uses `sh -c` to execute a shell command. The `{}` is replaced by the current file found by `find`.\n\n3. **`for file do ... done`**: This loop iterates over each file passed to the shell.\n\n4. **`echo \"$(tail -n 1 \"$file\"),$file\"`**: This command gets the last line of the file using `tail -n 1` and appends the filename, separated by a comma.\n\n5. **`+`**: This allows `find` to pass multiple file names to the shell command in a single execution, which is more efficient than executing the command separately for each file.\n\nBy using this command, you should be able to print the last line of each `.txt` file in the current directory, followed by a comma and the filename."
