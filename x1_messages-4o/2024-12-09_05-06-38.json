I have a simple string with no line breaks, not a file. For instance, if I have a string like this: \n\n`part 1;\"this is ; part 2;\";'this is ; part 3';part 4;this \"is ; part\" 5`\n\nI would like to split it into the following parts:\n\n- part 1\n- \"this is ; part 2;\"\n- 'this is ; part 3'\n- part 4\n- this \"is ; part\" 5\n\nI think this can be accomplished with a regex, but I'm open to other methods as well if regex isn't the solution."

        "content": "To split a string based on semicolons while ignoring those inside quoted strings, you can use a regular expression with Python's `re` module. The idea is to split the string on semicolons that are not within quotes. Here's an approach using regex with a negative lookbehind to accomplish this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef split_ignoring_quoted_semicolons(s):\n    # Regular expression to match semicolons not within quotes\n    pattern = r'''\n        (?:            # Non-capturing group\n            '          # Match opening single quote\n            [^']*      # Match anything that's not a single quote\n            '          # Match closing single quote\n            |          # OR\n            \"          # Match opening double quote\n            [^\"]*      # Match anything that's not a double quote\n            \"          # Match closing double quote\n            |          # OR\n            [^;'\"]+    # Match anything that's not a semicolon or quote\n        )              # End of non-capturing group\n    '''\n    # Find all matches using the regex pattern\n    parts = re.findall(pattern, s, re.VERBOSE)\n    return [part.strip() for part in parts]\n\n# Example usage\nstring = 'part 1;\"this is ; part 2;\";\\'this is ; part 3\\';part 4;this \"is ; part\" 5'\nresult = split_ignoring_quoted_semicolons(string)\n\nfor i, part in enumerate(result, start=1):\n    print(f'Part {i}: {part}')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The pattern uses non-capturing groups `(?: ...)` to match different parts of the string.\n- It matches single-quoted strings, double-quoted strings, or any sequence of characters that are not semicolons, single quotes, or double quotes.\n- The `re.VERBOSE` flag allows for more readable regex by enabling the use of whitespace and comments.\n- `re.findall` returns all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string, effectively splitting the string by semicolons outside of quotes.\n\nThis approach should correctly split the string as desired, respecting the quoted sections."
