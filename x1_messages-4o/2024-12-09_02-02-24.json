        "content": "In Java, you cannot directly call a method like `var.isPrimitive()` on a variable to check if it's of a primitive type. Instead, you can use reflection to check if a class represents a primitive type. However, at runtime, you typically do not have a direct reference to a primitive type's class since variables of primitive types are not objects in Java. \n\nHere's an approach to determine if a variable's type is primitive:\n\n1. **Using Reflection**: If you have a `Class` object, you can use the `isPrimitive()` method to check if it represents a primitive type.\n\n2. **Handling Variables**: If you're dealing with variables and want to check if their type is primitive, you generally would do this through the class of the variable.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use reflection to check if a type is primitive:\n\n```java\npublic class PrimitiveCheck {\n    \n    public static boolean isPrimitiveType(Class<?> clazz) {\n        return clazz.isPrimitive();\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int intVar = 10;\n        Integer integerVar = 10;\n        \n        System.out.println(\"intVar is primitive: \" + isPrimitiveType(int.class)); // true\n        System.out.println(\"integerVar is primitive: \" + isPrimitiveType(Integer.class)); // false\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we check if `int.class` is a primitive type, which it is. On the other hand, `Integer.class` is not a primitive type, so `isPrimitiveType(Integer.class)` returns false.\n\nIf you want to check the type of a variable dynamically and you're not using reflection, you typically need to know the type at compile time, as Java is statically typed. For runtime checks, reflection or similar mechanisms would be necessary."
