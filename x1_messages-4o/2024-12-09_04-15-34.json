I'm currently using the datetime module and have the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ntstart = datetime.now()\nprint t1\n\n# code to speed test\n\ntend = datetime.now()\nprint t2\n```\n\nHowever, I'm not sure how to calculate and print the time difference between 'tstart' and 'tend'. I've attempted to read the API docs, but I'm having trouble understanding the 'timedelta' concept. Can someone guide me through how to properly calculate this time difference?"

        "content": "Certainly! In Python, the `datetime` module provides a convenient way to work with dates and times, and the `timedelta` object is used to represent the difference between two dates or times. To calculate the time difference between `tstart` and `tend`, you simply subtract one from the other, which will give you a `timedelta` object. You can then access various attributes of this object to get the difference in seconds, microseconds, etc.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to calculate and print the time difference:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ntstart = datetime.now()\n\n# code to speed test\n\ntend = datetime.now()\n\n# Calculate the time difference\ntime_difference = tend - tstart\n\n# Print the time difference in the format you want\nprint(\"Time taken: {} seconds\".format(time_difference.total_seconds()))\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- By subtracting `tstart` from `tend`, you get a `timedelta` object stored in `time_difference`.\n- The `total_seconds()` method of the `timedelta` object returns the total duration expressed in seconds as a float, which includes the fractional part (microseconds).\n- You can also access attributes like `days`, `seconds`, and `microseconds` if you need more granular control over how the time difference is displayed.\n\nThis should give you a clear idea of how long your code section takes to execute."
