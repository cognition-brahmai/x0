I have tried using the 'os' and 're' modules and the 'os.listdir' function, but my current code is returning all files. How can I modify it so it only returns \".c\" files?\n\nHere's the code I have so far:\n```python\nimport os\nimport re\n\nresults = []\n\nfor folder in gamefolders:\n    for f in os.listdir(folder):\n        if re.search('.c', f):\n            results += [f]\n\nprint results\n```"

        "content": "To find all files with a specific extension, such as \".c\" files, you need to ensure that your regular expression correctly matches only files that end with \".c\". The regular expression `'.c'` will match any file containing \".c\" anywhere in its name, which is why you're getting more files than expected. You should use `'.*\\.c$'` to match files that end with \".c\". However, a simpler approach is to use string methods to check the file extension.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code using string methods to achieve the desired results:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nresults = []\n\n# Assuming 'gamefolders' is a list of directories you want to search\ngamefolders = ['/path/to/directory1', '/path/to/directory2']\n\nfor folder in gamefolders:\n    for f in os.listdir(folder):\n        if f.endswith('.c'):\n            results.append(f)\n\nprint(results)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`f.endswith('.c')`**: This checks if the filename ends with \".c\".\n- **`results.append(f)`**: This adds the file to the results list if it matches the condition.\n\nThis code will accurately return a list of files with the \".c\" extension from the specified directories. Make sure to replace `'/path/to/directory1'` and `'/path/to/directory2'` with the actual paths of the directories you want to search."
