However, my model is only about 50% accurate which is equivalent to random guessing. I used this code from a tutorial (https://machinelearningmastery.com/tutorial-first-neural-network-python-keras/) and modified it to fit my needs. Despite this, I am still facing issues with the model's accuracy. Can anyone provide a solution to enhance the accuracy of my model?\n\nThe code I used is as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense\nimport numpy\n# fix random seed for reproducibility\nseed = 7\nnumpy.random.seed(seed)\n\nX = list(range(1000))\nY = [1,0]*500\n# create model\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(Dense(12, input_dim=1, init='uniform', activation='relu'))\nmodel.add(Dense(8, init='uniform', activation='relu'))\nmodel.add(Dense(1, init='uniform', activation='sigmoid'))\n# Compile model\nmodel.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])\n# Fit the model\nmodel.fit(X, Y, epochs=150, batch_size=10,  verbose=2)\n# calculate predictions\npredictions = model.predict(X)\n# round predictions\nrounded = [round(x[0])for x in predictions]\nprint(rounded)\n```"

        "content": "The task of predicting whether a number is even or odd is a classic problem that is inherently deterministic, meaning it can be solved with a simple mathematical operation without the need for a machine learning model. However, if you would like to pursue this as a learning exercise in machine learning, let's go through some suggestions to improve your model's accuracy:\n\n1. **Data Representation**: \n   - You are using a range of numbers as input features, but you only have a single feature (the number itself). Consider using additional features or transformations that might help the model learn better. For example, one hot encoding of the least significant bit (which determines if a number is odd or even) could be helpful.\n\n2. **Model Complexity**: \n   - Your model might be too simple for learning even simple deterministic tasks. Try adding more layers or neurons, but be cautious about overfitting.\n\n3. **Activation Functions**:\n   - Examine the choice of activation functions. While `relu` followed by `sigmoid` is a common choice, for binary classification, you might want to ensure proper scaling of inputs and outputs.\n\n4. **Loss Function**:\n   - Use `binary_crossentropy` instead of `mean_squared_error` for binary classification tasks. This is more suitable and will likely provide better results.\n\n5. **Initialization**:\n   - The parameter `init='uniform'` is deprecated. Use `kernel_initializer='uniform'`.\n\n6. **Data Normalization**:\n   - Normalize your input data to be within a certain range (e.g., 0 to 1) to help the model learn better.\n\n7. **Evaluation**:\n   - Ensure that your evaluation metric aligns with the problem. Since this is a binary classification problem, use accuracy and confusion matrix to evaluate performance.\n\nHere's a revised version of your code with some of these suggestions incorporated:\n\n```python\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\n\n# Fix random seed for reproducibility\nseed = 7\nnp.random.seed(seed)\n\n# Generate data\nX = np.array(list(range(1000)))\nY = np.array([1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0 for x in X])\n\n# Normalize data\nscaler = MinMaxScaler()\nX = scaler.fit_transform(X.reshape(-1, 1))\n\n# Create model\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(Dense(12, input_dim=1, kernel_initializer='uniform', activation='relu'))\nmodel.add(Dense(8, kernel_initializer='uniform', activation='relu'))\nmodel.add(Dense(1, kernel_initializer='uniform', activation='sigmoid'))\n\n# Compile model\nmodel.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Fit the model\nmodel.fit(X, Y, epochs=150, batch_size=10, verbose=2)\n\n# Calculate predictions\npredictions = model.predict(X)\nrounded = [round(x[0]) for x in predictions]\nprint(rounded)\n```\n\nBy implementing these changes, your model should perform better, but remember that for such a deterministic task, a simple modulus operation is the most efficient solution."
