I am required to use Kaggle's data for training and submission, so I can't use torchvision.datasets.mnist. Following a tutorial, I am trying to create a Dataset object that loads .pt tensors from files to fully utilize my GPU. To do this, I load the csv data provided by Kaggle and save it as .pt files using Pytorch's tensor.save() function. However, despite each 'train_tensor[i].shape' being 'torch.Size([1, 784]', each .pt file ends up being around 130MB. This is strange because a tensor of the same size, with randomly generated integers, only has a size of 6.6kB. Why are these tensors so large and how can I reduce their size? My dataset has 42,000 samples, should I consider batching this data? Should I save tensors to separate files, rather than loading them all into RAM and then slicing into batches? What would be the most optimal approach?"

        "content": "It sounds like you're encountering an issue related to the storage format of the tensors when saving them as `.pt` files. Here are a few things you might consider to address the size issue and optimize your workflow:\n\n1. **Data Type and Storage Format:**\n   - Check the data type of your tensors before saving them. By default, PyTorch tensors are often saved as float32, which is more space-consuming compared to int or uint8. If your data is integer-based (e.g., pixel values from 0 to 255), consider converting your tensors to a lower precision format like `torch.uint8` before saving:\n     ```python\n     train_tensor = train_tensor.to(torch.uint8)\n     ```\n\n2. **Compression:**\n   - Consider using compression techniques when saving your tensors. The `torch.save()` function allows for saving with compression using pickle\u2019s protocol. You can specify the protocol using the `pickle_protocol` argument:\n     ```python\n     torch.save(train_tensor, 'filename.pt', pickle_protocol=4)\n     ```\n\n3. **Batching Data:**\n   - Given the size of your dataset, batching can be very helpful. Instead of saving each sample as an individual file, you might consider batching your data into smaller tensors and saving those. This can reduce the overhead of file management and make loading more efficient:\n     ```python\n     batch_size = 1000\n     for i in range(0, len(train_tensor), batch_size):\n         batch = train_tensor[i:i + batch_size]\n         torch.save(batch, f'batch_{i // batch_size}.pt')\n     ```\n\n4. **Memory Management:**\n   - If memory usage is a concern, do not load all samples into memory at once. Instead, you can use a custom dataset class that loads each batch or sample on-the-fly. This is especially useful if you're working with large datasets:\n     ```python\n     import torch\n     from torch.utils.data import Dataset\n\n     class MNISTDataset(Dataset):\n         def __init__(self, file_list):\n             self.file_list = file_list\n\n         def __len__(self):\n             return len(self.file_list)\n\n         def __getitem__(self, idx):\n             data = torch.load(self.file_list[idx])\n             return data\n\n     # Example usage:\n     file_list = ['batch_0.pt', 'batch_1.pt', ...]\n     dataset = MNISTDataset(file_list)\n     ```\n\n5. **Data Loader with Transformation:**\n   - When using a `DataLoader`, you can apply transformations on-the-fly to manage memory better and prepare your data for training efficiently.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you should be able to manage the size of your `.pt` files more effectively and optimize the loading and training processes on your GPU."
