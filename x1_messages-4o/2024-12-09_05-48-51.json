Being a novice at implementing a parser, I need advice on how to best implement a SQL parser and evaluator. Does the approach described above sound right? Are there other tools/libraries I should consider like PLY or Pyparsing? Any pointers to articles, books or source code that will help me is appreciated. I have also implemented a simple SQL parser using pyparsing combined with Python code that implements the relational operations against my data store. As the intent of the exercise is to make the data available to reporting engines, I am considering implementing an ODBC driver but understand that it is a lot of work. Any guidance would be appreciated."

        "content": "Creating a SQL interface on top of a non-relational data store is an ambitious project, and using ANTLR to produce an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is a solid approach. Here's a breakdown of your plan and additional guidance:\n\n### 1. Using ANTLR\n\n- **ANTLR**: ANTLR (Another Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful tool for building language parsers. It can generate parsers for a variety of languages, including SQL. ANTLR is well-suited for your needs as it can generate an AST that you can then transform into relational algebra expressions.\n\n- **Getting Started with ANTLR**:\n  - **Grammar Definition**: Define the SQL grammar that your parser will understand. ANTLR provides a high-level grammar syntax that makes this task easier.\n  - **Generate Parser and Lexer**: Use ANTLR to generate the parser and lexer for your defined grammar.\n  - **AST Traversal**: Once you have an AST, you can traverse it to evaluate SQL queries against your non-relational data store.\n\n- **Resources**:\n  - \"The Definitive ANTLR 4 Reference\" by Terence Parr is an excellent book to guide you through ANTLR.\n  - Online tutorials and the ANTLR documentation are also very helpful.\n\n### 2. Alternative Tools\n\n- **PLY (Python Lex-Yacc)**: PLY is a Python implementation of the classic Lex and Yacc tools. It is simpler than ANTLR and could be a good choice if you're comfortable with Python and looking for a lightweight solution.\n\n- **Pyparsing**: You mentioned you've already used Pyparsing. It's a good tool for building simple parsers in Python, although it might be less powerful than ANTLR for complex grammars.\n\n### 3. Implementing the Evaluator\n\n- **Relational Algebra Representation**: Once you have an AST, map it to relational algebra operations. This involves defining operations like selection, projection, join, etc., which you will need to implement or simulate on your non-relational store.\n\n- **Execution Engine**: Develop an execution engine that can take these relational algebra expressions and execute them against your data store. This might involve translating operations into API calls or queries that your non-relational store understands.\n\n### 4. ODBC Driver\n\n- **ODBC Implementation**: Writing an ODBC driver is indeed a significant undertaking. It involves understanding the ODBC API and implementing the necessary functions to handle connections, execute queries, and fetch results.\n\n- **Consider Alternatives**: Before committing to ODBC, evaluate if a simpler custom API or a RESTful service might meet your needs with less complexity.\n\n### 5. Further Resources\n\n- **Books**: \"SQL and Relational Theory\" by C.J. Date is a good resource for understanding the principles of relational algebra.\n\n- **Online Articles and Tutorials**: Look for resources on implementing SQL parsers or relational algebra interpreters, as well as community forums where similar projects might be discussed.\n\n- **Open Source Projects**: Explore existing open-source projects for inspiration. Projects like Apache Calcite might provide insights into how SQL parsers and execution engines are implemented.\n\nBy leveraging these tools and resources, you can build a robust SQL interface on top of your non-relational data store. Remember, this is a complex task, so take it step by step, and don't hesitate to seek help from communities and forums."
