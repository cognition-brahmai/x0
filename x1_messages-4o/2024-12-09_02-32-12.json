        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that the `dnspython` module isn't being recognized by your environment, even though you've installed it. This is a common issue that can occur due to several reasons. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Installation:**\n   - Ensure `dnspython` is installed in the same environment where your script is running. You can verify this by running:\n     ```shell\n     pip show dnspython\n     ```\n   - If it's not installed, you can install it using:\n     ```shell\n     pip install dnspython\n     ```\n\n2. **Version Compatibility:**\n   - You mentioned you're using `pymongo` version 3.6.1. Consider updating `pymongo` to a more recent version, as newer versions might have better support for SRV records and dependencies:\n     ```shell\n     pip install --upgrade pymongo\n     ```\n\n3. **Virtual Environment:**\n   - If you're using a virtual environment, ensure it's activated when you install `dnspython`. If not, activate it and reinstall:\n     ```shell\n     source <your-venv>/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux\n     <your-venv>\\Scripts\\activate      # On Windows\n     pip install dnspython\n     ```\n\n4. **Python Path:**\n   - Ensure your script is running with the same Python interpreter where `dnspython` is installed. You can check the Python path by running:\n     ```python\n     import sys\n     print(sys.executable)\n     ```\n\n5. **Restart Your Environment:**\n   - Sometimes, a simple restart of your IDE or terminal can help in recognizing newly installed packages.\n\n6. **Manual Import Check:**\n   - To confirm that `dnspython` can be imported, try running the following in a Python shell:\n     ```python\n     import dns\n     ```\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, please check for any environment-specific problems or consider creating a new virtual environment to ensure a clean setup."
