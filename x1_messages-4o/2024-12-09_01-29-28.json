        "content": "The error you're encountering indicates that the NVCC (NVIDIA CUDA Compiler) does not support the GPU architecture 'compute_11'. This architecture corresponds to the very early CUDA-capable GPUs, and support for these older architectures is often dropped in newer versions of CUDA.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Update CUDA_ARCH_BIN**: Modify your `CUDA_ARCH_BIN` to remove unsupported architectures. You should specify only the architectures supported by your version of CUDA. For example, if you're using CUDA 6.5 or 7.0, you might set it to:\n\n   ```\n   CUDA_ARCH_BIN=2.0 2.1(2.0) 3.0 3.5 5.0 5.2\n   ```\n\n   This assumes you're targeting more recent GPU architectures (e.g., compute capability 2.0 and above). Adjust this based on the actual GPUs you intend to support.\n\n2. **Remove Unsupported Architectures in CMake**: Within your CMake configuration, ensure that `CUDA_ARCH_BIN` only includes supported architectures. You can specify this using the `-D` flag when configuring with CMake:\n\n   ```sh\n   cmake -D CUDA_ARCH_BIN=\"2.0 2.1 3.0 3.5 5.0 5.2\" ...\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify CUDA and OpenCV Compatibility**: Ensure that the versions of OpenCV and CUDA you are using are compatible. Sometimes, newer versions of OpenCV drop support for older CUDA versions, or vice versa.\n\n4. **Reconfigure and Rebuild**: After adjusting the `CUDA_ARCH_BIN`, re-run CMake to configure the build system, and then rebuild your Visual Studio solution.\n\n5. **Check for Deprecation Warnings**: Always check the CUDA release notes for any deprecation or removal of support for older GPU architectures.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the error and build OpenCV with CUDA support for the architectures supported by your CUDA and hardware."
