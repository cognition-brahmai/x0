The `collections.deque` object can be checked for emptiness using its inherent truth value, similar to how you would check for an empty list.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Create a deque\nd = deque()\n\n# Check if the deque is empty\nif not d:\n    print(\"The deque is empty.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The deque is not empty.\")\n```\n\nIn this example, `not d` evaluates to `True` if the deque `d` is empty, and `False` if it contains one or more elements. This is a straightforward and Pythonic way to check for an empty deque without needing to handle exceptions."
