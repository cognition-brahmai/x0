I've tried the following script, but it's not producing the desired output. In instances where there is no dependent label present in the 'predicted' column and the class which is present in the 'test data', it's not showing up in the output. Is there another way to achieve this? Here's the code I've been using:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nexpected = y_test\ny_actu = pd.Series(expected, name='Actual')\ny_pred = pd.Series(predicted, name='Predicted')\ndf_confusion = pd.crosstab(y_actu, y_pred,y_test.unique())\n\ndf_confusion\n\ndf_confusion.to_csv('SVM_Confusion_Matrix.csv')\n\nfrom pandas import ExcelWriter\nwriter = ExcelWriter('SVM_Confusion_Matrix.xlsx')\ndf_confusion.to_excel(writer,'Sheet1')\nwriter.save()\n```"

        "content": "To ensure that all classes from the test data appear in your confusion matrix, even if some classes are not present in the predictions, you can specify the `rownames` and `colnames` parameters in the `pd.crosstab()` function to include all possible classes explicitly. This will prevent the omission of any class that is present in the test data but not in the predictions. Here's how you can modify your script:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\n\n# Assuming y_test and predicted are your actual and predicted labels\nexpected = y_test\ny_actu = pd.Series(expected, name='Actual')\ny_pred = pd.Series(predicted, name='Predicted')\n\n# Get unique class labels from both true and predicted labels\nclass_labels = sorted(set(y_test) | set(predicted))\n\n# Create confusion matrix with all class labels\ndf_confusion = pd.crosstab(y_actu, y_pred, rownames=['Actual'], colnames=['Predicted'], dropna=False)\ndf_confusion = df_confusion.reindex(index=class_labels, columns=class_labels, fill_value=0)\n\n# Export to CSV\ndf_confusion.to_csv('SVM_Confusion_Matrix.csv')\n\n# Export to Excel\nwith pd.ExcelWriter('SVM_Confusion_Matrix.xlsx') as writer:\n    df_confusion.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Sheet1')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Set Operations**: `set(y_test) | set(predicted)` ensures that all unique classes from both the actual and predicted labels are included.\n- **Reindexing**: `reindex()` is used to fill in any missing class labels in the confusion matrix, using `fill_value=0` to handle any missing labels.\n- **Export to Excel**: The `with` statement is used for better resource management while writing to an Excel file.\n\nThis approach ensures that your confusion matrix will contain all classes from the test data, even if some of those classes are not present in the predictions."
