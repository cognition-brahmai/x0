        "content": "The issue you're encountering is likely due to the environment variable `NODE_ENV` not being set in the environment where your script is executed. When you're running the script from the command line, the environment variables might not be set the same way as they are when you run commands in the interactive Python prompt.\n\nHere are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and solve this problem:\n\n1. **Check Environment Variables:**\n   Make sure that the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is actually set in the environment where you're running the script. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   echo $NODE_ENV\n   ```\n\n   If this command returns nothing, then the environment variable is not set.\n\n2. **Set the Environment Variable:**\n   If `NODE_ENV` is not set, you can set it in your terminal session before running your script. For example:\n\n   ```bash\n   export NODE_ENV=development\n   python score.py\n   ```\n\n   Replace `development` with the appropriate environment you need (`production`, `integration`, etc.).\n\n3. **Modify Your Script to Handle Missing Environment Variables:**\n   Modify the `get_config` function to use a default value if `NODE_ENV` is not set. This can help your script handle the case where the environment variable is missing:\n\n   ```python\n   def get_config():\n       environment = os.environ.get('NODE_ENV', 'development')  # Default to 'development'\n       if environment == 'production':\n           filename = '../config/config-production.json'\n       elif environment == 'integration':\n           filename = '../config/config-integration.json'\n       else:\n           filename = '../config/config-dev.json'\n\n       with open(filename) as f:\n           return json.load(f)\n   ```\n\n   By using `os.environ.get('NODE_ENV', 'development')`, you ensure that the script will default to the 'development' configuration if `NODE_ENV` is not set.\n\n4. **Ensure Proper Exporting of Variables:**\n   If you're setting `NODE_ENV` in a shell script or a configuration file, make sure it's exported properly:\n\n   ```bash\n   export NODE_ENV=development\n   ```\n\n   The `export` command ensures that the variable is available to any subprocesses, like your Python script.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `KeyError` and ensure that your script can locate the appropriate configuration file based on the `NODE_ENV` environment variable."
