The weight carrying capacity of your boat can be calculated using the formula BoatCapacity = 500 * sin(2 * pi * (time / 10) + 0). The weight of your goods is not constant and can be calculated using the formula GoodsWeight = 100 + 50 * sin(2 * pi * (time / 12) + 0). Can you determine the maximum weight of goods you can carry at 5:30 PM? \nHint: The value of sin(x) can range from -1 to 1."

        "content": "To determine the maximum weight of goods that can be carried by the boat at 5:30 PM, we need to calculate the BoatCapacity and GoodsWeight at that specific time.\n\nFirst, let's convert 5:30 PM into a time value that can be used in the formula. Assuming the time is measured in hours and starting from midnight (0 hours), 5:30 PM is equivalent to 17.5 hours.\n\nNow, we'll calculate the BoatCapacity and GoodsWeight at this time:\n\n1. **BoatCapacity:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{BoatCapacity} = 500 \\times \\sin\\left(2 \\times \\pi \\times \\left(\\frac{17.5}{10}\\right)\\right)\n   \\]\n\n   Calculate the angle:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{17.5}{10} = 1.75\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   2 \\times \\pi \\times 1.75 = 3.5\\pi\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\sin(3.5\\pi) = \\sin(3\\pi + 0.5\\pi) = -\\sin(0.5\\pi) = -1\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, \n\n   \\[\n   \\text{BoatCapacity} = 500 \\times (-1) = -500 \\text{ kg}\n   \\]\n\n   However, since capacity can't be negative, we'll consider the absolute value for practical purposes:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{BoatCapacity} = 500 \\text{ kg}\n   \\]\n\n2. **GoodsWeight:**\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{GoodsWeight} = 100 + 50 \\times \\sin\\left(2 \\times \\pi \\times \\left(\\frac{17.5}{12}\\right)\\right)\n   \\]\n\n   Calculate the angle:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{17.5}{12} \\approx 1.4583\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   2 \\times \\pi \\times 1.4583 \\approx 2.9166\\pi\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   \\sin(2.9166\\pi) \\approx \\sin(2\\pi + 0.9166\\pi) = \\sin(0.9166\\pi)\n   \\]\n\n   Approximating further,\n\n   \\[\n   \\sin(0.9166\\pi) \\approx 0.707\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore,\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{GoodsWeight} = 100 + 50 \\times 0.707 \\approx 100 + 35.35 \\approx 135.35 \\text{ kg}\n   \\]\n\nThe boat's capacity at 5:30 PM is 500 kg (considering practical limits), and the goods weigh approximately 135.35 kg. Therefore, the goods can be carried without exceeding the boat's capacity."
