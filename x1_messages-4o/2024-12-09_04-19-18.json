        "content": "I'm experiencing a strange bug with Pandas and Numpy related to multithreading. When I run a script using Numpy's functions, it automatically enables multithreading, utilizing all 8 cores of my intel CPU workstation. This can be observed by cpu usage reaching 800% during the operation, as shown by the Linux 'top' command. However, if I perform an operation on two Pandas DataFrames before executing any Numpy function, the auto multithreading feature of Numpy appears to disappear without warning, with CPU usage dropping to 100%. Why would a Pandas DataFrame calculation affect Numpy's threading setting? Is this a bug and how can I resolve it?\n\nHere are the two scripts for comparison:\nScript 1:\n```python\nimport numpy as np    \nx=np.random.random(1000000)\nfor i in range(100000):\n    np.sqrt(x)\n```\nScript 2:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\ndf=pd.DataFrame(np.random.random((10,10)))\ndf+df\nx=np.random.random(1000000)\nfor i in range(100000):\n    np.sqrt(x)\n```\nAdditional investigations using the Linux 'perf' tool revealed that both scripts involve `libmkl_vml_avx2.so`, while the first script involves additional `libiomp5.so` which seems to be related to openMP. How can I ensure that the multithreading feature remains enabled despite performing operations on Pandas DataFrames?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is related to the interaction between Pandas and NumPy's use of multithreading libraries, such as Intel's Math Kernel Library (MKL) and OpenMP. When you perform operations using Pandas, it can sometimes affect the threading behavior of NumPy due to how these libraries handle threading at the backend.\n\nHere are several potential causes and solutions you can consider:\n\n### 1. **Threading Library Conflicts:**\n   - **Explanation:** When Pandas operations are performed, they might initialize or modify the threading settings for the underlying libraries (like MKL or OpenMP), which can affect subsequent NumPy operations.\n   - **Solution:** You can try explicitly setting the number of threads for NumPy operations using the `threadpoolctl` library. This allows you to control the number of threads used by the libraries.\n\n### 2. **Environment Variables:**\n   - **Explanation:** Threading behavior can be influenced by environment variables. For instance, `OMP_NUM_THREADS` or `MKL_NUM_THREADS` can limit the number of threads.\n   - **Solution:** Set these environment variables at the start of your script to ensure consistent behavior.\n     ```bash\n     export OMP_NUM_THREADS=8\n     export MKL_NUM_THREADS=8\n     ```\n\n### 3. **Using `threadpoolctl`:**\n   - **Solution:** Install the `threadpoolctl` package and use it to control the number of threads.\n     ```python\n     from threadpoolctl import threadpool_limits\n\n     # Set the number of threads for NumPy and related libraries\n     with threadpool_limits(limits=8):\n         # Your computation code here\n     ```\n\n### 4. **Pandas Version and Configuration:**\n   - **Explanation:** There might be differences in how different versions of Pandas handle threading. Ensure you are using the latest versions of Pandas and NumPy.\n   - **Solution:** Update your packages using pip:\n     ```bash\n     pip install --upgrade numpy pandas\n     ```\n\n### 5. **Check for Updates and Bug Reports:**\n   - **Explanation:** Sometimes, such behavior is due to a known bug in the library versions you're using.\n   - **Solution:** Check the GitHub repositories for Pandas and NumPy for any similar reported issues and updates.\n\n### 6. **Isolate Operations:**\n   - **Solution:** If the issue persists, consider performing the Pandas and NumPy operations in separate scripts or processes to avoid threading interference.\n\nBy trying these approaches, you should be able to maintain consistent multithreading behavior in your scripts, irrespective of Pandas operations."
