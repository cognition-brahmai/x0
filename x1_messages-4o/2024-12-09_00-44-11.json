I've found that `max(a, 3)` works as expected, even when `a` is `None`, returning `3` as my result. However, when using `min(b, 3)` and `b` is `None`, `b` remains `None`. Can anyone suggest an elegant way to make `min` return the number if one of the arguments is `None`?"

        "content": "In Python, when you're dealing with `None` values and you want to ensure that `min` and `max` functions behave as expected, you can use a lambda function or a custom helper function to handle the `None` cases explicitly. Since `None` is not comparable with integers directly, you need to provide a default value to use in such cases.\n\nHere's a simple and elegant way to handle this using a helper function:\n\n```python\ndef safe_min(value, default):\n    return min((v for v in (value, default) if v is not None))\n\ndef safe_max(value, default):\n    return max((v for v in (value, default) if v is not None))\n\n# Usage\na = None\nb = None\n\nresult_max = safe_max(a, 3)  # This will return 3\nresult_min = safe_min(b, 3)  # This will also return 3\n\nprint(\"Max result:\", result_max)\nprint(\"Min result:\", result_min)\n```\n\nIn this example, `safe_min` and `safe_max` functions filter out `None` values from the arguments, ensuring that only non-`None` values are considered for the comparison. This way, both functions will return the number when the other argument is `None`."
