However, when I try to print the result, it returns `<itertools.combinations object at 0x10049b470>`, rather than the combinations themselves. Why is this happening and how can I access the combinations? Here is the code I am using:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nnumber = [53, 64, 68, 71, 77, 82, 85]\n\nprint itertools.combinations(number, 4)\n```"

        "content": "The behavior you're seeing is because `itertools.combinations` returns an iterator in Python. When you print the iterator directly, it shows the memory address of the iterator object, rather than the combinations themselves. To access and print the actual combinations, you'll need to iterate over the iterator and print each combination.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to achieve that:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nnumber = [53, 64, 68, 71, 77, 82, 85]\n\n# Create the combinations iterator\ncombinations_iterator = itertools.combinations(number, 4)\n\n# Iterate over each combination and print it\nfor combination in combinations_iterator:\n    print(combination)\n```\n\nThis will output each combination of 4 numbers from your list. Each combination will be a tuple, and you'll see all possible combinations printed one by one."
