I have seen some Stack Overflow posts about this issue, but they seem to be related to global variables, which doesn't seem to apply in my case. In my code, I have a `__main__` function with some variable names, and it calls another function, `sample_func`, which uses those same variable names again. I thought that since I was in a different function, the scope of these variables would be local, but the warning seems to suggest otherwise. Here's a sample of my code for reference:\n\n```python\ndef sample_func():\n    for x in range(1, 5):  # --> shadows name x from outer scope\n        print x\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    for x in range(1, 5):\n        sample_func()\n```\n\nCan you help me understand what this warning means and how I can resolve it?"

        "content": "The warning \"Shadows name xyz from outer scope\" that you're encountering in PyCharm indicates that you have a variable name that is being reused in a way that might be confusing or unintended. In your code, the variable `x` is declared both in the `__main__` function and inside the `sample_func` function. Although these are in separate functions, PyCharm is alerting you to the potential for confusion because the same name is being used in different scopes.\n\nIn Python, variables defined inside a function have local scope to that function. This means that the `x` variable inside `sample_func` is not the same as the `x` variable in the `__main__` block; they are entirely separate. However, reusing the same name can lead to misunderstandings, especially in larger or more complex codebases. This is why PyCharm warns you about shadowing.\n\nTo resolve this warning, you can rename one of the variables to something more descriptive and unique. Here\u2019s how you could modify your code to avoid the warning:\n\n```python\ndef sample_func():\n    for y in range(1, 5):  # Renamed to 'y' to avoid shadowing\n        print(y)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    for x in range(1, 5):\n        sample_func()\n```\n\nIn this revised code, I've renamed the variable inside `sample_func` to `y`. By doing so, each variable has a unique name, which makes the code clearer and eliminates the shadowing warning. This practice of using distinct variable names helps improve code readability and maintainability."
