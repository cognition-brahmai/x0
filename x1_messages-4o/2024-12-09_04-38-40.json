In some Python versions, a build of the interpreter with `m` at the end signifies that it was compiled with the `--with-pymalloc` option enabled. This option is used to enable Python's own small object allocator, which can provide better performance for memory management in Python programs by handling small objects more efficiently.\n\nIn summary, `python3.3m` indicates that this particular version of the Python interpreter has been built with the pymalloc memory allocator enabled. This is generally beneficial for performance, but functionally, it should behave the same as the standard build of the Python interpreter."
