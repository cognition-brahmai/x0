Currently, I'm doing this using a for loop as shown:\n\n```python\nfor i in xrange(len(l) - 1):\n    x = l[i]\n    y = l[i + 1]\n    # do something\n```\n\nBut I would like to do this in a more compact way, like `for x, y in someiterator(l): ...` Is there a way to do this using builtin Python iterators? I'm sure the `itertools` module should have a solution, but I just can't figure it out."

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve this using the `itertools` module, specifically with the `zip` function combined with slicing. Here's how you can iterate over all pairs of consecutive list items in a more compact way:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nl = [1, 7, 3, 5]\nfor x, y in zip(l, l[1:]):\n    # do something with x and y\n    print(x, y)\n```\n\nIn this example, `zip(l, l[1:])` pairs each element in the list with the next one, effectively creating the pairs `(1, 7), (7, 3), (3, 5)`.\n\nAlternatively, you can use `itertools.pairwise` if you are using Python 3.10 or later, which provides this functionality directly:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import pairwise\n\nl = [1, 7, 3, 5]\nfor x, y in pairwise(l):\n    # do something with x and y\n    print(x, y)\n```\n\nUsing `pairwise` is a very clean and efficient way to iterate over consecutive pairs in a list."
