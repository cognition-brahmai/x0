Both of them are described in the documentation as \"Split arrays or matrices into random train and test subsets\". Can someone explain the difference and suggest which one should be used and when?"

        "content": "Certainly! The difference between `from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split` and `from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split` is mainly historical and relates to the version of scikit-learn you are using.\n\n1. **`from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split`:**\n   - This was the original import path in older versions of scikit-learn, specifically before version 0.18.\n   - The `cross_validation` module was used for various model selection and validation routines, including splitting datasets into train and test sets.\n\n2. **`from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split`:**\n   - Starting from scikit-learn version 0.18, the `cross_validation` module was deprecated and eventually removed in favor of the `model_selection` module.\n   - The `model_selection` module provides a more comprehensive and updated set of tools for model selection and evaluation.\n   - This is the recommended import path for versions 0.18 and above.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- If you are using scikit-learn version 0.18 or later (which is quite likely), you should use `from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split`. This ensures compatibility with the latest updates and improvements in the library.\n- If you are working with an older codebase that still uses the `cross_validation` import, it is advisable to update the code to use `model_selection` to maintain forward compatibility.\n\nOverall, always prefer using the latest version of libraries and their corresponding modules to benefit from improvements, bug fixes, and new features."
