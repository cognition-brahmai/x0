When type checking in pyCharm, I'm encountering the following error:\n\n```\nExpected type 'Optional[Coroutine]', got '(args: Tuple[Any, ...], kwargs: Dict[str, Any]) -> Coroutine[Any, Any, None]' instead\n```\n\nCan anyone guide me on how to rectify this?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering stems from a misunderstanding of the types involved. The `consumer` function is expecting a `Coroutine` object, but `test` is an asynchronous function that returns a coroutine when called, not a coroutine itself. To fix this, you should change the type hint for the `consumer` function to expect a callable that returns a coroutine, rather than a coroutine itself. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Callable, Awaitable, Optional\n\n# Define an asynchronous function\nasync def test(*args, **kwargs):\n    pass\n\n# Modify consumer to accept a Callable that returns an Awaitable\ndef consumer(function_: Optional[Callable[..., Awaitable[None]]]=None):\n    if function_ is not None:\n        # Call the function to ensure it's an async function returning a coroutine\n        coroutine = function_()\n        # To demonstrate, let's check the type of the coroutine\n        print(f\"The returned coroutine is: {coroutine}\")\n\n# Pass the async function to the consumer\nconsumer(test)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Type Hint Update**: Use `Callable[..., Awaitable[None]]` instead of `Coroutine`. This indicates that the parameter is a callable (i.e., function) that returns an `Awaitable` (in this case, a coroutine).\n2. **Calling the Function**: Inside the `consumer`, call the function to get the coroutine. This ensures that `consumer` is working with a coroutine object when necessary.\n\nThis should resolve the type checking issue you're encountering in PyCharm."
