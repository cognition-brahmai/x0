My project has the following structure:\n\n```\nCineaste/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 cineaste/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 metadata_errors.py\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 metadata.py\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 tests/\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 docs/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 LICENSE\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 setup.py\n```\n\nIn this project, `metadata.py` imports `metadata_errors.py` using the relative path expression `from .metadata_errors.py import *`. The file runs perfectly fine in PyCharm 2016, but when I try to debug `metadata.py`, I receive the following error: \n\n```\nfrom .metadata_errors import *\nSystemError: Parent module '' not loaded, cannot perform relative import\n```\n\nPyCharm debugger is being called like this:\n\n```\n/home/myself/.pyenv/versions/cineaste/bin/python /home/myself/bin/pycharm-2016.1.3/helpers/pydev/pydevd.py --multiproc --module --qt-support --client 127.0.0.1 --port 52790 --file cineaste.metadata\n```\n\nHow can I resolve this issue?"

        "content": "To resolve the issue with relative imports in PyCharm while debugging, you'll need to ensure that your script is executed in the context of the package. This can be done by setting the working directory correctly and understanding how Python's import system works with relative imports. Here's a step-by-step guide to configure your project:\n\n1. **Configure the Working Directory:**\n   - Open your project in PyCharm.\n   - Go to `Run` > `Edit Configurations...`.\n   - Select the configuration for your script (or create a new one if it doesn't exist).\n   - Set the \"Working directory\" to the directory that contains the `cineaste` package (i.e., the `Cineaste/` directory).\n   - This ensures that when the script is executed, Python recognizes the package structure properly.\n\n2. **Use the Module Name Instead of the File Path:**\n   - In the \"Script path\" field of the configuration, use the module name instead of the file path. For example, instead of pointing to `cineaste/metadata.py`, use `cineaste.metadata`.\n   - This will make sure that Python treats `metadata.py` as a module within the `cineaste` package.\n\n3. **Check the PYTHONPATH:**\n   - Make sure that the `Cineaste/` directory is included in the `PYTHONPATH`. This can be done by adding it to the environment variables in the run configuration.\n   - In the \"Environment variables\" field, add `PYTHONPATH` with the value of your project's root directory (`Cineaste/`).\n\n4. **Debugging Configuration:**\n   - If you're still facing issues, consider using absolute imports instead. While relative imports are useful, they can be tricky when running scripts directly or during debugging.\n   - Alternatively, you can add a script to run your module as a package using the `-m` flag. For example:\n     ```bash\n     python -m cineaste.metadata\n     ```\n   - This approach enforces the script to be run as part of the package, which resolves the relative import issues.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to debug your `metadata.py` script without encountering the relative import error. If you continue to have issues, double-check that the `__init__.py` files are present to ensure the directories are recognized as packages."
