Below is a step-by-step guide:\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Your React Project\n\n1. **Install Node.js and npm**: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).\n\n2. **Create a New React App**:\n   Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new React application using Create React App:\n\n   ```bash\n   npx create-react-app car-list-app\n   ```\n\n3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:\n   ```bash\n   cd car-list-app\n   ```\n\n4. **Install React Router**:\n   React Router will be used for navigation between pages.\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install react-router-dom\n   ```\n\n### Step 2: Create Components\n\n1. **App Component**: This will be the main component that includes routing.\n\n2. **CarList Component**: This component will display the list of cars.\n\n3. **CarDetail Component**: This component will display detailed information about a specific car.\n\n### Step 3: Implement Routing\n\nEdit `src/App.js` to set up routing:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport CarList from './components/CarList';\nimport CarDetail from './components/CarDetail';\n\nconst App = () => {\n  return (\n    <Router>\n      <Switch>\n        <Route path=\"/\" exact component={CarList} />\n        <Route path=\"/car/:id\" component={CarDetail} />\n      </Switch>\n    </Router>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\n### Step 4: Implement CarList Component\n\nCreate a file `src/components/CarList.js`:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nconst cars = [\n  { id: 1, make: 'Toyota', model: 'Corolla', year: 2020, engineSize: '1.8L', price: '$20,000' },\n  { id: 2, make: 'Honda', model: 'Civic', year: 2019, engineSize: '2.0L', price: '$22,000' },\n  // Add more car objects as needed\n];\n\nconst CarList = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Car List</h1>\n      <ul>\n        {cars.map((car) => (\n          <li key={car.id}>\n            <Link to={`/car/${car.id}`}>{car.make} {car.model}</Link>\n          </li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default CarList;\n```\n\n### Step 5: Implement CarDetail Component\n\nCreate a file `src/components/CarDetail.js`:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nconst cars = [\n  { id: 1, make: 'Toyota', model: 'Corolla', year: 2020, engineSize: '1.8L', price: '$20,000' },\n  { id: 2, make: 'Honda', model: 'Civic', year: 2019, engineSize: '2.0L', price: '$22,000' },\n  // Add more car objects as needed\n];\n\nconst CarDetail = () => {\n  const { id } = useParams();\n  const car = cars.find((car) => car.id === parseInt(id));\n\n  if (!car) {\n    return <div>Car not found</div>;\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{car.make} {car.model}</h1>\n      <p>Year: {car.year}</p>\n      <p>Engine Size: {car.engineSize}</p>\n      <p>Price: {car.price}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default CarDetail;\n```\n\n### Step 6: Run Your Application\n\nStart your React app by running:\n\n```bash\nnpm start\n```\n\nThis will launch the application on `http://localhost:3000`. You should see a list of cars on the home page, and clicking on a car will take you to a detail page with more information.\n\n### Additional Enhancements\n\n- **Styling**: Use CSS or a CSS-in-JS library to style your components for a better user interface.\n- **Data Management**: Consider using state management libraries like Redux for larger applications.\n- **API Integration**: Replace the static car data with data from an API if needed.\n\nThis setup provides a basic structure to get you started with a React application that handles routing and displays data dynamically."
