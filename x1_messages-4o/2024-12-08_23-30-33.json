To display the top 10 processes consuming the most CPU on a Linux system, you can use the following `ps` command:\n\n```bash\nps -eo pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | head -n 11\n```\n\nThis command lists processes with their Process ID (PID), Parent Process ID (PPID), command name, memory usage, and CPU usage, sorted by CPU usage in descending order. The `head -n 11` is used to display the top 10 processes plus the header line.\n\nTo sort the processes by memory usage instead, you can adjust the `--sort` parameter to sort by `%mem`:\n\n```bash\nps -eo pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%mem | head -n 11\n```\n\nThis will give you the top 10 processes consuming the most memory."
