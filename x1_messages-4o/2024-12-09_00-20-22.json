However, I'm encountering an error stating `'XGBClassifier' object has no attribute 'use_label_encoder'`. This problem occurs when I run my code on a Linux machine using AWS Sagemaker Notebook, but not on my local macOS. I have installed the same version of xgboost (1.4.1) on both machines. How can I fix this issue?\n\nHere is the code I'm using to load the model:\n\n```python\nimport pickle\ndef load_pkl(fname):\n    with open(fname, 'rb') as f:\n        obj = pickle.load(f)\n    return obj\n\nmodel = load_pkl('model_0_unrestricted.pkl')\n```\n\nAnd here is the error message:\n\n```python\n~/anaconda3/envs/python3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/xgboost/sklearn.py in get_params(self, deep)\n    436             if k == 'type' and type(self).__name__ != v:\n    437                 msg = 'Current model type: {}, '.format(type(self).__name__) + \\\n--> 438                       'type of model in file: {}'.format(v)\n    439                 raise TypeError(msg)\n    440             if k == 'type':\n\n~/anaconda3/envs/python3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/sklearn/base.py in get_params(self, deep)\n    193         out = dict()\n    194         for key in self._get_param_names():\n--> 195             value = getattr(self, key)\n    196             if deep and hasattr(value, 'get_params'):\n    197                 deep_items = value.get_params().items()\n\nAttributeError: 'XGBClassifier' object has no attribute 'use_label_encoder'\n```"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to the version of the XGBoost library and its interaction with scikit-learn. The `use_label_encoder` attribute was deprecated starting from XGBoost version 1.3.0. However, it seems like there might be some inconsistencies in how the model was serialized and deserialized, especially in different environments.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check and Align Library Versions:**\n   - Ensure that both environments have the exact same versions of XGBoost, scikit-learn, and any other relevant libraries. Use `pip show xgboost` and `pip show scikit-learn` to verify the versions.\n   - If there are inconsistencies, align the versions by upgrading/downgrading the packages using `pip install xgboost==1.4.1` and similar commands for scikit-learn.\n\n2. **Explicitly Set `use_label_encoder`:**\n   - If the model was trained with a version of XGBoost that required `use_label_encoder=False`, you might need to set this explicitly after loading the model. However, since this attribute has been removed in later versions, you might need to handle this carefully.\n   - Try setting this attribute manually if it exists:\n     ```python\n     model = load_pkl('model_0_unrestricted.pkl')\n     if hasattr(model, 'use_label_encoder'):\n         model.use_label_encoder = False\n     ```\n\n3. **Re-save the Model Using `xgboost` Save Method:**\n   - If possible, re-save the model using the XGBoost's in-built save and load functions, which are more robust across different environments:\n     ```python\n     # Assuming you have the original model object\n     model.save_model('model_0_unrestricted.json')\n     # Load the model\n     model = xgb.XGBClassifier()\n     model.load_model('model_0_unrestricted.json')\n     ```\n   - This avoids potential issues with pickling objects across different library versions and platforms.\n\n4. **Re-train the Model (if feasible):**\n   - If the above solutions do not work and you have the data and resources, consider re-training the model in the environment where you wish to use it. This ensures compatibility.\n\n5. **Environment Consistency:**\n   - Ensure that both environments (local macOS and AWS SageMaker) use the same Python version and packages. You can use virtual environments or Docker containers to maintain consistency.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to address the issue and successfully load your XGBoost model across different environments."
