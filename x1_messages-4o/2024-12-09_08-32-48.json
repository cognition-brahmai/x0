For instance, I have this dictionary `d = {'a' : [], 'b' : [], 'c' : []}`. I would like to use `defaultdict` as it seems more Pythonic, but I am not sure how to setup the default keys as I am only adding values to my dictionary if a specific key in another structure contains in my dictionary."

        "content": "To initialize a `defaultdict` in Python with default keys, you can start by using the `collections.defaultdict` class and providing it a default factory function, such as `list` for a dictionary of lists. However, `defaultdict` does not directly allow you to prepopulate keys with empty lists. You'll need to do this manually after creating the `defaultdict`.\n\nHere's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\n# Initialize the defaultdict with list as the default factory\nd = defaultdict(list)\n\n# Prepopulate the defaultdict with your desired keys\ninitial_keys = ['a', 'b', 'c']\nfor key in initial_keys:\n    d[key]  # This will initialize the key with an empty list\n\n# Now you can use the defaultdict as required\n# For example, adding items to the lists\nd['a'].append(1)\nd['b'].extend([2, 3])\nd['c'].append(4)\n\nprint(d)\n```\n\nIn this example, `d` is a `defaultdict` where each key is associated with a list. By iterating over `initial_keys`, you ensure that the keys `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'` exist in the dictionary, each initialized with an empty list. After this setup, you can add values to the lists as needed, and if you access any new key that hasn't been explicitly initialized, it will automatically be initialized with an empty list due to the default factory function."
