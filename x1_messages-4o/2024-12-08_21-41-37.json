The equation will be given as input, for example (x + 3)(2x - 5), and the output should be in the form of 2x^2 - 7x - 15. Can you provide a Swift code for this?\nHere is a sample Swift code that can expand a given equation in the specified form:\n```Swift\nfunc expandEquation(_ input: String) -> String? {\n    let components = input.components(separatedBy: CharacterSet(charactersIn: \"()+-\"))\n    guard components.count == 4, let a = Int(components[1]), let b = Int(components[2]), let c = Int(components[3]) else {\n        return nil\n    }\n    let expanded = \"\\(a * b)x^2 + \\((a * c) + (b * a))x + \\(a * c)\"\n    return expanded\n}\nlet inputEquation = \"(x + 3)(2x - 5)\"\nif let result = expandEquation(inputEquation) {\n    print(result)\n}\n```\nThis code first extracts the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input equation, then uses these values to compute the expanded form of the equation. The result is returned as a string. You can modify this code to suit your specific needs."

        "content": "The concept of expanding an equation like \\((x + a)(b x + c)\\) involves using the distributive property to multiply each term in the first binomial by each term in the second. Here's a revised Swift code to accomplish this task correctly, including handling both positive and negative numbers:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nfunc expandEquation(_ input: String) -> String? {\n    // Removing spaces and splitting based on specific characters\n    let cleanInput = input.replacingOccurrences(of: \" \", with: \"\")\n    let regex = try! NSRegularExpression(pattern: #\"\\((x([+-]\\d+))\\)\\((\\d+)x([+-]\\d+)\\)\"#)\n    let matches = regex.matches(in: cleanInput, range: NSRange(location: 0, length: cleanInput.count))\n    \n    guard let match = matches.first, match.numberOfRanges == 5 else {\n        return nil\n    }\n\n    // Extract values from the input using the captured groups\n    func extractValue(from range: NSRange) -> Int? {\n        if let range = Range(range, in: cleanInput) {\n            return Int(cleanInput[range])\n        }\n        return nil\n    }\n\n    guard \n        let a = extractValue(from: match.range(at: 2)),\n        let b = extractValue(from: match.range(at: 3)),\n        let c = extractValue(from: match.range(at: 4))\n    else {\n        return nil\n    }\n    \n    // Calculate the coefficients of the expanded form\n    let a1 = b\n    let b1 = (a * b) + c\n    let c1 = a * c\n    \n    // Assemble the expanded equation, taking care of signs\n    let expanded = \"\\(a1)x^2 \\((b1 >= 0 ? \"+\" : \"\"))\\(b1)x \\((c1 >= 0 ? \"+\" : \"\"))\\(c1)\"\n    return expanded\n}\n\nlet inputEquation = \"(x + 3)(2x - 5)\"\nif let result = expandEquation(inputEquation) {\n    print(result)\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Input Parsing**: We use a regular expression to extract the numbers and operators from the input string. The pattern `\\((x([+-]\\d+))\\)\\((\\d+)x([+-]\\d+)\\)` captures the numbers and signs for `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n\n2. **Extract Values**: We define a helper function to extract and convert the matched substrings into integers.\n\n3. **Calculating Coefficients**: The coefficients are calculated based on the expansion formula:\n   - The coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is \\(b\\).\n   - The coefficient of \\(x\\) is \\((a \\cdot b) + c\\).\n   - The constant term is \\(a \\cdot c\\).\n\n4. **Formatting the Output**: We build the output string by ensuring proper sign handling for each term.\n\nThis code provides flexibility and accuracy for expanding such equations provided in the specified format."
