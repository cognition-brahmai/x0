I am currently using the \"question mark style\" for substituting values into queries but it fails when used for table or column names. The sqlite3 module or PEP 249 doesn't seem to offer a function for escaping names or values and I am not sure of the appropriate method to use variable names for columns or tables in SQLite without any other dependencies."

        "content": "When working with SQLite in Python, using the `sqlite3` module, you can safely substitute values into queries using the \"question mark style\" for placeholders. However, this method does not work for table or column names. When you need to use variable names for tables or columns, you should manually construct your SQL query strings while ensuring that the identifiers are safe and properly quoted.\n\nHere's a basic approach:\n\n1. **Validate and Sanitize Input**: Ensure that any table or column names are valid SQLite identifiers and do not come from untrusted sources to avoid SQL injection risks.\n\n2. **Use Double Quotes**: In SQLite, you should wrap table or column names in double quotes to handle special characters or reserved keywords.\n\nHere's an example of how you can construct a query with dynamic table and column names:\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\n\ndef execute_query_with_dynamic_names(db_path, table_name, column_name, value):\n    # Ensure table_name and column_name are safe and valid identifiers\n    if not table_name.isidentifier() or not column_name.isidentifier():\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid table or column name.\")\n\n    # Connect to the SQLite database\n    conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)\n    cursor = conn.cursor()\n\n    # Construct the SQL query with dynamic table and column names\n    query = f'SELECT \"{column_name}\" FROM \"{table_name}\" WHERE \"{column_name}\" = ?'\n\n    # Execute the query with the value\n    cursor.execute(query, (value,))\n    results = cursor.fetchall()\n\n    # Close the connection\n    conn.close()\n\n    return results\n\n# Example usage\ndb_path = 'example.db'\ntable_name = 'my_table'\ncolumn_name = 'my_column'\nvalue = 'some_value'\n\nresults = execute_query_with_dynamic_names(db_path, table_name, column_name, value)\nprint(results)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Validation**: It's crucial to validate that `table_name` and `column_name` are valid SQLite identifiers to mitigate SQL injection risks.\n- **Quoting**: Use double quotes around identifiers to handle cases where the names might contain special characters or conflict with SQL keywords.\n- **Parameterized Queries**: Always use parameterized queries for substituting values to protect against SQL injection.\n\nBy following these practices, you can safely work with dynamic table and column names in SQLite using Python."
