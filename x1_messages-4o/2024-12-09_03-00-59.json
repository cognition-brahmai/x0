I attempted to open a URL and read its contents with the following code:\n```python\nf = urllib.urlopen(\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Albert_Einstein&amp;printable=yes\")           \ns = f.read()\nf.close()\n```\nHowever, I received an error message indicating that my access was denied. I suspect this is because Wikipedia is blocking requests not from a standard browser. Here is the error message I received:\n```python\nRequest: GET http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Albert_Einstein&amp;printable=yes, from 192.35.17.11 via knsq1.knams.wikimedia.org (squid/2.6.STABLE21) to ()\nError: ERR_ACCESS_DENIED, errno [No Error] at Tue, 23 Sep 2008 09:09:08 GMT \n```\nDo you know how to bypass this issue?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is likely due to Wikipedia blocking requests that don't include a user-agent string, which is a common security measure to prevent automated scripts from scraping their data without identifying themselves as legitimate users.\n\nYou can bypass this by adding a user-agent header to your request, which will make it appear more like a request from a regular web browser. Here's how you can do this using Python's `urllib` module:\n\n```python\nimport urllib.request\n\n# Define the URL of the Wikipedia article\nurl = \"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Albert_Einstein&printable=yes\"\n\n# Define a user-agent string\nheaders = {'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3'}\n\n# Create a request object with the URL and headers\nreq = urllib.request.Request(url, headers=headers)\n\n# Open the URL and read the contents\nwith urllib.request.urlopen(req) as response:\n    s = response.read()\n\n# Print the content (you can also process it as needed)\nprint(s.decode('utf-8'))\n```\n\nThis code snippet sets a user-agent header to mimic a request from a web browser, which should allow you to access the Wikipedia page without being blocked. You can modify the user-agent string as needed to match different browsers or devices."
