You know that 40% of your sports equipment is made of eco-friendly materials, and that the carbon emissions from shipping your products can be calculated using the formula 0.05x, where x is the distance in miles. \nNow, let's say you want to create a sustainability index that takes both of these factors into account. How can you do this? \nHint: The sustainability index should be a single number between 0 and 100 that represents the overall environmental impact of your sports equipment."

        "content": "To create a sustainability index that takes into account both the percentage of eco-friendly materials used and the carbon emissions from shipping, we need to combine these two factors into a single formula that results in a number between 0 and 100. Here's one way you could do it:\n\n1. **Eco-Friendly Materials Contribution**: Since 40% of your sports equipment is made of eco-friendly materials, this can directly contribute to the sustainability index. Let's say that using eco-friendly materials can contribute up to 50 points to the index. Since you are currently at 40%, this would contribute \\(0.4 \\times 50 = 20\\) points.\n\n2. **Carbon Emissions Contribution**: We need to consider how shipping impacts sustainability. We can use the carbon emissions formula \\(0.05x\\), where \\(x\\) is the distance in miles. To keep this within a 50-point scale, you could define a threshold distance that represents the 'worst case' scenario, for which the carbon emissions would contribute 0 points (maximum negative impact). For example, let's assume a threshold of 2000 miles. \n\n   The carbon emissions contribution to the index can be calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Carbon Contribution} = 50 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{0.05x}{\\text{Max Emission}}\\right)\n   \\]\n   where \\(\\text{Max Emission} = 0.05 \\times 2000 = 100\\).\n\n   So, for a given distance \\(x\\),\n   \\[\n   \\text{Carbon Contribution} = 50 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{0.05x}{100}\\right) = 50 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{2000}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n   This will give a score between 0 and 50, depending on the distance.\n\n3. **Sustainability Index Calculation**: Combine these two contributions to calculate the sustainability index:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sustainability Index} = \\text{Eco-Friendly Materials Contribution} + \\text{Carbon Contribution}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sustainability Index} = 20 + 50 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{2000}\\right)\n   \\]\n\n   This index will range from 0 to 100, where higher values represent better sustainability.\n\nIn summary, the sustainability index can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\text{Sustainability Index} = 20 + 50 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{2000}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThis formula allows you to adjust the index based on the distance of shipping, giving a comprehensive view of the sustainability of your sports equipment."
