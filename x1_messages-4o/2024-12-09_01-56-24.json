        "content": "In Matplotlib, you can adjust the space between legend markers and labels by using the `handletextpad` parameter in the `legend()` function. This parameter controls the padding between the legend handle (marker) and the text label. By default, this spacing may appear too large, but you can reduce it to better suit your needs. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Sample data\nx = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\ny1 = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]\ny2 = [1, 4, 6, 8, 9]\n\n# Create a plot\nplt.plot(x, y1, label='Data 1')\nplt.plot(x, y2, label='Data 2')\n\n# Add a legend with adjusted handletextpad\nplt.legend(handletextpad=0.5)  # Adjust this value as needed\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this example, `handletextpad=0.5` sets the padding between the legend markers and their corresponding labels to 0.5 units. You can adjust the value to make the spacing smaller or larger, depending on your preference."
