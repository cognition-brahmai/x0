However, when I try to run a sample code in Eclipse, I encounter the following error: `OpenCV Error: No GPU support (The library is compiled without CUDA support) in mallocPitch, file /home/muad/Source/OpenCV-2.4.2/modules/core/src/gpumat.cpp, line 749`. Despite rebuilding my OpenCV, the error persists. How can I resolve this?"

        "content": "It seems like the OpenCV version on your system is not built with CUDA support, which is necessary for GPU acceleration. Follow these steps to ensure OpenCV is built with CUDA support:\n\n1. **Remove any existing OpenCV installations**: Before rebuilding, make sure there are no conflicting versions of OpenCV on your system. You can remove them using:\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get remove --purge libopencv*\n   ```\n\n2. **Check CUDA Installation**: Ensure that your CUDA installation is correct and the paths are set correctly. You can verify your CUDA installation by running:\n   ```bash\n   nvcc --version\n   ```\n\n3. **Download OpenCV and OpenCV Contrib**: Download the latest OpenCV and OpenCV Contrib modules from the official GitHub repository:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git\n   git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib.git\n   ```\n\n4. **Prepare the Build Directory**: Create a build directory inside the OpenCV source directory:\n   ```bash\n   cd opencv\n   mkdir build\n   cd build\n   ```\n\n5. **Configure the Build with CMake**: Use CMake to configure the OpenCV build. Ensure you enable CUDA support:\n   ```bash\n   cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \\\n         -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local \\\n         -D OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=../../opencv_contrib/modules \\\n         -D WITH_CUDA=ON \\\n         -D WITH_CUDNN=ON \\\n         -D OPENCV_DNN_CUDA=ON \\\n         -D CUDA_ARCH_BIN=7.5 \\  # Use the appropriate CUDA architecture for your GPU\n         -D CUDA_ARCH_PTX=7.5 \\  # Use the appropriate CUDA architecture for your GPU\n         -D WITH_CUBLAS=ON ..\n   ```\n\n   Replace `7.5` in `CUDA_ARCH_BIN` and `CUDA_ARCH_PTX` with the compute capability of your GPU. You can refer to NVIDIA's documentation to find your GPU's compute capability.\n\n6. **Build OpenCV**: Compile OpenCV with the following commands:\n   ```bash\n   make -j$(nproc)\n   ```\n\n7. **Install OpenCV**: Once the build is complete, install OpenCV:\n   ```bash\n   sudo make install\n   sudo ldconfig\n   ```\n\n8. **Verify the Installation**: You can verify the installation by running a sample OpenCV code that utilizes CUDA to ensure everything is working fine.\n\n9. **Set Environment Variables**: Ensure that the environment variables for CUDA and OpenCV are set in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:\n   ```bash\n   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH\n   ```\n\nAfter following these steps, your OpenCV should be configured with CUDA support, and you should no longer encounter the error message related to missing GPU support."
