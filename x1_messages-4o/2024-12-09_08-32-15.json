        "content": "To automatically generate documentation for your Python package using Sphinx, you can use the `sphinx-apidoc` tool, which can generate reStructuredText (reST) files for your entire package, including submodules. Here's a step-by-step guide to set it up:\n\n1. **Install Sphinx and Autodoc**: If you haven\u2019t already, make sure you have Sphinx installed along with the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install sphinx\n   ```\n\n2. **Create the Sphinx Project**: If you haven't initialized your Sphinx project, do so by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   sphinx-quickstart\n   ```\n\n   This will guide you through setting up a basic Sphinx configuration. If you already have a Sphinx project, you can skip this step.\n\n3. **Use sphinx-apidoc**: Generate the reST files using `sphinx-apidoc`. This tool will scan your package and generate documentation stubs for each module. Run the following command from the root directory of your project:\n\n   ```bash\n   sphinx-apidoc -o docs/source your_package/\n   ```\n\n   Replace `docs/source` with the path to the directory where you want to store the generated reST files, and `your_package/` with the path to your Python package.\n\n4. **Configure conf.py**: Make sure your `conf.py` is set up correctly to include the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension. You might also want to add the package path to `sys.path` to ensure Sphinx can import your modules correctly.\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   import sys\n   sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../your_package'))\n\n   extensions = [\n       'sphinx.ext.autodoc',\n       'sphinx.ext.viewcode',\n   ]\n\n   # Optional: Use napoleon for Google-style docstrings\n   extensions.append('sphinx.ext.napoleon')\n   ```\n\n5. **Edit index.rst**: Include the generated reST files in your `index.rst` (or equivalent) to ensure they are part of the documentation build process. You can include them using the `toctree` directive.\n\n   ```rst\n   .. toctree::\n      :maxdepth: 2\n      :caption: Contents:\n\n      module1\n      module2\n   ```\n\n   Replace `module1`, `module2`, etc., with the names of the reST files generated by `sphinx-apidoc`.\n\n6. **Build the Documentation**: Finally, build your documentation using:\n\n   ```bash\n   sphinx-build -b html docs/source docs/build\n   ```\n\n   Again, replace `docs/source` and `docs/build` with the appropriate paths.\n\n7. **Troubleshooting Imports**: If your package has complex import requirements or dependencies, make sure they are installed and accessible. You might need to adjust the `sys.path` in your `conf.py` to point to the right directories.\n\nBy following these steps, Sphinx should be able to recursively parse your package and automatically generate documentation for all classes, methods, and functions it encounters. If you encounter any specific errors, you can provide details, and I can help troubleshoot further."
