In my current code, I perform cross-validation by storing the accuracies and printing the average later. However, I'd like to produce a classification report that specifies class-wise precision and recall, instead of just a mean accuracy score at the end. How can I modify my code to get a report similar to the one produced without cross-validation, even when using cross-validation?\n\nHere is my current code:\n\n```python\nimport random\nfrom sklearn import cross_validation\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\n\ndef multinomial_nb_with_cv(x_train, y_train):\n    random.shuffle(X)\n    kf = cross_validation.KFold(len(X), n_folds=10)\n    acc = []\n    for train_index, test_index in kf:\n        y_true = y_train[test_index]\n        clf = MultinomialNB().fit(x_train[train_index], y_train[train_index])\n        y_pred = clf.predict(x_train[test_index])\n        acc.append(accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred))\n```\n\nCode for report without cross-validation:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\n\ndef multinomial_nb(x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test):\n    clf = MultinomialNB().fit(x_train, y_train)\n    y_pred = clf.predict(x_test)\n    y_true = y_test\n    print classification_report(y_true, y_pred)\n```\n\nThis is the kind of report I'd like to generate:\n\n```\nprecision    recall  f1-score   support\n\n  0       0.50      0.24      0.33       221\n  1       0.00      0.00      0.00        18\n  2       0.00      0.00      0.00        27\n  3       0.00      0.00      0.00        28\n  4       0.00      0.00      0.00        32\n  5       0.04      0.02      0.02        57\n  6       0.00      0.00      0.00        26\n  7       0.00      0.00      0.00        25\n  8       0.00      0.00      0.00        43\n  9       0.00      0.00      0.00        99\n 10       0.63      0.98      0.76       716\n\navg / total       0.44      0.59      0.48      1292\n```\nCan you help me modify my code to achieve this?"

To generate a classification report that includes class-wise precision, recall, and F1-score during cross-validation, you'll need to collect predictions for each fold and then compute the classification report at the end. \n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import KFold\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report\n\ndef multinomial_nb_with_cv(x_train, y_train):\n    random.shuffle(X)\n    kf = KFold(n_splits=10)\n    \n    # Initialize lists to store true and predicted labels\n    y_true_all = []\n    y_pred_all = []\n    \n    for train_index, test_index in kf.split(x_train):\n        # Split the data into train and test sets for this fold\n        X_train, X_test = x_train[train_index], x_train[test_index]\n        y_train_fold, y_test_fold = y_train[train_index], y_train[test_index]\n        \n        # Train the classifier\n        clf = MultinomialNB().fit(X_train, y_train_fold)\n        \n        # Predict on the test set\n        y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)\n        \n        # Store the true and predicted labels\n        y_true_all.extend(y_test_fold)\n        y_pred_all.extend(y_pred)\n    \n    # Convert lists to numpy arrays for compatibility with sklearn functions\n    y_true_all = np.array(y_true_all)\n    y_pred_all = np.array(y_pred_all)\n    \n    # Print the classification report\n    print(classification_report(y_true_all, y_pred_all))\n\n# Example usage\n# Assuming x_train and y_train are your data and labels\n# multinomial_nb_with_cv(x_train, y_train)\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Use `KFold` from `sklearn.model_selection`**: The `cross_validation` module is deprecated, so it's better to use `KFold` from `sklearn.model_selection`.\n\n2. **Aggregate True and Predicted Labels**: Collect all true and predicted labels across all folds in `y_true_all` and `y_pred_all`.\n\n3. **Generate Classification Report**: After the cross-validation loop, generate and print the classification report using `classification_report`.\n\nBy making these changes, you can generate a detailed classification report for your multi-class classification problem using cross-validation."
