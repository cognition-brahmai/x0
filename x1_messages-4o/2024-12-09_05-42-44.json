However, when I run `prospector`, `pyflake` warns me that `__salt__` is undefined and `mypy` also reports the same issue. I am aware that I can ignore either `pyflake` with `# noqa: F821` or `mypy` with `# type: ignore` on that particular line. My question is, how can I ignore this for both `pyflake` and `mypy`?"

Use `# noqa: F821` to ignore the warning from `pyflake`.\n2. Use `# type: ignore` to ignore the warning from `mypy`.\n\nYou can place both of these comments on the same line where `__salt__` is used. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nresult = __salt__['some_function']()  # noqa: F821  # type: ignore\n```\n\nBy adding both comments, you're instructing `pyflake` to ignore the undefined variable warning with `# noqa: F821` and `mypy` to ignore the type checking issue with `# type: ignore`.\n\nThis way, you can suppress warnings from both tools for the specific line where `__salt__` is used."
