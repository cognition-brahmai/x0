What is this shorthand for? \n\n```\ndef play_game(word_list):\n    hand = deal_hand(HAND_SIZE) # random init\n    while True:\n        cmd = raw_input('Enter n to deal a new hand, r to replay the last hand, or e to end game: ')\n        if cmd == 'n':\n            hand = deal_hand(HAND_SIZE)\n            play_hand(hand.copy(), word_list)\n            print\n        elif cmd == 'r':\n            play_hand(hand.copy(), word_list)\n            print\n        elif cmd == 'e':\n            break\n        else:\n            print \"Invalid command.\"\n```\n\nDoes the \"while True\" statement mean that the loop will continue as long as the variable 'hand' is being assigned a value? What would happen if the variable 'hand' is not being assigned a value?"

        "content": "The `while True` statement in Python is a way to create an infinite loop. This loop will continue to execute indefinitely until it is explicitly broken out of using a `break` statement or when the program is terminated by some other means.\n\nHere's what happens in your code:\n\n1. The `while True` loop creates a loop that will run indefinitely.\n2. Inside the loop, the program waits for user input with `raw_input`.\n3. Depending on the user's input:\n   - If the user enters `'n'`, the program deals a new hand and plays it.\n   - If the user enters `'r'`, the program replays the last hand.\n   - If the user enters `'e'`, the `break` statement is executed, which exits the loop and ends the game.\n   - If the user enters anything else, the program prints \"Invalid command\" and the loop continues.\n\nThe `while True` loop does not depend on the value of the `hand` variable or any other condition. It will keep running until the `break` statement is reached. The value assigned to `hand` does not affect the continuation of the loop.\n\nIf you want the loop to stop based on a condition, you would use a `while` loop with a specific condition, like `while some_condition:`. But in this case, the loop is intended to continue until the user decides to end the game by entering `'e'`."
