I am currently getting many of these warnings when running unit tests due to the use of third-party libraries. The specific warning is as follows:\n\n```\nblock_io-python/block_io/__init__.py:182: ResourceWarning: unclosed <ssl.SSLSocket fd=11, family=AddressFamily.AF_INET, type=SocketType.SOCK_STREAM, proto=6, laddr=('x', 58395), raddr=('x, 443)>\n```\n\nI tried to disable these warnings using the following code, but it didn't have any effect:\n\n```python\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=ResourceWarning)\n```\nThis code was run during the unit test import time. Is there a way to ignore these warnings for the duration of the test run?"

        "content": "In Python 3.2, the `ResourceWarning` is a subclass of `Warning` that is used to signal potential resource leaks, such as unclosed files or sockets. Disabling these warnings can be useful when dealing with third-party libraries that may not handle resources properly. Here are a few ways you can handle or suppress these warnings:\n\n1. **Disable Warnings Globally at Runtime:**\n   You can use the `PYTHONWARNINGS` environment variable to suppress `ResourceWarning` throughout your entire application. Set this environment variable before running your Python script:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PYTHONWARNINGS=\"ignore::ResourceWarning\"\n   ```\n\n   Or, if you're using Windows:\n\n   ```cmd\n   set PYTHONWARNINGS=ignore::ResourceWarning\n   ```\n\n2. **Modify the `warnings` Module Configuration:**\n   Ensure that your `warnings.filterwarnings` call is placed as early as possible in your script, ideally before any imports that might trigger the warning:\n\n   ```python\n   import warnings\n\n   warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=ResourceWarning)\n\n   # Your imports and code here\n   ```\n\n3. **Use a Context Manager to Temporarily Suppress Warnings:**\n   If you want to suppress warnings only during certain parts of your code, you can use a context manager:\n\n   ```python\n   import warnings\n\n   with warnings.catch_warnings():\n       warnings.simplefilter(\"ignore\", ResourceWarning)\n       # Code that triggers the warnings\n\n   # Warnings are active again after exiting the block\n   ```\n\n4. **Explicitly Close Resources:**\n   If possible, review the third-party library code or your own code paths to ensure that all resources are being properly closed. This is a more sustainable and recommended approach, although it might not be feasible if the code is in a third-party library.\n\nBy using one of these methods, you should be able to suppress the `ResourceWarning` messages during your unit test runs. Keep in mind that suppressing warnings should be done cautiously, as they can be indicative of actual resource management issues in your code."
