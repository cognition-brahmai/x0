        "content": "The error message you're encountering, `TypeError: '(slice(None, None, None), 0)' is an invalid key`, suggests that the way you are trying to index or slice `X` is incorrect. This is likely because `X` is not in the expected format, such as a NumPy array or a similar data structure that supports such slicing.\n\nHere's what you can do to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check the Data Type of `X`:**\n   Make sure `X` is a NumPy array or a Pandas DataFrame. If it's a DataFrame, you should convert it to a NumPy array before trying to slice it:\n\n   ```python\n   import numpy as np\n\n   if isinstance(X, pd.DataFrame):\n       X = X.values\n   ```\n\n2. **Check the Dimensions of `X`:**\n   Ensure that `X` has at least two columns since you're trying to access `X[:, 0]` and `X[:, 1]`. You can do this using:\n\n   ```python\n   print(X.shape)\n   ```\n\n   Verify that the output has at least two columns.\n\n3. **Ensure Correct Data Splitting:**\n   Make sure `X_train` and `y_train` are correctly defined and are subsets of `X` and `y` respectively. If you have used a function like `train_test_split`, ensure that it's properly executed.\n\n4. **Reinitialize or Correct Variable Names:**\n   If `X` is supposed to be `X_train` in the lines where the error occurs, update it accordingly:\n\n   ```python\n   x_min, x_max = X_train[:, 0].min() - 1, X_train[:, 0].max() + 1\n   y_min, y_max = X_train[:, 1].min() - 1, X_train[:, 1].max() + 1\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify Variable Initialization:**\n   Ensure that all variables, like `X` and `y`, are initialized before they are used. If they come from a previous part of your code, ensure they have been set correctly.\n\nBy checking these points, you should be able to identify and fix the issue. Once the data is correctly structured, the slicing should work, and your decision boundary plot should be generated without errors."
