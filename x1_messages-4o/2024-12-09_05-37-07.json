After installing the Requests module via `easy_install`, I attempted to execute the demo code from this tutorial, which is as follows:\n\n```python\nimport requests\npayload = {'username': 'xxxx', 'password': 'xxxxx'}\nr = requests.get('https://github.com/timeline.json')\n```\n\nHowever, I am encountering an `AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'get'`. Could you help me solve this problem?"

        "content": "The error message you're encountering suggests that there might be an issue with how the `requests` module is being imported or used. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Proper Installation:**\n   Make sure that the `requests` module is properly installed. Instead of using `easy_install`, consider using `pip`, which is the recommended package manager for Python. You can install the `requests` module with the following command:\n   ```bash\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n\n2. **Check for File Name Conflicts:**\n   Ensure that the file you're running your script from is not named `requests.py`. If it is, Python might be trying to import your script as the module instead of the actual `requests` library, leading to the `AttributeError`. Rename your script file if necessary.\n\n3. **Check for Other Conflicts:**\n   Make sure there isn't another file or directory named `requests` in your working directory or in the Python path that could be causing a conflict.\n\n4. **Verify Import:**\n   Double-check your import statement to ensure it's correctly written:\n   ```python\n   import requests\n   ```\n\n5. **Test Import in Python Shell:**\n   Open a Python shell and try importing the `requests` module to see if it imports without errors:\n   ```python\n   >>> import requests\n   >>> print(requests.__version__)\n   ```\n   If this works without issue, the problem is likely specific to your script or environment.\n\n6. **Check Python Environment:**\n   If you're using a virtual environment, make sure it is activated. The `requests` module should be installed in the active environment.\n\n7. **Reinstall Requests:**\n   If none of the above steps work, try uninstalling and reinstalling the `requests` module:\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall requests\n   pip install requests\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `AttributeError` and use the `requests` module as expected."
