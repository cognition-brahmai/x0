Here is an example of how you might modify the Python code to accomplish this:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# List of activities\nactivities = [\n    {\"name\": \"Read a book\", \"type\": \"mental\", \"indoor\": True},\n    {\"name\": \"Solve a puzzle\", \"type\": \"mental\", \"indoor\": True},\n    {\"name\": \"Play chess\", \"type\": \"mental\", \"indoor\": True},\n    {\"name\": \"Yoga\", \"type\": \"physical\", \"indoor\": True},\n    {\"name\": \"Meditation\", \"type\": \"mental\", \"indoor\": True},\n    {\"name\": \"Write a story\", \"type\": \"mental\", \"indoor\": True},\n    {\"name\": \"Dance\", \"type\": \"physical\", \"indoor\": True},\n    {\"name\": \"Home workout\", \"type\": \"physical\", \"indoor\": True},\n    {\"name\": \"Cook a new recipe\", \"type\": \"mental\", \"indoor\": True},\n    {\"name\": \"Paint or draw\", \"type\": \"mental\", \"indoor\": True},\n    {\"name\": \"Learn a new language\", \"type\": \"mental\", \"indoor\": True},\n    {\"name\": \"Play video games\", \"type\": \"mental\", \"indoor\": True},\n    {\"name\": \"Jigsaw puzzle\", \"type\": \"mental\", \"indoor\": True},\n]\n\ndef select_activities(activities):\n    # Filter activities that can be done indoors\n    indoor_activities = [activity for activity in activities if activity[\"indoor\"]]\n\n    # Separate activities by type\n    mental_activities = [activity for activity in indoor_activities if activity[\"type\"] == \"mental\"]\n    physical_activities = [activity for activity in indoor_activities if activity[\"type\"] == \"physical\"]\n\n    # Ensure at least two mentally stimulating activities\n    selected_mental = random.sample(mental_activities, 2)\n\n    # Ensure at least one physical exercise activity\n    selected_physical = random.sample(physical_activities, 1)\n\n    # Combine selected activities\n    selected_activities = selected_mental + selected_physical\n\n    # Print selected activities without repeating any activity\n    for activity in selected_activities:\n        print(activity[\"name\"])\n\n# Call the function to select and print activities\nselect_activities(activities)\n```\n\nThis code will randomly select two mentally stimulating indoor activities and one physical exercise activity from the given list, ensuring no activity is repeated in the output. The `random.sample` function is used to randomly choose activities from the filtered lists."
