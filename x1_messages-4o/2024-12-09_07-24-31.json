        "content": "The `SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing` typically indicates that Python reached the end of the file without finding a complete construct. In your case, it suggests that the loops are not properly closed, most likely due to missing code blocks. Let's address the issues in your code:\n\n1. Ensure that your loops have their intended content inside them. It seems like you started a `for` loop but didn't provide the body of the loop. Every `for` loop should have an indented block of code following it.\n\n2. The indentation of the `for` loop starting with `for i in range(0, 24):` appears incorrect due to an extra space at the beginning. It should be aligned with the rest of the code.\n\n3. You need to ensure that all loops have their necessary logic inside them. Here's a corrected version of the code with proper indentation and added logic placeholders:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Read the CSV file\nelec_and_weather = pd.read_csv(r'C:\\HOUR.csv', parse_dates=True, index_col=0)\n\n# Add historic DEMAND to each X vector\nfor i in range(0, 24):\n    elec_and_weather[i] = np.zeros(len(elec_and_weather['DEMAND']))\n    elec_and_weather[i][elec_and_weather.index.hour == i] = 1\n\n# Set number of hours prediction is in advance\nn_hours_advance = 24\n\n# Set number of historic hours used\nn_hours_window = 24\n\nfor k in range(n_hours_advance, n_hours_advance + n_hours_window):\n    elec_and_weather['DEMAND_t-%i' % k] = np.zeros(len(elec_and_weather['DEMAND']))\n\n# Continue with the rest of your logic here\n```\n\nMake sure that any additional logic that should follow the loops is properly indented and placed inside the loops if necessary. If you have more operations to perform within these loops, ensure they are included and properly indented.\n\nIf you have further code that was omitted, be sure to include it after the loops to ensure that the script is complete and functions as intended."
