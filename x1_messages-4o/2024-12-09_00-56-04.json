I followed these steps for installation:\n\n1. Installed miniconda (armv7 distribution)\n2. Installed all Theano dependencies through Conda (if possible), pip and apt-get\n3. Installed Theano\n4. Installed Keras\n\nDespite this, when I try to load a model using the following script:\n\n```python\nfrom keras.models import load_model\nmodel = load_model('model.hdf5')\n```\n\nI encounter a \"Segmentation fault (core dumped)\" error. Upon further investigation using gdb python and running 'test.py', I receive a Segmentation fault at 0x76fd9822 in ?? () from /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3. Using 'backtrace' in the gdb shell, I am presented with:\n\n```python\n#0  0x76fd9822 in ?? () from /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3\n#1  0x76fd983a in ?? () from /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3\n```\n\nI also tried using TensorFlow as an alternative but encountered the same issue. Further investigation revealed an error in numpy, particularly in libopenblas.so.0. I have installed everything without using Miniconda and Keras works now with TensorFlow, but not with Theano yet. How can I fix this issue and get Keras + Theano to run on a Raspberry Pi?"

        "content": "Running Theano with Keras on a Raspberry Pi can be challenging due to hardware limitations and compatibility issues. Here's a step-by-step guide to help resolve the segmentation fault and get Keras with Theano working on your Raspberry Pi:\n\n1. **Check OpenBLAS Configuration**: Since the issue seems to be related to `libopenblas.so.0`, ensure that OpenBLAS is properly configured. You can try setting the number of threads to 1, which can help avoid threading-related segmentation faults:\n\n   ```bash\n   export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1\n   ```\n\n   Add this line to your `.bashrc` or `.profile` to make it persistent across sessions.\n\n2. **Reinstall Numpy and OpenBLAS**: Sometimes, the issue might be with a corrupted or incompatible installation. Try reinstalling Numpy and OpenBLAS:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall numpy\n   sudo apt-get remove --purge libopenblas-dev\n   sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev\n   pip install numpy\n   ```\n\n3. **Use a Virtual Environment**: Create a new virtual environment and install Theano, Keras, and their dependencies within it to avoid conflicts:\n\n   ```bash\n   conda create -n keras_theano_env python=3.7\n   conda activate keras_theano_env\n   conda install theano keras\n   ```\n\n4. **Compile Theano with Debugging**: Enable Theano's debugging mode to get more informative error messages:\n\n   Edit your `.theanorc` file (create it in your home directory if it doesn't exist) and add:\n\n   ```ini\n   [global]\n   device = cpu\n   floatX = float32\n   \n   [blas]\n   ldflags = -lblas -lopenblas\n   \n   [gcc]\n   cxxflags = -march=armv7-a\n   ```\n\n5. **Check for System Updates**: Ensure your system packages are up to date:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get upgrade\n   ```\n\n6. **Test with a Simple Script**: Before loading a complex model, test Theano with a simple script to ensure it runs without errors:\n\n   ```python\n   import theano\n   from theano import tensor as T\n\n   x = T.dscalar('x')\n   y = T.dscalar('y')\n   z = x + y\n   f = theano.function([x, y], z)\n\n   print(f(2, 3))  # Expected output: 5.0\n   ```\n\n7. **Check for Specific ARM Architecture Issues**: Raspberry Pi's ARM architecture might have specific quirks. Ensure that your Python and all libraries are compatible with ARM. Sometimes, building libraries from source with specific flags can resolve these issues.\n\n8. **Try Alternative Installations**: If the problem persists, consider using community-supported distributions that are optimized for Raspberry Pi, such as those found in the Raspberry Pi forums or GitHub repositories.\n\n9. **Consult Community Forums**: Raspberry Pi and Theano community forums can be helpful. There might be others who have faced similar issues and found solutions specific to the Raspberry Pi architecture.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to troubleshoot and resolve the segmentation fault issue when running Keras with Theano on a Raspberry Pi."
