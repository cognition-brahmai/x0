I have a code that outputs an observation like '[-0.061586 -0.75893141 0.05793238 1.15547541]'. Can you explain what these numbers mean? Also, how can I know the specifications of other Environments such as 'MountainCar-v0', 'MsPacman-v0' and so on? I have looked through the documentation at 'https://github.com/openai/gym' but I couldn't find the information. My code and its output are as follows:\n```python\nimport gym\nenv = gym.make('CartPole-v0')\nfor i_episode in range(20):\n    observation = env.reset()\n    for t in range(100):\n        env.render()\n        print(observation)\n        action = env.action_space.sample()\n        observation, reward, done, info = env.step(action)\n        if done:\n            print(\"Episode finished after {} timesteps\".format(t+1))\n            break\n```\nOutput:\n```python\n[-0.061586   -0.75893141  0.05793238  1.15547541]\n[-0.07676463 -0.95475889  0.08104189  1.46574644]\n[-0.0958598  -1.15077434  0.11035682  1.78260485]\n[-0.11887529 -0.95705275  0.14600892  1.5261692 ]\n[-0.13801635 -0.7639636   0.1765323   1.28239155]\n[-0.15329562 -0.57147373  0.20218013  1.04977545]\nEpisode finished after 14 timesteps\n[-0.02786724  0.00361763 -0.03938967 -0.01611184]\n[-0.02779488 -0.19091794 -0.03971191  0.26388759]\n[-0.03161324  0.00474768 -0.03443415 -0.04105167]\n```"

        "content": "The observation in 'CartPole-v0' from OpenAI Gym is represented by a four-element array, where each element corresponds to a specific physical property of the environment's current state. Here's what each element represents:\n\n1. **Cart Position**: The position of the cart along the horizontal axis.\n2. **Cart Velocity**: The velocity of the cart along the horizontal axis.\n3. **Pole Angle**: The angle of the pole with respect to the vertical direction.\n4. **Pole Angular Velocity**: The angular velocity of the pole.\n\nIn the example output you provided, `[-0.061586, -0.75893141, 0.05793238, 1.15547541]`, the values represent the cart's position, velocity, pole angle, and angular velocity, respectively. These values help in determining the current state of the environment and are used to decide the actions to be taken (e.g., moving the cart left or right).\n\nTo find the specifications of other environments such as 'MountainCar-v0', 'MsPacman-v0', and so on, you can refer to the source code of each environment within the Gym library. The environment specifications are typically defined in the environment's Python file. You can also consult the Gym documentation and the community forums for detailed descriptions and examples.\n\nHere's a brief overview of what these environments usually include:\n\n- **MountainCar-v0**:\n  - **Observation Space**: A two-element array representing the position and velocity of the car.\n  - **Action Space**: Discrete actions to accelerate left, do nothing, or accelerate right.\n\n- **MsPacman-v0**:\n  - **Observation Space**: An array representing the pixel values of the game screen.\n  - **Action Space**: Discrete actions corresponding to directions (up, down, left, right) and other game-specific actions.\n\nFor the most accurate and detailed understanding, examining the source code and any accompanying documentation in the Gym repository would be beneficial. If you have specific questions about any environment, feel free to ask!"
