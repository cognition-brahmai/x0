        "content": "In Python 2.6, the `print` statement is a special syntax, while in Python 3, `print` is a function. To ease the transition from Python 2 to Python 3, Python 2.6 introduced the `__future__` module, which allows you to import certain Python 3 features into Python 2.6 code.\n\nWhen you use the command `from __future__ import print_function`, it enables the use of the Python 3 `print()` function syntax in Python 2.6. This means you can use `print()` as a function, allowing for more consistent and flexible printing capabilities, such as specifying the separator, end character, and directing the output to a different stream.\n\nThe reason you import `print_function` and not just `print` is because `print` was not a function in Python 2, but rather a statement. The `__future__` import allows you to use the new function-based syntax while maintaining backward compatibility with Python 2 code. Moreover, `from __future__ import print` would be syntactically incorrect because `print` is not an importable function or module; it's a keyword in Python 2.\n\nAs for why you use `print()` instead of `print_function()`, it is because the `__future__` import modifies the behavior of the existing `print` keyword to act like the Python 3 `print()` function. It doesn't introduce a new function named `print_function`; it simply changes how `print` works in your code. Therefore, you continue to use `print()`, but with the new functionality."
