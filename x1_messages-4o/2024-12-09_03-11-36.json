When I select Python 2.7 using the command `$ port select python python27`, virtualenvwrapper works perfectly. However, when I select another version of Python, for instance, 2.6, virtualenvwrapper generates an error message: `ImportError: No module named virtualenvwrapper.hook_loader`. In my .profile, `VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON` is set to `/opt/local/bin/python`, so I believe virtualenvwrapper should work regardless of the Python version I've selected. Can anyone explain why virtualenvwrapper generates a .hook_loader error when I switch Python versions?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with virtualenvwrapper is likely related to how the Python environment is set up and how virtualenvwrapper is configured for each Python version. Here are a few things to consider:\n\n1. **Virtualenvwrapper Installation**: Virtualenvwrapper is a Python module that needs to be installed for each version of Python you are using. If you switch to Python 2.6, ensure that virtualenvwrapper is installed for that version. You can do this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   /opt/local/bin/python2.6 -m pip install virtualenvwrapper\n   ```\n\n   This command installs virtualenvwrapper specifically for the Python 2.6 version.\n\n2. **PYTHONPATH and Path Configuration**: Ensure that your PYTHONPATH is correctly set up to include the directories where virtualenvwrapper and its dependencies are installed. Check your `.profile` or `.bashrc` to ensure that the path configurations are correct for the selected Python version.\n\n3. **Virtualenv Location**: Make sure that the virtualenv executable used by virtualenvwrapper is compatible with the Python version you are selecting. You can specify the virtualenv to use by setting the `VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_VIRTUALENV` variable in your `.profile`:\n\n   ```bash\n   export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_VIRTUALENV=/opt/local/bin/virtualenv-2.6\n   ```\n\n   Adjust the path based on where the virtualenv for Python 2.6 is installed.\n\n4. **Check for Conflicting Installations**: Sometimes, having multiple installations of Python or pip can cause conflicts. Make sure that when you switch to Python 2.6, the corresponding pip is used to install packages. You can verify this by running:\n\n   ```bash\n   /opt/local/bin/python2.6 -m pip --version\n   ```\n\n5. **Updating Virtualenvwrapper**: Ensure that you're using the latest version of virtualenvwrapper, as older versions might have compatibility issues with certain Python versions.\n\n6. **Debugging**: You can also add debugging information to your shell configuration to help diagnose the issue:\n\n   ```bash\n   export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_LOG_DIR=~/.virtualenvwrapper/logs\n   ```\n\n   This will create logs that might provide more insight into what is going wrong when you attempt to use virtualenvwrapper with Python 2.6.\n\nBy ensuring that virtualenvwrapper is installed for each version of Python you are using and by adjusting your configuration files accordingly, you should be able to resolve the ImportError you're encountering."
