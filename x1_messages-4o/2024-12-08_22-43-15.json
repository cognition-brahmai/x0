However, I can certainly give it a try using these words. Here's a Python program that generates a simple limerick using one of the provided rhyming words:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef generate_limerick():\n    # List of words that rhyme with \"orange\"\n    rhyming_words = [\"sporange\", \"door-hinge\", \"Blorenge\", \"Binge\", \"inge\", \"poringe\"]\n\n    # Select a random word from the list\n    selected_word = random.choice(rhyming_words)\n\n    # Define a limerick structure\n    limerick = [\n        f\"There once was a man from {selected_word},\",\n        \"Whose habits were quite a strange binge.\",\n        \"He would dance on a ledge,\",\n        \"With a smile as his pledge,\",\n        f\"And sing songs that he wrote in his {selected_word}.\"\n    ]\n\n    # Output the limerick to the console\n    for line in limerick:\n        print(line)\n\n# Generate the limerick\ngenerate_limerick()\n```\n\nThis program randomly selects a word from the list and constructs a simple limerick around it. Keep in mind that the words provided aren't perfect rhymes, so the limerick is more playful and creative rather than strictly adhering to traditional rhyming schemes."
