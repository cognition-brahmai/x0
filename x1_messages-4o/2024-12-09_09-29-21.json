        "content": "Certainly! The problem you're dealing with is a classic one in computer science known as the \"Maximum Subarray Problem.\" The most efficient solution to this problem is Kadane's Algorithm, which runs in O(n) time complexity. Here\u2019s how it works:\n\n### Kadane's Algorithm\n\n1. **Initialize Variables**:\n   - `max_current` to the first element of the array. This keeps track of the maximum sum of the subarray ending at the current position.\n   - `max_global` to the same value as `max_current`. This keeps track of the overall maximum sum encountered so far.\n\n2. **Iterate through the Array**:\n   - For each element in the array (starting from the second element), update `max_current` to be the maximum of the current element itself and `max_current` plus the current element. This step decides whether to start a new subarray or to continue the existing one.\n   - Update `max_global` to be the maximum of `max_global` and `max_current`. This step ensures that `max_global` always holds the highest sum encountered.\n\n3. **Return Result**:\n   - After iterating through the array, `max_global` will contain the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.\n\n### Pseudocode\n\n```plaintext\nfunction kadaneAlgorithm(array):\n    max_current = array[0]\n    max_global = array[0]\n\n    for i from 1 to length(array) - 1:\n        max_current = max(array[i], max_current + array[i])\n        if max_current > max_global:\n            max_global = max_current\n\n    return max_global\n```\n\n### Example\n\nConsider the array `[-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]`.\n\n- Start with `max_current = -2` and `max_global = -2`.\n- As you iterate through the array:\n  - Update `max_current` and `max_global` accordingly.\n  - By the end of the iteration, `max_global` will be `6`, which is the sum of the subarray `[4, -1, 2, 1]`.\n\nThis algorithm efficiently finds the maximum sum subarray with a linear time complexity, making it suitable for large arrays."
