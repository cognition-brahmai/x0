The location is represented by a tuple with the room name and the direction from the entrance. For example, the hash may look like this:\nitems = {\n  \"spoon\": [\"kitchen\", \"on the counter\"],\n  \"book\": [\"living room\", \"on the coffee table\"],\n  \"pen\": [\"bedroom\", \"on the desk\"]\n}\nThe code should prompt the user to enter the name of an item they are looking for and return the location of that item if it is in the hash. If the item is not found, the program should inform the user that the item is not in the room. How can I achieve this in Ruby? Please provide the code."

        "content": "To create a Ruby program that searches for specific items in a room represented by a hash, you can follow the steps below. The program will prompt the user to enter the name of an item they are looking for and then return its location if it is found in the hash. Otherwise, it will inform the user that the item is not in the room.\n\nHere's a sample implementation:\n\n```ruby\n# Define a hash with items and their locations\nitems = {\n  \"spoon\" => [\"kitchen\", \"on the counter\"],\n  \"book\" => [\"living room\", \"on the coffee table\"],\n  \"pen\" => [\"bedroom\", \"on the desk\"]\n}\n\n# Prompt the user to enter the name of the item they are looking for\nputs \"Enter the name of the item you are looking for:\"\nitem_name = gets.chomp\n\n# Search for the item in the hash\nif items.key?(item_name)\n  location = items[item_name]\n  puts \"The #{item_name} is located in the #{location[0]}, #{location[1]}.\"\nelse\n  puts \"The item '#{item_name}' is not in the room.\"\nend\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Hash Definition**: We define a hash named `items` where keys are item names and values are arrays containing the room name and the location description.\n\n2. **User Input**: We prompt the user to enter the name of the item they are looking for using `gets.chomp`, which reads the input and removes any trailing newline character.\n\n3. **Search Logic**: We use the `key?` method to check if the entered item name exists in the hash.\n\n4. **Output**: If the item is found, we retrieve its location and print a message with the location details. If not, we inform the user that the item is not in the room.\n\nThis simple program will help you search for items based on user input in a predefined hash structure."
