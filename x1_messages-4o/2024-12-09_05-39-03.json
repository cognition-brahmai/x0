I want the box plot of every column of the dataframe to be plotted on the same figure, with the x-axis containing the column's names. In seaborn, I would like this to be equivalent to grouping by every column. I have tried using `sns.boxplot(df)`, but it only gives me one grouped boxplot. How can I reproduce the same figure I get in pandas using seaborn? Here is what I have done in pandas:\n\n```python\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data = np.random.random(size=(4,4)), columns = ['A','B','C','D'])\ndf.boxplot()\n```\n\nThis is the figure I get:\n[Image](https://i.stack.imgur.com/6NHvp.png)"

        "content": "To generate a boxplot of multiple columns from a Pandas DataFrame on the same figure using Seaborn, you can melt the DataFrame into a long format and then use Seaborn's `boxplot` function. Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Create a DataFrame with random data\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data=np.random.random(size=(4, 4)), columns=['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'])\n\n# Melt the DataFrame to long format\ndf_melted = df.melt(var_name='Variable', value_name='Value')\n\n# Create the boxplot\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\nsns.boxplot(x='Variable', y='Value', data=df_melted)\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.title('Boxplot of Multiple Columns')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Melting the DataFrame**: The `melt` function transforms the DataFrame from a wide format to a long format, which is suitable for plotting with Seaborn. Each column becomes a category in a single column, and the corresponding values are stacked in another column.\n\n2. **Seaborn Boxplot**: By specifying `x='Variable'` and `y='Value'`, Seaborn plots each original column as a separate category on the x-axis, with its corresponding values used to create the boxplots.\n\n3. **Visualization**: This approach allows you to visualize each column's distribution side by side on the same figure, similar to what Pandas' `boxplot` method does."
