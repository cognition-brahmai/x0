For example, I want to define two functions with the same name, but decorated with different decorators for Linux and Windows. I want the definition to be used based on the OS and the other one to be ignored. It's not about determining the OS, but about function definition and decorators. The code I am trying to implement is as follows:\n\n```python\n@linux\ndef my_callback(*args, **kwargs):\n    print(\"Doing something @ Linux\")\n    return\n\n@windows\ndef my_callback(*args, **kwargs):\n    print(\"Doing something @ Windows\")\n    return\n```"

        "content": "Yes, you can define functions conditionally based on the operating system by using Python's built-in `platform` module to determine the current OS and then define the function accordingly. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n1. Import the `platform` module to check the OS.\n2. Use an `if` statement to conditionally define the function with the appropriate decorator based on the OS.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n\n```python\nimport platform\n\n# Define dummy decorators for demonstration\ndef linux(func):\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        print(\"Linux decorator applied\")\n        return func(*args, **kwargs)\n    return wrapper\n\ndef windows(func):\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        print(\"Windows decorator applied\")\n        return func(*args, **kwargs)\n    return wrapper\n\n# Check the OS and define the function accordingly\nif platform.system() == \"Linux\":\n    @linux\n    def my_callback(*args, **kwargs):\n        print(\"Doing something @ Linux\")\nelse:\n    @windows\n    def my_callback(*args, **kwargs):\n        print(\"Doing something @ Windows\")\n\n# Example usage\nmy_callback()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Dummy Decorators**: `linux` and `windows` are simple decorators used here to demonstrate the concept. You can replace them with your actual decorators.\n  \n- **Platform Check**: The `platform.system()` function returns the name of the operating system. You can use it to determine if the current OS is \"Linux\" or \"Windows\" and define the function accordingly.\n\n- **Conditional Definition**: The `if` statement is used to select the appropriate function definition based on the OS, ensuring that only one version of `my_callback` is defined and used.\n\nThis approach ensures that only the function with the correct decorator for the current OS is defined, while the other one is ignored."
