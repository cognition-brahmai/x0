        "content": "I have encountered an issue while working with CUDA where the first call to `cudaMalloc` is extremely slow, which seems to be a bug in the CUDA drivers. Moreover, I have noticed that the runtime of `cudaMalloc` is directly linked to the number of 3rd-party CUDA libraries I have linked to my program, even though I don't use these libraries. I tested this with a simple program and found that the more libraries I linked, the longer the running time. According to 'gdb', the time is indeed going into my `cudaMalloc`, so it's not caused by some library initialization routine. Can anyone provide a plausible explanation for this?\n\nHere is the code I used for testing:\n\n```c\nint main() {\n  cudaSetDevice(0);\n  unsigned int *ptr = 0;\n  cudaMalloc((void **)&ptr, 2000000 * sizeof(unsigned int));   \n  cudaFree(ptr);\nreturn 1;\n}\n```\n\nAnd here are the results:\n\n- Linked with: -lcudart -lnpp -lcufft -lcublas -lcusparse -lcurand \n     running time: 5.852449\n- Linked with: -lcudart -lnpp -lcufft -lcublas  running time: 1.425120\n- Linked with: -lcudart -lnpp -lcufft running time: 0.905424\n- Linked with: -lcudart  running time: 0.394558"

        "content": "The phenomenon you're encountering with `cudaMalloc` being slow on the first call, especially when linked with multiple CUDA libraries, is a known behavior and can be attributed to a few possible reasons:\n\n1. **Driver and Runtime Initialization**: The first call to a CUDA API function in your application typically triggers the initialization of the CUDA driver and runtime. This involves loading the necessary GPU drivers and libraries, which can be time-consuming. When you link more CUDA libraries, even if they are not directly used, they might contribute to the initialization overhead.\n\n2. **Library Initialization**: Each additional library linked to your program may have its own initialization routines that are triggered when the CUDA runtime is initialized. This can cause an increase in the time taken for the first CUDA call.\n\n3. **GPU Context Creation**: The first CUDA call also involves creating a context on the GPU, which includes allocating device memory for internal data structures, setting up the CUDA driver, and establishing the communication channel between the host and the device. More linked libraries could mean more dependencies to resolve during this context creation.\n\n4. **Symbol Resolution and Linking**: When your program is linked with multiple libraries, the dynamic linker has more symbols to resolve and link at runtime. This can increase the startup time as the linker has to process these additional libraries.\n\n5. **Lazy Loading of Libraries**: Some systems use lazy loading, where the dynamic linker does not load a library until a function from that library is called. The presence of multiple libraries can affect this process, adding to the overhead during the first CUDA call.\n\nTo mitigate this issue, you might consider the following strategies:\n\n- **Minimize Linked Libraries**: Only link the libraries that are necessary for your application to reduce the initialization overhead.\n- **Separate Initialization**: If possible, separate the initialization phase from the main execution phase of your program. This allows you to perform the initialization (and incur the overhead) during a non-critical part of your application.\n- **Profiling**: Use tools like NVIDIA Nsight Systems or nvprof to gain insights into where the time is being spent during the initialization phase.\n- **Driver and Library Updates**: Ensure that you are using the latest versions of the CUDA toolkit and drivers, as performance improvements and bug fixes are regularly implemented.\n\nUnderstanding and managing initialization overhead is a common challenge when working with high-performance computing libraries and can vary depending on the hardware, driver version, and specifics of the system configuration."
