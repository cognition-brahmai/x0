Convolutional layers are fundamental components of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are extensively used for image and video processing tasks. These layers involve a large number of operations, such as convolutional operations and backpropagation, which are computationally intensive and benefit significantly from the parallel processing capabilities of GPUs or TPUs."
