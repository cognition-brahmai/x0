My code looks like this:\n\n```python\nactual = b_manager.get_b(complete_set)\nassert actual is not None\nassert actual.columns == ['bl', 'direction', 'day']\n```\n\nThe first assertion works fine, but the second one gives me a ValueError: \n\n```python\nValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()\n```\n\nI'm assuming that this is not the correct way to assert the equality of two different lists with pytest. Can anyone guide me on how I can assert that the dataframe columns (a list) is equal to the expected one?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is because the list of columns you're comparing might be a NumPy array or a Pandas Index, and direct equality checks like `==` can lead to ambiguous truth values in such cases. \n\nTo properly assert equality between lists or arrays in pytest, you can use more suitable methods like `assert list1 == list2` when both are Python lists, or use specific methods provided by libraries like Pandas. Here's how you can adjust your code to avoid the error:\n\n1. **Convert to List**: If `actual.columns` is a Pandas Index, you can convert it to a list and then compare:\n\n   ```python\n   assert list(actual.columns) == ['bl', 'direction', 'day']\n   ```\n\n2. **Use `pd.Index.equals` method**: If you want to keep it within Pandas, use the `.equals` method to compare Index objects:\n\n   ```python\n   assert actual.columns.equals(pd.Index(['bl', 'direction', 'day']))\n   ```\n\nBoth approaches should resolve the `ValueError` and provide a clear assertion of whether the DataFrame's columns match the expected list. Choose the one that best suits your coding style or specific requirements."
