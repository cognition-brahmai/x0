How can I convert a map object to a numpy array in Python 3? I tried converting `seq` to a list first as suggested by @jonrsharpe:\n\n```python\nseq = np.array(list(seq))\n```\nbut I would prefer to avoid the extra call to `list`. How can I achieve this?"

        "content": "In Python 3, the `map` function returns an iterator, which is why you're seeing a map object instead of the expected array. To convert the map object to a numpy array, you indeed need to first convert it to a list or some other iterable that can be consumed by `np.array`. While Python 3 emphasizes using iterators for efficiency, if you want to avoid explicitly converting to a list but still achieve the same result, there's no direct way to bypass the creation of an intermediate iterable.\n\nHowever, you can use `np.fromiter`, which is specifically designed to create arrays from an iterable and allows you to specify the data type:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nf = lambda x: x**2\nseq = map(f, range(5))\nseq = np.fromiter(seq, dtype=int)\nprint(seq)\n# prints: [ 0  1  4  9 16]\n```\n\nIn this code, `np.fromiter` takes the map object and the data type (`dtype=int`) as parameters to create a numpy array directly from the iterator. This method avoids creating a list and should be more memory efficient for large sequences."
