        "content": "Creating a deck of cards using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python is a great way to practice your understanding of classes and objects. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Define the Card Class**: This class will represent a single card in the deck. It should have attributes for suit and rank.\n\n2. **Define the Deck Class**: This class will represent the entire deck of cards, typically consisting of 52 cards. It should include methods to shuffle the deck, draw a card, etc.\n\nHere's a simple implementation:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# Define the Card class\nclass Card:\n    def __init__(self, suit, rank):\n        self.suit = suit\n        self.rank = rank\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"{self.rank} of {self.suit}\"\n\n# Define the Deck class\nclass Deck:\n    suits = ['Hearts', 'Diamonds', 'Clubs', 'Spades']\n    ranks = ['2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', 'Jack', 'Queen', 'King', 'Ace']\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.cards = [Card(suit, rank) for suit in Deck.suits for rank in Deck.ranks]\n\n    def shuffle(self):\n        random.shuffle(self.cards)\n\n    def draw_card(self):\n        return self.cards.pop() if self.cards else None\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return '\\n'.join(str(card) for card in self.cards)\n\n# Example usage\ndeck = Deck()\nprint(\"Initial deck:\")\nprint(deck)\n\ndeck.shuffle()\nprint(\"\\nShuffled deck:\")\nprint(deck)\n\ncard = deck.draw_card()\nprint(f\"\\nDrawn card: {card}\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n\n- **Card Class**: Represents a single card with a suit and rank. The `__str__` method provides a human-readable representation of the card.\n\n- **Deck Class**: Initializes a standard deck of 52 cards using list comprehension. The `shuffle` method randomizes the order of cards, and the `draw_card` method removes and returns the top card from the deck.\n\nThis code will print the initial ordered deck, shuffle it, and then draw a card from the shuffled deck, demonstrating the basic functionalities of a deck of cards using OOP in Python."
