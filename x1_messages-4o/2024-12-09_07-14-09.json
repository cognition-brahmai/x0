When I run the following code in Python 2.7.3, I'm getting different results than expected. However, when I try this in Python 3.0, it throws an error. What's the reason behind this?\n\nHere's the code that I'm referring to:\n\n```python\n>>> 011\n9\n>>> 0100\n64\n>>> 027\n23\n```\n\nEven though these numbers are still being interpreted as integers:\n\n```python\n>>> type(027)\n<type 'int'>\n```"

        "content": "In Python 2, numbers that start with a `0` are interpreted as octal (base-8) numbers. This is why you're seeing unexpected results. Here's a breakdown of what's happening with each of your examples:\n\n1. `011` in octal is equivalent to `1*(8^1) + 1*(8^0)`, which is `8 + 1 = 9` in decimal.\n2. `0100` in octal is equivalent to `1*(8^2) + 0*(8^1) + 0*(8^0)`, which is `64` in decimal.\n3. `027` in octal is equivalent to `2*(8^1) + 7*(8^0)`, which is `16 + 7 = 23` in decimal.\n\nIn Python 3, the syntax for octal numbers has been changed to avoid this confusion. Octal numbers must be prefixed with `0o` or `0O`. If you try to use a leading `0` for octal representation in Python 3, it results in a syntax error, which is why you're seeing an error when running the same code in Python 3. \n\nTo avoid these issues and improve code readability, it is recommended to use the `0o` prefix for octal numbers in Python 3. Here's how you would write the same numbers in Python 3:\n\n```python\n>>> 0o11\n9\n>>> 0o100\n64\n>>> 0o27\n23\n```\n\nThis ensures that the numbers are correctly interpreted as octal and improves code clarity."
