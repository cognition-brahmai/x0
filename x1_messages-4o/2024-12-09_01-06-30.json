        "content": "To read and extract content from a PDF file in Python, there are several libraries you can use. Some of the most popular ones include:\n\n1. **PyPDF2**:\n   - It's a pure Python library for PDF manipulation.\n   - You can extract text, merge PDFs, split PDFs, and more.\n   - However, it might not handle complex PDF layouts well.\n\n   ```python\n   import PyPDF2\n\n   def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):\n       with open(pdf_path, 'rb') as file:\n           reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)\n           text = ''\n           for page in reader.pages:\n               text += page.extract_text()\n           return text\n\n   pdf_text = extract_text_from_pdf('example.pdf')\n   print(pdf_text)\n   ```\n\n2. **pdfminer.six**:\n   - It is more powerful and accurate than PyPDF2 for text extraction, especially for complex layouts.\n   - It provides detailed information about the text and its layout.\n\n   ```python\n   from pdfminer.high_level import extract_text\n\n   def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):\n       return extract_text(pdf_path)\n\n   pdf_text = extract_text_from_pdf('example.pdf')\n   print(pdf_text)\n   ```\n\n3. **PyMuPDF (fitz)**:\n   - Known for speed and efficiency.\n   - It can extract text, images, and other content from PDF files.\n\n   ```python\n   import fitz  # PyMuPDF\n\n   def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):\n       doc = fitz.open(pdf_path)\n       text = ''\n       for page in doc:\n           text += page.get_text()\n       return text\n\n   pdf_text = extract_text_from_pdf('example.pdf')\n   print(pdf_text)\n   ```\n\n4. **pytesseract** (in combination with PDF to image conversion):\n   - Useful for PDFs that are essentially scanned images.\n   - Requires Tesseract OCR to be installed.\n\n   ```python\n   from pdf2image import convert_from_path\n   import pytesseract\n\n   def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):\n       images = convert_from_path(pdf_path)\n       text = ''\n       for image in images:\n           text += pytesseract.image_to_string(image)\n       return text\n\n   pdf_text = extract_text_from_pdf('example.pdf')\n   print(pdf_text)\n   ```\n\nEach of these libraries has its strengths and weaknesses, so the best choice depends on your specific needs, such as handling complex layouts, speed, or dealing with scanned images. If you need a combination of features, you might end up using more than one library."
