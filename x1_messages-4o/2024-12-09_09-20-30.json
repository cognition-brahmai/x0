Here's a simple example of how you can do this:\n\n```javascript\nfor (let i = 10; i <= 20; i++) {\n    console.log(i);\n}\n```\n\nIn this loop:\n\n- `let i = 10` initializes the loop counter `i` to 10.\n- `i <= 20` sets the condition for the loop to continue running as long as `i` is less than or equal to 20.\n- `i++` increments the value of `i` by 1 after each iteration of the loop.\n- `console.log(i)` prints the current value of `i` to the console. \n\nThis will output the numbers 10 through 20 in the console, one number per line."
