The script prompts the user to enter a pay amount, which is appended to a list as an integer. The process continues until the user chooses not to. Afterward, I am trying to increment each integer in the list by 1000.\n\n```python\npayList = []\nnumElements = 0\n\nwhile True:\n        payValue = raw_input(\"Enter the pay amount: \")\n        numElements = numElements + 1\n        payList.append(payValue)\n        choice = raw_input(\"Do you wish to continue(y/n)?\")\n        if choice == 'n' or choice == 'N':\n                         break\n\npayIntList = map(int,payList)\n\nfor i in range(numElements):\n         payIntList[i] = payIntList[i] + 1000\n         print payIntList[i]\n```\nThe error happens at line `payIntList[i] = payIntList[i] + 1000`."

        "content": "The error you're encountering is due to how the `map` function works in Python 3. In Python 3, `map` returns a map object, which is an iterator and not a list. This map object is not subscriptable, meaning you cannot access its elements using an index like `payIntList[i]`.\n\nTo fix this issue, you need to convert the map object to a list. You can do this by wrapping the `map` function with `list()`. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\npayList = []\nnumElements = 0\n\nwhile True:\n    payValue = raw_input(\"Enter the pay amount: \")\n    numElements = numElements + 1\n    payList.append(payValue)\n    choice = raw_input(\"Do you wish to continue(y/n)?\")\n    if choice == 'n' or choice == 'N':\n        break\n\n# Convert the map object to a list\npayIntList = list(map(int, payList))\n\nfor i in range(numElements):\n    payIntList[i] = payIntList[i] + 1000\n    print(payIntList[i])\n```\n\nAdditionally, if you're using Python 3, you should replace `raw_input()` with `input()` since `raw_input()` was renamed to `input()` in Python 3."
