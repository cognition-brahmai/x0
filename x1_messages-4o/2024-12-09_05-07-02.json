        "content": "I'm having an issue when trying to change the figure size using plt.subplots in Python. Despite specifying the figure size as (50,100), I end up with the standard size graph where all my subplots (around 100) are bunched in. Additionally, I get an extra empty figure size. I also tried using tight_layout, but it didn't work. Here's the code I'm using:\n\n```python\ndef plot(reader):\n    channels=[]\n    for i in reader:\n        channels.append(i)\n\n    plt.figure(figsize=(50,100))\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(channels), sharex=True)\n\n    plot=0    \n    for j in reader: \n\n        ax[plot].plot(reader[\"%s\" % j])\n        plot=plot+1\n\n    plt.tight_layout()\n    plt.show()\n```\n\nCould someone please help me solve this issue?"

        "content": "It seems like you're encountering a couple of issues with your code. The problem arises because you're creating an initial figure with `plt.figure(figsize=(50, 100))`, and then calling `plt.subplots()`, which creates its own figure. Additionally, you're not specifying the figure size in `plt.subplots()`. Here's how you can adjust your code to resolve these issues:\n\n1. Remove the initial `plt.figure(figsize=(50, 100))` line, as it's not necessary when you're using `plt.subplots()`.\n2. Pass the `figsize` parameter directly to `plt.subplots()`.\n\nHere's the revised version of your code:\n\n```python\ndef plot(reader):\n    channels = []\n    for i in reader:\n        channels.append(i)\n\n    # Specify the figure size in plt.subplots()\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(channels), figsize=(50, 100), sharex=True)\n\n    plot = 0    \n    for j in channels:  # Use channels instead of reader directly here\n\n        ax[plot].plot(reader[j])  # Assuming reader is a dictionary-like object\n        plot += 1\n\n    plt.tight_layout()\n    plt.show()\n```\n\nA few additional notes:\n- Make sure that `reader` is an iterable that you can loop over to get the channel names (or keys).\n- Ensure `reader` is a dictionary-like object if you are indexing it with `reader[j]`.\n- This solution assumes `reader[\"%s\" % j]` was intended to access keys of a dictionary-like structure.\n\nWith these adjustments, your plot should have the correct figure size, and you should avoid the issue of having an extra empty figure."
