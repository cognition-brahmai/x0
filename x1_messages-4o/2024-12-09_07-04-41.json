        "content": "How can I mock multiple calls to a specific attribute function in Python, such that it returns a different result for each successive call? For instance, in the provided code, I would like the function 'increment' to return 5 on its first call and then 10 on its second call. However, I am not sure about what I need to implement inside the 'next_inc' function. Additionally, the resources I found, such as this link (http://mock.readthedocs.org/en/latest/examples.html#multiple-calls-with-different-effects), assume that the caller would be an object named \"mock\", but this can't be assumed in my case. \n\nHere is the code I'm working with:\n```python\nimport mock\n\nclass A:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.size = 0\n    def increment(self, amount):\n        self.size += amount\n        return amount\n\n@mock.patch(\"A.increment\")\ndef test_method(self, mock_increment):\n    def diff_inc(*args):\n        def next_inc(*args):\n            #I don't know what belongs in __some_obj__\n            some_obj.side_effect = next_inc\n            return 10\n        return 5\n\n    mock_increment.side_effect = diff_inc\n```"

        "content": "To achieve the desired behavior where the `increment` method returns different results on successive calls, you can use the `side_effect` attribute of the mock object. The `side_effect` can be set to a list of values that will be returned on successive calls, or it can be a function that computes the return value.\n\nIn your provided code, the `diff_inc` function is intended to handle this logic, but it's not completely implemented. Here's how you can modify your code to return 5 on the first call and 10 on the second call by using a list as the `side_effect`:\n\n```python\nfrom unittest import mock\n\nclass A:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.size = 0\n    def increment(self, amount):\n        self.size += amount\n        return amount\n\n@mock.patch.object(A, 'increment')\ndef test_method(mock_increment):\n    # Define the side effect as a list of return values\n    mock_increment.side_effect = [5, 10]\n\n    # Create an instance of A\n    a_instance = A()\n\n    # Call increment twice and check the results\n    result1 = a_instance.increment(1)  # This should return 5\n    result2 = a_instance.increment(1)  # This should return 10\n\n    print(\"First call result:\", result1)  # Output: First call result: 5\n    print(\"Second call result:\", result2)  # Output: Second call result: 10\n\n# Run the test method to see the results\ntest_method()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- The `mock.patch.object` decorator is used to patch the `increment` method of class `A`. This ensures that every call to `increment` on an instance of `A` will instead call the mock object.\n- `mock_increment.side_effect = [5, 10]` sets up the mock to return 5 on the first call and 10 on the second call. The side effect list can contain as many values as you need for successive calls.\n- `test_method` creates an instance of `A` and calls `increment` twice, capturing the return values.\n\nThis approach should work for your use case where you want to return different values for consecutive calls to a method in a unit test."
