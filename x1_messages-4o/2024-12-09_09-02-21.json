        "content": "To improve the performance or efficiency of the `print_numbers` function, consider the following suggestions:\n\n1. **Avoid Using the `print` Function in Loops**: Printing to the console is generally a slow operation. If you need to perform this in a performance-critical section, consider storing the values in a list and then printing them all at once after the loop. This minimizes the number of I/O operations.\n\n2. **Use a List Comprehension (if appropriate)**: Instead of printing each number in the loop, you can use a list comprehension to generate the numbers first. This doesn't directly improve the performance but can make the code cleaner and easier to read. However, this depends on the context and requirement for output.\n\n3. **Consider the Range Function**: If you're simply printing numbers from 3 to n that are multiples of 3, you can use Python's `range` function to generate these numbers directly:\n\n```python\ndef print_numbers(n):\n    for i in range(3, n + 1, 3):\n        print(i)\n```\n\nThis uses the `range` function which is optimized for such operations, and it eliminates the need for manually managing the loop variable `i`.\n\n4. **Batch Processing (if necessary)**: If you are dealing with a large value of `n`, consider processing the numbers in batches. This won't necessarily speed up the operation but can help in managing resources better, especially if you are dealing with memory constraints.\n\nUltimately, the best approach depends on the specific requirements and context of your application. If performance is a critical concern, profiling the code to identify bottlenecks is a good first step."
