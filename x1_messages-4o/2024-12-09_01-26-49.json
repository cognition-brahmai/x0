For example, if I have the following 1D array:\n```python\na = array([1, 0, 3])\n```\nI would like to convert it into a 2D array in such a way that it becomes a one-hot encoded array like this:\n```python\nb = array([[0,1,0,0], [1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,1]])\n```"

        "content": "To convert a 1D array of indices into a one-hot encoded 2D array using NumPy, you can use the following approach:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the 1D array of indices\na = np.array([1, 0, 3])\n\n# Determine the number of classes (the maximum index + 1)\nnum_classes = np.max(a) + 1\n\n# Initialize the one-hot encoded array with zeros\nb = np.zeros((a.size, num_classes))\n\n# Set the appropriate elements to 1 based on the indices in 'a'\nb[np.arange(a.size), a] = 1\n\nprint(b)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps:\n\n1. Determine the number of classes (the maximum index in `a` plus one).\n2. Create a 2D array `b` filled with zeros. The shape of `b` is `(number of elements in a, number of classes)`.\n3. Use NumPy's advanced indexing to set the appropriate elements in `b` to 1, based on the indices in `a`.\n\nWhen you run the above code, you will get the desired one-hot encoded 2D array:\n\n```python\narray([[0., 1., 0., 0.],\n       [1., 0., 0., 0.],\n       [0., 0., 0., 1.]])\n```"
