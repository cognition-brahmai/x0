Here is the command I'm running and the error message I'm getting:\n\n```\n$ python -m json.tool < data.json\nNo JSON object could be decoded\n```\n\nAnd here are the contents of my `data.json` file:\n\n```\n$ cat data.json\n{ \"fields\": \n    [\n        [ \"first_name\", null, {} ],\n        [ \"last_name\", null, {} ],\n        [ \"addr1\", null, {} ],\n        [ \"addr2\", null, {} ],\n        [ \"city\", null, {} ],\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nI'm not dealing with single quotes, and the file isn't empty, so I'm uncertain as to what the problem might be. Can anyone help me decode this JSON object?"

        "content": "The error message `No JSON object could be decoded` indicates that the JSON parser is encountering a syntax error in the `data.json` file. Upon examining the contents of your file, it looks like there is an issue with an extra comma in the JSON array, which is not allowed in JSON syntax.\n\nHere's the problematic part of your JSON:\n\n```json\n[\n    [ \"first_name\", null, {} ],\n    [ \"last_name\", null, {} ],\n    [ \"addr1\", null, {} ],\n    [ \"addr2\", null, {} ],\n    [ \"city\", null, {} ],  // <-- Extra comma here\n]\n```\n\nThe trailing comma after the last item in the array is causing the parser to fail. In JSON, trailing commas are not permitted.\n\nTo fix the issue, remove the trailing comma after the last element in the array. Here is the corrected version of your JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"fields\": [\n        [ \"first_name\", null, {} ],\n        [ \"last_name\", null, {} ],\n        [ \"addr1\", null, {} ],\n        [ \"addr2\", null, {} ],\n        [ \"city\", null, {} ]\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nAfter making this change, try running the `json.tool` command again:\n\n```bash\n$ python -m json.tool < data.json\n```\n\nThis should now validate and pretty-print your JSON without any errors."
