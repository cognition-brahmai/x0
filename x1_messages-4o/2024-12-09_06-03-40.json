        "content": "I am facing an issue with loading a pickled file in a module that is different from the module where I pickled the file. I've tried importing the class into the module where I am unpickling my file, but it gives me an AttributeError: Can't get attribute 'Document' on <module '__main__' from ''. The structure of my code is as follows:\n\nIn my utility file, utils.py, I have defined functions to save and load the pickled object:\n\n```python\nimport pickle\n\ndef save_document(doc):\n\n    from class_def import Document\n\n    write_file = open(file_path, 'wb')\n    pickle.dump(doc, write_file)\n\ndef load_document(file_path):\n    from class_def import Document\n\n    doc_file = open(file_path, 'rb')\n    return pickle.load(doc_file)\n```\n\nIn class_def.py, I define a Document object and call the save_document function from utils.py:\n\n```python\nimport utils\n\nclass Document(object):\n    data = \"\"\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    doc = Document()\n    utils.save_document(doc)\n```\n\nIn process.py, I call the load_document function from utils.py:\n\n```python\nimport utils\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n     utils.load_document(file_path)\n```\n\nRunning process.py gives the mentioned AttributeError. If I import the class_def.py file into process.py and run its main method as mentioned in the original thread it works, but I want to be able to run these two modules separately, since the class_def file is a preprocessing step that takes quite some time. How can I solve this?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to how Python's `pickle` module works with object serialization. When you pickle an object, it stores the module and class name in the pickle file. During unpickling, Python tries to import the module and locate the class based on that stored information.\n\nThe `AttributeError` you're seeing is because Python cannot find the `Document` class in the `__main__` module, as the pickled file expects the `Document` class to be in the same module it was pickled from.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Consistent Module Imports:**\n   Make sure that the module where the `Document` class is defined is imported consistently in both the pickling and unpickling scripts. Avoid using the `__main__` module for definitions that need to be shared across different scripts.\n\n2. **Modify the Import Structure:**\n   Move the `Document` class to a separate module, say `document.py`, and import it in both `utils.py` and `process.py`.\n\nHere's how you can structure your code:\n\n**`document.py`:**\n```python\nclass Document(object):\n    data = \"\"\n```\n\n**`utils.py`:**\n```python\nimport pickle\nfrom document import Document\n\ndef save_document(doc, file_path):\n    with open(file_path, 'wb') as write_file:\n        pickle.dump(doc, write_file)\n\ndef load_document(file_path):\n    with open(file_path, 'rb') as doc_file:\n        return pickle.load(doc_file)\n```\n\n**`class_def.py`:**\n```python\nimport utils\nfrom document import Document\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    doc = Document()\n    file_path = 'your_file_path.pkl'  # specify your file path here\n    utils.save_document(doc, file_path)\n```\n\n**`process.py`:**\n```python\nimport utils\nfrom document import Document  # Ensure Document is imported\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    file_path = 'your_file_path.pkl'  # specify your file path here\n    doc = utils.load_document(file_path)\n    # Do something with the loaded document\n```\n\n**Key Points to Consider:**\n\n- **Separate Class Definition:** Keep the class definition in its own module (`document.py`) so it can be imported consistently across different modules.\n\n- **Avoid `__main__` for Pickling:** Ensure that the class is not defined in a script that may be executed as `__main__` when pickling or unpickling.\n\n- **Check File Paths:** Always make sure to specify the correct file path when saving and loading the pickled file.\n\nBy ensuring that the `Document` class is consistently imported and available in the same module path during both pickling and unpickling, you should be able to resolve the `AttributeError`."
