I currently face an issue where the kernel calls are not properly recognized, especially the '<<< >>>' syntax. This is causing the formatting to be incorrect. For example, a kernel call like 'kernelName <<<N,M>>> (arg0,arg1,...);' is being transformed into 'kernelName << < N, M > > > (arg0,arg1,...);'. I would prefer a formatting style that looks more like a function call and does not modify the '<<< >>>' syntax. Ideally, it should look like 'kernelName <<< N, M >>> (arg0,arg1,...);' where there is a line break if the argument list is too long. What arguments do I need to add to my 'config.cfg' file to achieve this?"

        "content": "To configure Uncrustify to properly recognize and format CUDA kernel calls in the Atom editor, you'll need to modify your `config.cfg` to handle the `<<< >>>` syntax correctly. Uncrustify may not natively support CUDA syntax perfectly out of the box, but you can adjust its behavior to better accommodate your needs.\n\nHere is a general approach to achieve the desired formatting:\n\n1. **Preserve the `<<< >>>` syntax**: Ensure that Uncrustify doesn't split or misinterpret the angle brackets.\n\n2. **Treat kernel calls as function calls**: You want to make Uncrustify treat CUDA kernel launches more like function calls in terms of formatting.\n\n3. **Break lines for long argument lists**: Configure line breaks for arguments as needed.\n\nAdd the following settings to your `config.cfg` file:\n\n```ini\n# Ensure that spaces within the <<< >>> are preserved\nsp_kernel_launch_before = add\nsp_kernel_launch_after = add\n\n# Ensure that spaces around commas in the <<< >>> section are handled correctly\nnl_kernel_launch = false\nnl_kernel_launch_args = force\n\n# Control how the kernel invocation is treated\nsp_func_call_paren = force\nnl_func_call_opening_paren = nospace\nnl_func_call_name_only = nospace\n\n# Control line breaks within the argument list of the kernel launch\nnl_func_call_args = force\nnl_func_call_args_list = false\nnl_func_call_args_paren = false\n\n# Control spacing for function call parameters\nsp_func_call_paren_inner = force\nsp_func_call_paren_outer = force\n\n# Control the general spacing within the function call\nsp_after_func_call_paren_open = force\nsp_before_func_call_paren_close = force\n```\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n- **Test and Iterate**: After applying these settings, test with various kernel calls to ensure it behaves as expected. Uncrustify's behavior can be quite specific, so some trial and error may be needed.\n  \n- **Custom Hooks**: If Uncrustify still doesn't fully meet your needs, consider using a post-processing script to fix any remaining issues after Uncrustify has run.\n\n- **Keep Updated**: Check for updates to Uncrustify as newer versions might offer better support for CUDA syntax.\n\n- **Community Input**: Engage with the Uncrustify community or forums for additional tips or scripts that others might be using for CUDA formatting.\n\nBy adjusting these settings, you should achieve a more suitable formatting style for your CUDA kernel calls in the Atom editor."
