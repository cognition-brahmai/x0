Can you suggest a good way to achieve this?"

However, you can achieve the desired result by converting the string into a list, where each character of the string becomes an element of the list. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\na = '1111'\nresult = list(a)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis will give you the output:\n\n```\n['1', '1', '1', '1']\n```\n\nUsing the `list()` function on a string will effectively split the string into its individual characters."
