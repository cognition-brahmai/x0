I am looking to combine these files into a single file but with each dataset maintained separately, that is, I do not want to concatenate the datasets into one. I know I can create an hdf5 file and copy the datasets one by one, but this seems slow and complex as it requires buffered copy. Is there a simpler way to accomplish this, as it seems like I am just creating a container file?"

        "content": "Certainly! Combining multiple HDF5 files into a single HDF5 file while maintaining each dataset separately can be streamlined using the `h5py` library. The key is to create a new HDF5 file and use the `h5py`'s built-in functionality to link or copy datasets efficiently. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n\n1. **Install h5py**: Ensure you have the `h5py` library installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install h5py\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a New HDF5 File**: Open or create a new HDF5 file where you'll store all datasets from the original files.\n\n3. **Copy Datasets**: Use the `h5py`'s `copy` method to efficiently copy datasets from each original file to the new file. This avoids loading the entire dataset into RAM.\n\nHere's a sample Python script demonstrating this process:\n\n```python\nimport h5py\n\n# List of source HDF5 files\nsource_files = ['file1.h5', 'file2.h5', 'file3.h5']  # Add your file names here\n\n# Name of the target HDF5 file\ntarget_file = 'combined.h5'\n\n# Open the target file in write mode\nwith h5py.File(target_file, 'w') as target_h5:\n    for file_index, file_name in enumerate(source_files):\n        with h5py.File(file_name, 'r') as source_h5:\n            # Iterate through all datasets in the source file\n            for dataset_name in source_h5:\n                # Create a group for each original file to avoid naming conflicts\n                group = target_h5.create_group(f'file{file_index}')\n                \n                # Copy each dataset to the new file under its respective group\n                source_h5.copy(dataset_name, group)\n\nprint(\"All datasets have been successfully combined into\", target_file)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Target File**: This script creates a new HDF5 file named `combined.h5`.\n- **Groups for Separation**: For each source file, it creates a separate group (e.g., `file0`, `file1`, etc.) in the target file to keep datasets organized and avoid name conflicts.\n- **Efficient Copy**: The `copy` method of `h5py` is used to transfer datasets without loading them entirely into memory, making it efficient for large datasets.\n\nThis approach should help you maintain the structure and separation of datasets within a new HDF5 container file efficiently."
