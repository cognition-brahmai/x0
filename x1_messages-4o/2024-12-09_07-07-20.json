Currently, I am able to find all div's where the class is exactly \"span3\" by using `result = soup.findAll(\"div\",{\"class\":\"span3\"})`. However, my requirement is to find div's such as `<div id=\"span3 span49\">` and `<div id=\"span3 span39\">`. I am familiar with regular expressions but I am unsure how to implement them in BeautifulSoup. Can you guide me on how to accomplish this?"

        "content": "Certainly! To find all `<div>` elements where the class attribute starts with \"span3\", you can use BeautifulSoup in conjunction with Python's `re` module for regular expressions. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport re\n\n# Sample HTML content\nhtml_content = '''\n<div class=\"span3\">Content 1</div>\n<div class=\"span3 span49\">Content 2</div>\n<div class=\"span3 span39\">Content 3</div>\n<div class=\"span4\">Content 4</div>\n'''\n\n# Parse the HTML content with BeautifulSoup\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')\n\n# Use a regular expression to find all divs where the class starts with \"span3\"\nresult = soup.find_all(\"div\", class_=re.compile(r'\\bspan3\\b'))\n\n# Print the results\nfor div in result:\n    print(div)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We import `re` for regular expressions.\n- We pass `class_` parameter with `re.compile(r'\\bspan3\\b')` to `find_all()`. This regex pattern `\\bspan3\\b` looks for the word boundary `\\b` around \"span3\", ensuring that it matches \"span3\" at the start of the class attribute.\n- `find_all()` will return all `<div>` elements where the class attribute starts with \"span3\".\n\nThis method allows you to effectively find all the `<div>` elements with class names that start with \"span3\", regardless of any additional classes they may have."
