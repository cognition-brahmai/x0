When I run the following code:\n\n```python\ninstance = {'one': 1}\n\ninstance.values() == instance.values() # Returns False\ninstance.keys() == instance.keys()     # Returns True\n```\nIn Python 2.7, both calls return True, implying that there is some implementation detail in Python 3's `dict_values` causing this inconsistency. Is there a specific reason for this behavior or have I stumbled upon an obscure bug?"

        "content": "In Python 3, the behavior you're observing is intentional and stems from the way dictionary view objects are implemented. When you call `keys()`, `values()`, or `items()` on a dictionary in Python 3, they return view objects, which are dynamic and provide a view on the dictionary\u2019s entries. These views reflect the current state of the dictionary and update automatically when the dictionary changes.\n\nHere's why you're seeing the behavior:\n\n1. **`dict_keys` View**: When you call `instance.keys()`, it returns a `dict_keys` view object. In Python 3, comparing two `dict_keys` view objects is based on the equality of the keys themselves, not the identity of the view objects. So, calling `instance.keys() == instance.keys()` returns `True` because the keys in the dictionary haven't changed between the two calls.\n\n2. **`dict_values` View**: When you call `instance.values()`, it returns a `dict_values` view object. Unlike `dict_keys`, `dict_values` objects are compared based on their identities, not the values they contain. This means that two separate calls to `instance.values()` will return two different objects, which are not equal to each other. Therefore, `instance.values() == instance.values()` returns `False`.\n\nThis design choice for `dict_values` was made because values in a dictionary are not guaranteed to be unique or hashable, making it difficult to compare them in a meaningful way like keys. As a result, `dict_values` objects are compared based on their identity, leading to the behavior you're observing.\n\nIn contrast, Python 2's `dict` methods return lists, and comparing lists involves checking the equality of their contents, which is why both calls return `True` in Python 2.7.\n\nIf you need to compare the values of a dictionary in Python 3, you can explicitly convert them to a list or another comparable collection type:\n\n```python\nlist(instance.values()) == list(instance.values())  # This will return True\n```\n\nBy doing so, you compare the contents of the lists rather than the identity of the view objects."
