However, I am unable to use the .read() function to view the content as I encounter the 'ResponseNotReady' exception. Could you please explain what 'ResponseNotReady' means and why I am unable to view the returned content?"

        "content": "The `ResponseNotReady` exception in Python's `httplib` (or `http.client` in Python 3) indicates that an attempt was made to read the HTTP response before it was ready. This usually happens when there is a mismatch between the request and response handling.\n\nHere are some potential reasons and solutions for the error you are encountering:\n\n1. **Incorrect Sequence of Operations**: \n   - Ensure that the request has been fully sent before trying to get the response. Typically, this involves calling `h1.endheaders()` or `h1.send()` (depending on whether you are using `httplib` or `http.client`) before calling `h1.getresponse()`.\n\n2. **Reusing the Connection Object**:\n   - If you are reusing the same connection object `h1` for multiple requests, ensure that each request is completed and the response is fully read before starting a new request on the same connection.\n\n3. **Server Delays**:\n   - There might be server-side delays causing the response to not be ready when you attempt to read it. You can try adding a delay or ensure the server is responding correctly in a timely manner.\n\n4. **Check for Connection Persistence**:\n   - If you are using HTTP/1.1, connections are persistent by default. Make sure to close the connection if the server does not support persistent connections or if it is being closed unexpectedly.\n\nHere's a basic example of how the code should be structured:\n\n```python\nimport http.client\n\ndef sendMessage(token, connection):\n    # Assuming 'token' is used for authentication or as part of the request\n    connection.putrequest(\"GET\", \"/your-endpoint\")\n    connection.putheader(\"Authorization\", f\"Bearer {token}\")\n    connection.endheaders()\n    \n    response = connection.getresponse()\n    data = response.read()  # Ensure the response is fully read\n    return data\n\n# Usage example\nconnection = http.client.HTTPConnection(\"your.elgg.server.com\")\ntry:\n    result = sendMessage(\"your_token_here\", connection)\n    print(result)\nfinally:\n    connection.close()  # Always close the connection when done\n```\n\nMake sure you replace `/your-endpoint` and `\"your.elgg.server.com\"` with your actual endpoint and server address. Also, ensure that any headers required for your request are correctly set.\n\nIf you continue facing issues, it might be helpful to use a higher-level HTTP library such as `requests`, which can simplify handling HTTP connections and requests. Here's how you can achieve the same using `requests`:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef sendMessage(token):\n    headers = {\n        \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {token}\"\n    }\n    response = requests.get(\"http://your.elgg.server.com/your-endpoint\", headers=headers)\n    return response.content\n\nresult = sendMessage(\"your_token_here\")\nprint(result)\n```\n\nUsing `requests` often avoids many common pitfalls associated with directly handling HTTP connections."
