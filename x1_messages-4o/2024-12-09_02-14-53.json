I have found a solution for Pep8 where I can exclude directories by using `pep8 --exclude=migrations app_name`. I am wondering if there is a similar approach for Pyflakes, as I couldn't find any proper documentation for it?"

        "content": "Pyflakes itself does not have a built-in option to exclude specific directories directly like you can with tools such as PEP8 (now known as pycodestyle). However, you can achieve the desired effect by using a workaround with command-line tools or scripts to filter out the directories you want to exclude.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple approach using `find` and `xargs` on Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS):\n\n```bash\nfind app_name -name \"*.py\" ! -path \"*/migrations/*\" | xargs pyflakes\n```\n\nIn this command:\n- `find app_name -name \"*.py\"` searches for all Python files in the `app_name` directory.\n- `! -path \"*/migrations/*\"` excludes any files within the `migrations` directory.\n- `xargs pyflakes` passes the resulting list of files to Pyflakes for analysis.\n\nIf you're working on a Windows system, you can achieve similar results using PowerShell:\n\n```powershell\nGet-ChildItem -Recurse -Include *.py -Exclude migrations -Path app_name | ForEach-Object { pyflakes $_.FullName }\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can write a simple Python script to programmatically run Pyflakes on the desired files while excluding the `migrations` directory. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport subprocess\n\ndef run_pyflakes(directory):\n    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):\n        if 'migrations' in dirs:\n            dirs.remove('migrations')  # Exclude migrations directory\n        for file in files:\n            if file.endswith('.py'):\n                file_path = os.path.join(root, file)\n                subprocess.run(['pyflakes', file_path])\n\nrun_pyflakes('app_name')\n```\n\nThis script recursively walks through the `app_name` directory, skips the `migrations` directory, and runs Pyflakes on all Python files. Adjust the `directory` parameter as needed for your project structure."
