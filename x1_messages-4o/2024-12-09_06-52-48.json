        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is related to how shared libraries are loaded, which is different from Python modules and packages. The `sys.path` is used by Python to find modules and packages, but when it comes to shared libraries like `libcurl.so.4`, the system dynamic linker (not Python itself) is responsible for locating them.\n\nHere's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify Library Path**: Ensure that `libcurl.so.4` is indeed located in `/usr/local/lib`. You can do this with a command like:\n   ```bash\n   ls /usr/local/lib/libcurl.so.4\n   ```\n\n2. **Dynamic Linker Configuration**: The system dynamic linker needs to know where to find shared libraries. You can update the linker configuration by adding the directory to the `/etc/ld.so.conf` or a new file under `/etc/ld.so.conf.d/`. For instance, create a new file:\n   ```bash\n   echo \"/usr/local/lib\" | sudo tee /etc/ld.so.conf.d/local-lib.conf\n   ```\n\n3. **Run `ldconfig`**: After updating the configuration, run `ldconfig` to update the linker cache:\n   ```bash\n   sudo ldconfig\n   ```\n\n4. **Environment Variable**: Alternatively, set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to include `/usr/local/lib`:\n   ```bash\n   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n   ```\n   You can add this line to your shell's configuration file (like `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`) to make it persistent.\n\n5. **Check Permissions**: Ensure that the user running the Python script has read permissions for the library file and the directory.\n\nAfter performing these steps, try importing `pycurl` again:\n```bash\npython -c \"import pycurl\"\n```\n\nIf the issue persists, double-check the library path and ensure no typos or permission issues are preventing access to `libcurl.so.4`."
