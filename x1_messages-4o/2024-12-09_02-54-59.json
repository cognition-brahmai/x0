I am looking for a publicly available training set of labeled spam/not spam emails. I would prefer these to be in plain text and not a dump of a relational database, unless there is a way to print those clearly. I know there are such databases available for other types of text classification, specifically news article text, but I have not been able to find the same kind of thing for emails. Can anyone recommend any resources to me?"

        "content": "Creating a Naive Bayes spam filter is a great beginner project for machine learning! There are several publicly available datasets that you can use for training your model. Here are a few popular ones:\n\n1. **Enron Email Dataset**: This is one of the most well-known datasets for email research. It contains a large number of emails from the Enron Corporation, and there are versions of this dataset that have been labeled for spam/not spam. You can find it at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/enron-email-dataset) or other data repositories.\n\n2. **SpamAssassin Public Corpus**: This is another well-known dataset that contains both spam and non-spam emails. It is available in plain text and can be downloaded from the [SpamAssassin website](https://spamassassin.apache.org/publiccorpus/).\n\n3. **Ling-Spam Dataset**: This dataset consists of emails collected from a linguistics mailing list with labeled spam and non-spam emails. It is available for download from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Ling-Spam).\n\n4. **SMS Spam Collection**: While this is more focused on SMS messages, it can be a useful dataset if you're interested in general spam classification techniques. It\u2019s available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) and is in plain text format.\n\nBefore using these datasets, make sure to check their licenses and terms of use to ensure compliance with any restrictions they might have. Good luck with your project!"
