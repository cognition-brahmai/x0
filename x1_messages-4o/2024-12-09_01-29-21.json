        "content": "Yes, it is possible to display the values of each point on the graph using Matplotlib. You can achieve this by iterating over your data points and using the `annotate` function to label each point with its corresponding `y` value. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nx = np.arange(0, 10)\ny = np.array([5, 3, 4, 2, 7, 5, 4, 6, 3, 2])\n\nplt.plot(x, y, marker='o')  # Adding marker to easily spot points\n\n# Annotate each point with its y value\nfor i, txt in enumerate(y):\n    plt.annotate(txt, (x[i], y[i]), textcoords=\"offset points\", xytext=(0, 10), ha='center')\n\nplt.xlabel('X-axis')\nplt.ylabel('Y-axis')\nplt.title('Plot with Annotated Points')\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `marker='o'`: Adds a circular marker at each data point for better visibility.\n- `enumerate(y)`: Allows us to loop over `y` values with their corresponding indices.\n- `plt.annotate(...)`: This function is used to create annotations at each data point.\n  - `txt`: The text you want to annotate, in this case, the `y` value.\n  - `(x[i], y[i])`: The position to place the annotation.\n  - `textcoords=\"offset points\"` and `xytext=(0, 10)`: These parameters adjust the position of the text slightly above the point to prevent overlap with the marker.\n  - `ha='center'`: Horizontally centers the annotation text with respect to the point.\n\nThis will display the `y` values above each point on the plot."
