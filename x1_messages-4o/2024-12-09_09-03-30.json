        "content": "Certainly! You can write a function in R that takes a vector as input and returns a data frame with the count and frequency of each unique item in the vector. Here's a sample function to do that:\n\n```r\ncount_and_frequency <- function(input_vector) {\n  # Convert the input vector to a factor to handle unique items\n  factor_vector <- factor(input_vector)\n  \n  # Get the count of each unique item\n  counts <- table(factor_vector)\n  \n  # Calculate the frequency (proportion) of each unique item\n  frequency <- prop.table(counts)\n  \n  # Create a data frame with the counts and frequencies\n  result_df <- data.frame(\n    Item = names(counts),\n    Count = as.integer(counts),\n    Frequency = as.numeric(frequency)\n  )\n  \n  return(result_df)\n}\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_vector <- c(\"apple\", \"banana\", \"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\", \"apple\")\nresult <- count_and_frequency(input_vector)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis function works by:\n1. Converting the input vector into a factor, ensuring that all unique items are identified.\n2. Using the `table()` function to count the occurrences of each unique item.\n3. Calculating the frequency using `prop.table()` to get the proportion of each item relative to the total number of items.\n4. Creating a data frame with columns for the item, its count, and its frequency, and returning this data frame. \n\nYou can test this function with your own input vector to see the count and frequency of each item."
