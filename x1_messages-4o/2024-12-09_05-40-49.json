        "content": "In Pandas, you can select rows from a DataFrame based on the values in a particular column using boolean indexing. This is similar to the SQL command you mentioned. Here's how you can do it:\n\nSuppose you have the following DataFrame `df`:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndata = {\n    'id': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n    'name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Eve'],\n    'age': [24, 27, 22, 32, 29]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n```\n\nIf you want to select rows where the `name` is 'Alice', you can do it like this:\n\n```python\nselected_rows = df[df['name'] == 'Alice']\n```\n\nThis will return a DataFrame containing only the rows where the `name` column matches 'Alice'.\n\nSimilarly, if you want to select rows based on numerical conditions, such as selecting rows where `age` is greater than 25:\n\n```python\nselected_rows = df[df['age'] > 25]\n```\n\nYou can also combine multiple conditions using logical operators like `&` (and), `|` (or), and `~` (not). For example, if you want to select rows where `age` is greater than 25 and `name` is not 'Bob':\n\n```python\nselected_rows = df[(df['age'] > 25) & (df['name'] != 'Bob')]\n```\n\nRemember to use parentheses to ensure the correct order of operations when combining conditions."
