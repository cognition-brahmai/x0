How can I remove this 'u' character? Here is my code and the output:\n\n```python\ndef get(self):\n    players = db.GqlQuery(\"SELECT * FROM Player\")\n    print players\n    playerInfo  = {}\n\n    test = []\n\n    for player in players:\n        email =  player.email\n        gem =  str(player.gem)\n        a = \"{email:\"+email + \",gem:\" +gem +\"}\"\n\n        test.append(a)\n\n    ast.literal_eval(json.dumps(test))\n    print test\n```\n\nThe final output is:\n\n```python\n[u'{email:test@gmail.com,gem:0}', u'{email:test,gem:0}', u'{email:test,gem:0}', u'{email:test,gem:0}', u'{email:test,gem:0}', u'{email:test1,gem:0}']\n```"

        "content": "The character 'u' before each string in your output indicates that the strings are Unicode strings in Python 2. This is a common feature of Python 2 when dealing with Unicode text. If you're using Python 2 and you want to remove the 'u' from the printed output, you can convert the Unicode strings to standard strings before printing them. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\ndef get(self):\n    players = db.GqlQuery(\"SELECT * FROM Player\")\n    print players\n    playerInfo  = {}\n\n    test = []\n\n    for player in players:\n        email = player.email\n        gem = str(player.gem)\n        a = \"{email:\" + email + \",gem:\" + gem + \"}\"\n\n        test.append(a)\n\n    # Convert the list of Unicode strings to a list of regular strings\n    test = [str(item) for item in test]\n    \n    print test\n```\n\nThis will convert each Unicode string in the `test` list to a regular string, removing the 'u' prefix when printing.\n\nIf you're using Python 3, the 'u' prefix won't appear in your output because all strings are Unicode by default. However, if you're seeing this output, you're likely using Python 2. If you have the ability, consider upgrading to Python 3 where Unicode handling is more straightforward and consistent."
