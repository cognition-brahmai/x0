However, when I try to run it through `mod_wsgi`, I encounter a 500 error with no logs. My findings show that:\n\n- Inserting a line like `print >>sys.stderr, \"hello\"` works as expected and the message shows up in the error log.\n- Calling a method without using a template doesn't cause a 500 error.\n- Using a simple template also works fine.\n- But, triggering a database access inside the template (for example looping over a query) results in a 500 error.\n\nMy suspicion is that SQLAlchemy might be emitting an error and that the logging configuration could be causing the log to be discarded at some point in the application. Also, I am using SQLite for testing which, to my understanding, can only be accessed from one thread. So, if `mod_wsgi` spawns more threads, it may disrupt the app. My main concern is that the errors only occur when running behind `mod_wsgi` and it seems to suppress my errors. How can I make these errors appear in the Apache error_log? The full code can be seen on this [github permalink](https://github.com/exhuma/mypi/tree/9610d37341495e9eb5a295d078dbf480cd161c16)."

        "content": "When dealing with a 500 error in a Flask application running under `mod_wsgi`, it's crucial to ensure that you can capture and view the error logs to identify the root cause. Here are some steps and tips to help you diagnose and fix the issue:\n\n1. **Enable Debugging for Development**: Temporarily enable Flask's debugging mode to get detailed error messages. Set `app.debug = True` in your Flask application. However, be cautious and ensure this is only enabled in a development environment, not in production.\n\n2. **Configure WSGI to Output Logs**: Ensure that `mod_wsgi` is configured to capture error logs. You can modify your Apache configuration to ensure logs are being captured properly. In your Apache configuration file (usually `httpd.conf` or a site-specific configuration file):\n\n   ```apache\n   WSGIDaemonProcess yourapp user=www-data group=www-data threads=5\n   WSGIProcessGroup yourapp\n   WSGIScriptAlias / /path/to/yourapp.wsgi\n\n   <Directory /path/to/yourapp>\n       Require all granted\n   </Directory>\n\n   ErrorLog /path/to/error.log\n   LogLevel debug\n   ```\n\n3. **Check WSGI Script**: Ensure your WSGI script file is set up correctly. It should look something like this:\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   sys.path.insert(0, '/path/to/your/application')\n\n   from yourapplication import app as application\n   ```\n\n4. **Logging Configuration**: Ensure that your logging configuration in Flask is set to write to `stderr` so `mod_wsgi` can capture it. You can set up logging in your Flask application like this:\n\n   ```python\n   import logging\n   import sys\n\n   logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stderr, level=logging.DEBUG)\n   ```\n\n5. **SQLite and Threading**: SQLite does have limitations with multi-threaded environments. If `mod_wsgi` is using multiple threads, you might encounter issues. You can set `check_same_thread` to `False` in your database URI, but be cautious as this might lead to data consistency issues:\n\n   ```python\n   app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///yourdatabase.db?check_same_thread=False'\n   ```\n\n6. **Inspect SQLAlchemy**: If you suspect SQLAlchemy is causing issues, enable its logging to see SQL operations:\n\n   ```python\n   import logging\n   logging.getLogger('sqlalchemy.engine').setLevel(logging.INFO)\n   ```\n\n7. **Check Permissions**: Ensure that the user running the Apache server (often `www-data` or `apache`) has the correct permissions to access your application files and database.\n\n8. **Consult the Apache Error Logs**: After applying these changes, restart your Apache server and check the error logs (`/path/to/error.log` as configured above) for detailed error messages.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to capture the necessary error information from the logs to debug the issue effectively."
