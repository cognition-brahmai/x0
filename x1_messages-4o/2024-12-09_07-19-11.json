Keywords, properties, and comments should be displayed in different colors, indicating that syntax highlighting is working.\n\nBy following these steps, you should have syntax highlighting for .kv files enabled in PyCharm on macOS. If you encounter any issues, make sure the plugin is compatible with your version of PyCharm and that it's properly installed."
