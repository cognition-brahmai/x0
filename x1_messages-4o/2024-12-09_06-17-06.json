I am trying to extract information from a webpage which loads 10 items at a time and I need to scroll to load all entries (for a total of 100). Currently, I am using Python, requests, and BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and get the information that I need for the first 10 entries. However, I want to fully load all entries before parsing the HTML. Is there a way to accomplish this without parsing an intricate JSON response?\n\nHere is the code I am using to parse the page when it loads with the first 10 entries:\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport requests\ns = requests.Session()\nr = s.get('https://medium.com/top-100/december-2013')\npage = BeautifulSoup(r.text)\n```\n\nAnd here is the code I am using to load the subsequent entries:\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport requests\nimport json\ns = requests.Session()\nurl = 'https://medium.com/top-100/december-2013/load-more'\npayload = {\"count\":100}\nr = s.post(url, data=payload)\npage = json.loads(r.text[16:]) #skip some chars that throw json off\n```"

        "content": "To handle infinite scrolling and load all entries at once, you can simulate the scrolling behavior by making multiple requests to the server until all entries are loaded. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Identify the API endpoint**: First, you need to identify the API endpoint that the website uses to load more entries when you scroll. Use the browser's developer tools (Network tab) to inspect the requests being made as you scroll down the page.\n\n2. **Simulate scrolling**: Use a loop to send requests to the identified endpoint until all items are loaded.\n\n3. **Combine the data**: Append the data fetched from each request until you have all the entries.\n\nHere is an example approach using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport requests\nimport json\n\ndef load_all_entries():\n    session = requests.Session()\n    base_url = 'https://medium.com/top-100/december-2013'\n    load_more_url = 'https://medium.com/top-100/december-2013/load-more'  # This should be the endpoint for loading more items\n    all_entries = []\n    count = 0\n    total_entries = 100  # Adjust this to the total number of entries you expect\n\n    # Load the first set of entries\n    response = session.get(base_url)\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\n    # Extract initial 10 items from the soup and add to all_entries\n    all_entries.extend(parse_entries(soup))\n\n    # Now load additional entries until you have them all\n    while count < total_entries:\n        payload = {\"count\": len(all_entries)}\n        response = session.post(load_more_url, data=payload)\n        data = json.loads(response.text[16:])  # Parse JSON response\n        # Extract new items from the response data\n        new_entries = parse_entries(data)\n        all_entries.extend(new_entries)\n        count += len(new_entries)\n        if not new_entries:\n            break  # Exit if no new entries are loaded\n\n    return all_entries\n\ndef parse_entries(soup_or_data):\n    # This function should parse either BeautifulSoup object or the JSON data\n    # and return a list of entries.\n    entries = []\n    # Example parsing logic (adjust according to the page structure):\n    for entry in soup_or_data.find_all('div', class_='entry'):\n        title = entry.find('h1').text\n        # Add more fields as needed\n        entries.append(title)\n    return entries\n\n# Now call the function to load all entries\nall_entries = load_all_entries()\nprint(all_entries)\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- The `load_more_url` and payload structure might differ based on the actual API implementation. Inspect the network requests to find the correct endpoint and parameters.\n- The `parse_entries` function should be adjusted to extract the necessary information from either the HTML or JSON response.\n- Ensure you have proper error handling and pagination logic if the server sets limits on the number of entries returned per request."
