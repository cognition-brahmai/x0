Let's consider the following code as an example:\n\n```python\ndef read_contents(file_path):\n  return file(file_path).read()\n```\n\nIf the file handle doesn't automatically close, how can I modify this function to ensure the file handle is closed once it's no longer needed?"

The file will remain open until it is explicitly closed, which can lead to resource leaks if not handled properly.\n\nTo ensure that the file handle is properly closed once it's no longer needed, you can use the `with` statement, which is a context manager that automatically closes the file when the block of code is exited. Here's how you can modify the `read_contents` function to use a `with` statement:\n\n```python\ndef read_contents(file_path):\n    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n        return file.read()\n```\n\nIn this modified version, the `with` statement opens the file and automatically ensures that the file is closed after the block of code inside the `with` statement is executed, even if an exception is raised. This is the recommended way to handle file operations in Python."
