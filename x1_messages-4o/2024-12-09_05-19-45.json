        "content": "To trace the path of a Breadth-First Search (BFS) in a tree and find the shortest list connecting the root node to a target node, such as going from '1' to '11', you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initialize Structures**:\n   - Use a queue to facilitate the BFS traversal. The queue will help in exploring nodes level by level.\n   - Maintain a dictionary to keep track of each node's parent. This will help in reconstructing the path once the target node is found.\n\n2. **Start BFS**:\n   - Enqueue the root node (in this case, '1') and mark it as visited.\n   - Set the parent of the root node to `None` since it has no parent.\n\n3. **Perform Traversal**:\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue the front node.\n   - Check if this node is the target node ('11'). If it is, you can stop the search.\n   - If not, enqueue all its unvisited children, mark them as visited, and record their parent as the current node.\n\n4. **Reconstruct the Path**:\n   - Once the target node ('11') is found, use the parent dictionary to backtrack from the target node to the root node.\n   - Start from '11', look up its parent, and keep following the chain of parents until you reach the root node ('1').\n   - Reverse this list to get the path from the root to the target node.\n\n5. **Example**:\n   - Let's assume the tree structure is such that '1' has children '2', '3', '4'; '2' has children '5', '6'; '3' has children '7', '8', and '11', and so on.\n   - The BFS queue would process nodes in the order: '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '11'.\n   - When '11' is found, trace back using the parent dictionary: '11' -> '3' -> '1'.\n   - The shortest path from '1' to '11' is [1, 3, 11].\n\nHere's a Python-like pseudocode for better understanding:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_path(tree, start, target):\n    queue = deque([start])\n    parent = {start: None}\n    \n    while queue:\n        current = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if current == target:\n            break\n        \n        for child in tree.get(current, []):\n            if child not in parent:\n                queue.append(child)\n                parent[child] = current\n\n    # Reconstruct the path\n    path = []\n    while target is not None:\n        path.append(target)\n        target = parent[target]\n    \n    return path[::-1]\n\n# Example tree structure\ntree = {\n    '1': ['2', '3', '4'],\n    '2': ['5', '6'],\n    '3': ['7', '8', '11'],\n    '4': [],\n    '5': [],\n    '6': [],\n    '7': [],\n    '8': [],\n    '11': []\n}\n\nprint(bfs_path(tree, '1', '11'))  # Output: ['1', '3', '11']\n```\n\nThis code will output the shortest path from '1' to '11' using BFS. Adjust the tree structure as per your specific tree."
