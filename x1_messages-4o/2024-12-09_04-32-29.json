However, the method is not producing the expected results. For instance, when I call the function using the path to the main folder in my directory structure, some of the recursion levels for the directories are incorrect. How can I modify my function to correctly calculate the level of recursion for each directory in the path?\n\nHere is my current code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nfunccount = 0\n\ndef reccount(src):\n    global funccount\n    print \"Function level of %s is %d\" %(src, funccount)\n\ndef runrec(src):\n    global funccount\n    funccount = funccount + 1\n    lists = os.listdir(src)\n    if((len(lists) == 0)):\n        funccount = funccount - 1\n    reccount(src)\n    for x in lists:\n         srcname = os.path.join(src, x)\n         if((len(lists) - 1) == lists.index(x)):\n              if (not(os.path.isdir(srcname))):\n                   funccount = funccount - 1\n         if os.path.isdir(srcname):\n            runrec(srcname)\n\nrunrec(C:\\test)\n```\n\nThis is the directory structure:\n\n```\nTest:\n   |----------doc\n   |----------share\n                |----------doc\n                            |----------file1\n   |----------bin\n                |----------common\n                             |----------doc\n   |----------extras\n   |----------file2\n```\n\nAnd these are the current results:\n\n```\nFunction level of C:\\test is 1\nFunction level of C:\\test\\bin is 2\nFunction level of C:\\test\\bin\\common is 3\nFunction level of C:\\test\\bin\\common\\doc is 3\nFunction level of C:\\test\\doc is 3\nFunction level of C:\\test\\extras is 3\nFunction level of C:\\test\\share is 4\nFunction level of C:\\test\\share\\doc is 5\n```\n\nAs you can see, when it prints results for bin/common/doc, it prints 3 instead of 4 and all subsequent results are wrong."

        "content": "The issue with your current implementation lies in how the `funccount` variable is being managed. You're using a global variable to track recursion depth, but the manipulation of this variable isn't accurately reflecting the recursive call stack due to the order of operations and how it's adjusted.\n\nA better approach is to pass the depth information as an argument to the function rather than using a global variable. This ensures that each recursive call has its own depth value, which is incremented or decremented appropriately during the recursion process.\n\nHere's a revised version of your function that should work correctly:\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef reccount(src, level):\n    print(\"Function level of {} is {}\".format(src, level))\n\ndef runrec(src, level=1):\n    reccount(src, level)\n    lists = os.listdir(src)\n    for x in lists:\n        srcname = os.path.join(src, x)\n        if os.path.isdir(srcname):\n            runrec(srcname, level + 1)\n\n# Replace 'C:\\\\test' with the actual path you want to test\nrunrec('C:\\\\test')\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Function Parameters:** The `runrec` function now takes an additional parameter `level`, which defaults to 1 for the topmost directory.\n\n2. **Level Tracking:** Instead of using a global variable, the recursion level is passed to each function call. When a directory is encountered, the function calls itself with an incremented level.\n\n3. **Directory Check:** The function checks if the current item is a directory, and if so, it recursively calls `runrec` with the incremented level.\n\n4. **Printing Levels:** The `reccount` function is called to print the current directory and its level.\n\nThis change ensures that the recursion depth is accurately tracked for each directory, resolving the inaccuracies you encountered."
