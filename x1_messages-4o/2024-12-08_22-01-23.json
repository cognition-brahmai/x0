Below is a Python code that defines a function `beach_visit_sentence`, which generates a sentence based on the given conditions.\n\n```python\ndef beach_visit_sentence(temperature, sea_creature_count):\n    if temperature < 60 and sea_creature_count >= 5:\n        return \"We decided to visit the beach where the temperature was pleasantly below 60\u00b0F, and we marveled at the diversity of at least 5 different species of sea creatures in the nearby waters.\"\n    else:\n        return \"The conditions for a beach visit with cool weather and abundant sea life were not met.\"\n\n# Example usage:\nsentence = beach_visit_sentence(55, 6)\nprint(sentence)\n```\n\nThis function checks if the temperature is below 60\u00b0F and if there are at least 5 different species of sea creatures present. If both conditions are met, it returns a sentence describing the visit; otherwise, it returns a message indicating that the conditions were not met."
