Here's a song lyric formatted as a poem using Markdown:\n\n```markdown\n# **Whispers of the Night**\n\n*Verse 1*  \nIn the hush of the twilight glow,  \nDreams take flight, where shadows go.  \nStarlit paths where secrets lie,  \nUnderneath the velvet sky.\n\n*Chorus*  \nWhispers of the night, calling out my name,  \nIn the gentle breeze, a flickering flame.  \nHeartbeats echo, in the silent air,  \nIn the night\u2019s embrace, we are free from care.\n\n*Verse 2*  \nMoonlit rivers softly flow,  \nCarrying tales from long ago.  \nIn the stillness, voices sing,  \nOf forgotten tales and the promise of spring.\n\n*Chorus*  \nWhispers of the night, calling out my name,  \nIn the gentle breeze, a flickering flame.  \nHeartbeats echo, in the silent air,  \nIn the night\u2019s embrace, we are free from care.\n\n*Bridge*  \nUnderneath the stars, we dance,  \nIn a world of dreams, lost in a trance.  \nEvery moment, a timeless flight,  \nBound together by whispers of the night.\n\n*Outro*  \nWhispers of the night, forever we'll remain,  \nIn this endless dream, where love knows no pain.  \nIn the night\u2019s embrace, we find our way,  \nGuided by the whispers, through the break of day.\n```\n\nI hope you like it!"
