So far, I've been using `setUp`/`tearDown` pair of methods for test \"set up\" and \"tear down\" phases. Why should I switch to `addCleanup` instead of `tearDown`? This topic was also recently discussed in the Python unittest with Robert Collins podcast."

        "content": "Ned Batchelder's suggestion to use `addCleanup` instead of `tearDown` in `unittest` is based on a few key advantages that `addCleanup` offers over the traditional `tearDown` method. Here\u2019s why you might consider switching:\n\n1. **Multiple Cleanups**: `addCleanup` allows you to register multiple cleanup functions, which can be useful when you have multiple resources that need to be cleaned up. These cleanup functions are called in the reverse order of their registration, ensuring that resources are released in a logical order.\n\n2. **Exception Safety**: If an exception is raised in your test method, or in one of the cleanup functions, `addCleanup` ensures that all registered cleanup functions are still executed. This is not the case with `tearDown`, where an exception could prevent subsequent cleanup actions from running.\n\n3. **Simpler Code**: By using `addCleanup`, you can register cleanup actions right after the resource is acquired, keeping related code close together. This makes the code easier to read and maintain compared to having all cleanup code in a separate `tearDown` method.\n\n4. **Modularity**: Test code becomes more modular and easier to reason about, as each resource's setup and cleanup can be handled together. This modularity can significantly improve test code organization, especially in complex tests with multiple resources.\n\n5. **Flexibility**: `addCleanup` provides greater flexibility in managing resources. For instance, you can conditionally register cleanup functions, making it easier to handle resources that might be only optionally used in a test.\n\nSwitching to `addCleanup` can lead to more robust and maintainable test code, especially in tests that involve multiple resources or complex setups. If you're currently using `setUp`/`tearDown`, it might be worth considering `addCleanup` for these benefits."
