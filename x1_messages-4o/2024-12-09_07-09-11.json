When you try to access a column that doesn't exist using `.loc`, it raises an error.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you should first check which columns are actually present in your DataFrame and then adjust your `filtered_columns` list accordingly. Here are the steps you can take:\n\n1. **Check the Available Columns**: Print out the columns of your DataFrame to see which ones are available.\n\n    ```python\n    print(tips_df.columns)\n    ```\n\n2. **Verify and Adjust `filtered_columns`**: Compare the printed list of columns to your `filtered_columns` list and remove or correct any column names that do not exist in the DataFrame.\n\n3. **Filter Using Existing Columns Only**: After adjusting the `filtered_columns` list, proceed with filtering the DataFrame.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\n# Check the available columns in the DataFrame\nprint(tips_df.columns)\n\n# Create a list of columns that are actually present in the DataFrame\nexisting_columns = [col for col in filtered_columns if col in tips_df.columns]\n\n# Filter the DataFrame using only the existing columns\ntips_filtered = tips_df.loc[:, existing_columns]\n\n# Display the filtered DataFrame\ntips_filtered\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you ensure that you're only attempting to access columns that exist in your DataFrame, thus avoiding the error."
