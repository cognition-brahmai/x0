Here is a list of reviews:\nreviews = [\n    \"This phone is amazing, I can't believe how fast it is!\",\n    \"The battery life on this phone is terrible.\",\n    \"I love the sleek design of this phone.\",\n    \"The camera on this phone is decent, but not the best.\",\n    \"I had a bad experience with this phone, it constantly freezes and crashes.\"\n]\nYour goal is to write a Python code that will determine the sentiment of each review. However, the catch is that the sentiment categories have been replaced with emojis! Positive reviews should be classified with a \ud83d\ude0a emoji, negative reviews with a \ud83d\ude14 emoji, and neutral reviews with a \ud83d\ude10 emoji. Good luck!"

        "content": "To analyze the sentiment of each review and classify them using emojis, you can utilize a simple approach with keyword matching or leverage a sentiment analysis library. Here's a basic example using keyword matching to classify the reviews:\n\n```python\nreviews = [\n    \"This phone is amazing, I can't believe how fast it is!\",\n    \"The battery life on this phone is terrible.\",\n    \"I love the sleek design of this phone.\",\n    \"The camera on this phone is decent, but not the best.\",\n    \"I had a bad experience with this phone, it constantly freezes and crashes.\"\n]\n\ndef classify_sentiment(review):\n    positive_keywords = ['amazing', 'fast', 'love', 'sleek']\n    negative_keywords = ['terrible', 'bad', 'freezes', 'crashes']\n    \n    review_lower = review.lower()\n    \n    positive_score = sum(word in review_lower for word in positive_keywords)\n    negative_score = sum(word in review_lower for word in negative_keywords)\n    \n    if positive_score > negative_score:\n        return '\ud83d\ude0a'\n    elif negative_score > positive_score:\n        return '\ud83d\ude14'\n    else:\n        return '\ud83d\ude10'\n\nclassified_reviews = [(review, classify_sentiment(review)) for review in reviews]\n\nfor review, sentiment in classified_reviews:\n    print(f\"Review: {review}\\nSentiment: {sentiment}\\n\")\n```\n\nThis script defines a simple function `classify_sentiment` which checks for the presence of positive and negative keywords in each review. It returns a corresponding emoji based on the sentiment determined by the keywords. You can extend this logic or improve it using a sentiment analysis library like TextBlob or Vader, which would provide more robust sentiment analysis capabilities."
