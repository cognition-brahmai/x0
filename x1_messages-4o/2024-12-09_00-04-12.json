        "content": "To modify the provided C++ code so that it displays a randomly selected goal from a user-defined list of goals, you need to ensure the code is properly handling user input and generating a random index to select a goal. The code you provided is almost correct, but it will try to generate a random index even if the user hasn't entered any goals, which could lead to undefined behavior. Let's improve it by adding a check to ensure that there are goals entered before attempting to select one randomly:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <cstdlib>\n#include <ctime>\n#include <vector>\nusing namespace std;\n\nint main() {\n    srand(time(0)); // Seed random number generator\n    \n    // Vector to hold user-defined goals\n    vector<string> goals;\n    \n    // Ask user for goals and add to vector\n    string goal;\n    cout << \"Enter your goals (type 'done' to finish):\" << endl;\n    while (true) {\n        getline(cin, goal);\n        if (goal == \"done\") {\n            break;\n        }\n        goals.push_back(goal);\n    }\n\n    // Check if the goals vector is not empty\n    if (!goals.empty()) {\n        // Generate random index to select goal from vector\n        int index = rand() % goals.size();\n        \n        // Display randomly selected goal\n        cout << \"Your goal is: \" << goals[index] << endl;\n    } else {\n        cout << \"No goals were entered.\" << endl;\n    }\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Changes made:\n\n1. **Loop condition**: Changed the `while` loop to `while (true)` with a `break` statement when the user types \"done\". This is a more common pattern for reading input until a specific condition is met.\n\n2. **Check for empty vector**: Before attempting to select a random goal, the code now checks if the vector `goals` is not empty. If it is empty, it prints a message indicating that no goals were entered.\n\nThis ensures that the program behaves correctly even if the user doesn't enter any goals."
