        "content": "The `ImportMismatchError` you're encountering usually occurs when pytest detects a mismatch between the expected file path of a module and the actual file path from which the module is being imported. This mismatch often arises in Docker or other containerized environments due to differences in how paths are set up compared to your local machine.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to help you troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Docker Volume Mounts:**\n   Ensure that the directory structure inside the Docker container mirrors the structure on your local machine. If you're mounting volumes, check that the paths are consistent.\n\n2. **Verify `WORKDIR`:**\n   Confirm that the `WORKDIR` in your Dockerfile is set correctly. In your case, it should match the path where the code is located, which seems to be `/apis`.\n\n3. **Pytest Path Configuration:**\n   Make sure pytest is running in the correct directory. If you're launching pytest from a different directory, it might not find the correct `conftest.py`. You can explicitly specify the test directory when running pytest:\n   ```sh\n   pytest /apis/db/tests\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for Multiple `conftest.py` Files:**\n   Ensure there are no duplicate `conftest.py` files in different paths that could be causing the confusion. Delete any unnecessary copies.\n\n5. **Docker Cache:**\n   Sometimes Docker caches files, so make sure to rebuild the Docker image without using the cache. You can do this with:\n   ```sh\n   docker build --no-cache -t my_image_name .\n   ```\n\n6. **Python Path:**\n   Check if your `PYTHONPATH` is set correctly within the Docker container. It should include the root directory of your project. You can set it in the Dockerfile:\n   ```dockerfile\n   ENV PYTHONPATH=/apis\n   ```\n\n7. **Directory Structure:**\n   Double-check that the directory structure within the Docker container matches what pytest expects. You can do this by running a shell inside the container and navigating through the directories:\n   ```sh\n   docker run -it my_container_name /bin/sh\n   ```\n\n8. **Ensure Consistent Environment:**\n   Make sure that the Python version and all dependencies (including pytest and its plugins) are the same between your local environment and the Docker container.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the `ImportMismatchError` by ensuring path consistency within your Docker environment. If the issue persists, consider adding additional logging or debugging statements to provide more insights into where the paths might be diverging."
