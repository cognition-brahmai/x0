Is there anyone with experience in using a Python package that can facilitate this functionality?"

        "content": "To implement FTPES (FTP over explicit TLS/SSL) in Python, you can use the `ftplib` module along with the `ssl` module to establish an explicit secure connection. However, a more straightforward approach is to use the `ftplib` extension from the `pyftpdlib` package, which provides a higher-level FTP server and client with SSL/TLS support. Alternatively, you can use the `ftpretty` library, which simplifies the process even further.\n\nHere's an example using `ftpretty`, which is easy to use for FTPES:\n\n1. First, you need to install the `ftpretty` library:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install ftpretty\n   ```\n\n2. Then, you can use the following code to connect to an FTPES server:\n\n   ```python\n   from ftpretty import ftpretty\n\n   # Replace these with your server details\n   host = 'ftp.example.com'\n   user = 'username'\n   password = 'password'\n\n   # Create an ftpretty object with TLS enabled\n   ftp = ftpretty(host, user, password, secure=True)\n\n   # List files in the root directory\n   files = ftp.list('/')\n\n   # Print the list of files\n   for file in files:\n       print(file)\n\n   # Example of downloading a file\n   ftp.get('/remote/path/to/file.txt', 'local/path/to/file.txt')\n\n   # Example of uploading a file\n   ftp.put('local/path/to/file.txt', '/remote/path/to/file.txt')\n\n   # Close the connection\n   ftp.close()\n   ```\n\nThis example demonstrates how to connect, list files, download, and upload files using FTPES. Ensure that you replace the placeholders with your actual FTP server details. The `secure=True` parameter in `ftpretty` enables the explicit TLS/SSL connection.\n\nIf you need more control over the connection or want to use a different library, you can also explore `ftplib` with `ssl`. However, `ftpretty` provides a streamlined interface that handles many of the complexities for you."
