According to the course, gradient descent should converge. I'm using Linear regression from scikit-learn and I noticed that it doesn't provide gradient descent information. I have seen many questions on StackOverflow regarding the implementation of linear regression with gradient descent. So, my question is, how do we use Linear regression from scikit-learn in real world? Or, why doesn't scikit-learn provide gradient descent information in linear regression output?"

Linear regression is one of the foundational techniques in machine learning, and understanding it is crucial for building more complex models.\n\n### Using Linear Regression from Scikit-learn in the Real World:\n\n1. **Model Training**: \n   - Scikit-learn\u2019s `LinearRegression` class is designed to provide a straightforward interface for fitting a linear model to your data. It uses the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method to find the best-fitting line, which is a closed-form solution and doesn\u2019t involve iterative processes like gradient descent.\n   - In practice, you would use this model to fit your data and make predictions, leveraging its simplicity and efficiency.\n\n2. **Handling Multiple Variables**:\n   - Scikit-learn's linear regression can handle multiple variables (features) effortlessly. You simply need to provide it with a matrix of input features and it computes the weights for you.\n\n3. **Preprocessing**:\n   - In real-world applications, preprocessing your data (e.g., scaling, encoding categorical variables) is crucial for the performance of the linear model.\n\n### Why Scikit-learn Doesn\u2019t Provide Gradient Descent Information:\n\n1. **Efficiency**:\n   - OLS is very efficient for linear regression. It provides a direct solution without the need for iterative optimization methods like gradient descent, which can be slower and require tuning of hyperparameters like learning rate.\n\n2. **Simplicity**:\n   - Scikit-learn aims to provide simple, efficient tools for data analysis. By using OLS for linear regression, it avoids the complexities and potential pitfalls of gradient descent, such as convergence issues or sensitivity to initial starting points.\n\n3. **Gradient Descent Use Cases**:\n   - Gradient descent is more commonly associated with training models where closed-form solutions are not available, such as logistic regression, neural networks, or large-scale linear regression problems where data does not fit into memory.\n\n### If You Need Gradient Descent:\n\n- If you specifically want to experiment with gradient descent for linear regression, you can implement it manually or use libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, which provide more flexibility and control over the optimization process.\n\n- Additionally, Scikit-learn offers `SGDRegressor` for linear models trained with gradient descent, which is particularly useful when dealing with very large datasets.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- In summary, scikit-learn's `LinearRegression` is practical for most standard use cases due to its simplicity and efficiency with OLS. However, if your interest or problem domain requires gradient descent, there are other tools and libraries that can accommodate that need. Keep exploring and experimenting with different methods to find what best suits your projects!"
