I want to develop a simple Python client using Qt to reuse some APIs developed with web.py. I have PyQt4 installed globally on my Python2.6 directory. If I don't use the --no-site--packages option, Virtualenv correctly includes PyQt4 in my new sandbox, but with all the global packages that I don't need. Can I prepare a new sandbox with the --no-site--packages option and then add PyQt4 or PySide using pip, easy_install, or some other method?"

        "content": "Yes, it is possible to add PyQt4 or PySide to a virtual environment even when using the `--no-site-packages` option. Here's how you can do it:\n\n### Using PyQt4\n\n1. **Install PyQt4 Globally**: Since you already have PyQt4 installed globally, you can copy the PyQt4 installation files into your virtual environment.\n\n2. **Copy PyQt4 to Virtualenv**:\n   - Locate your global PyQt4 installation directory. This is usually found in your Python site-packages directory.\n   - Copy the `PyQt4` directory from the global site-packages to the `site-packages` directory of your virtual environment.\n\n3. **Copy sip.pyd or sip.so**:\n   - You also need to copy the `sip` module, which might be named something like `sip.pyd` on Windows or `sip.so` on Linux.\n   - Find this file in your global installation and copy it to the same location in your virtual environment's `site-packages`.\n\n### Using PySide\n\n1. **Install PySide via Pip**:\n   - PySide is available on PyPI, and you can install it directly into your virtual environment using pip:\n     ```bash\n     pip install PySide\n     ```\n\n2. **Verify Installation**:\n   - Once installed, you can verify the installation by running a simple script to create a PySide application.\n\n### General Steps After Installation\n\n1. **Verify the Installation**:\n   - Create a simple test script to ensure that PyQt4 or PySide is correctly installed and working in your virtual environment.\n\n2. **Troubleshoot**:\n   - If you encounter any issues, ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed and that there are no conflicting packages.\n\nBy following these steps, you can use PyQt4 or PySide in your virtual environment while keeping it isolated from other global packages."
