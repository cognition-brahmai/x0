I am receiving numerous warnings saying \"Cannot find reference 'xxx' in __init__.py\". For instance, in my `FiltersController.py`, I have this piece of code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy.random as npr\n\nbootstrap = npr.choice(image_base.data[max(0, x-2):x+3, max(0, y-2):y+3].flatten(), size=(3, 3), replace=True)\n```\n\nAnd this warning pops up: \"Cannot find reference 'choice' in __init__.py\". I'm not sure what this means and what I should do to code properly in Python. Can you help me understand and resolve this warning?"

        "content": "The warning you are encountering, \"Cannot find reference 'xxx' in `__init__.py`,\" typically arises from how PyCharm tries to resolve symbols in your project. Here are a few points and steps you can take to resolve or suppress these warnings:\n\n### Understanding the Warning\n\n1. **Namespace Resolution**: In Python, the `__init__.py` files are used to mark directories on disk as Python package directories and are often utilized to initialize a package's namespace. When PyCharm cannot resolve a reference, it might suggest that it expects to find that reference in an `__init__.py` file, especially when dealing with packages and sub-packages.\n\n2. **Static Analysis**: PyCharm uses static analysis to check for errors and warnings. It might not always correctly resolve certain imports, especially if you're using dynamic imports or complex package structures.\n\n### Steps to Resolve the Warning\n\n1. **Ensure Correct Imports**: Double-check that your import statements are correctly specified. In your case, the import statement for `numpy.random` seems correct, so this might not be the issue, but it's a good practice to verify.\n\n2. **Check Package Structure**: \n   - Ensure that the directory structure matches the package hierarchy. Each directory that should be treated as a package should contain an `__init__.py` file, even if it's empty.\n   - If you're using relative imports within your packages, ensure they are set up correctly.\n\n3. **Invalidate Caches**: Sometimes, PyCharm's caches might become outdated or incorrect. You can invalidate caches by going to `File > Invalidate Caches / Restart` in PyCharm and choose to invalidate and restart.\n\n4. **Suppress Warnings**: If the warning is not affecting the functionality of your code, you can choose to suppress it:\n   - You can right-click on the warning in PyCharm and choose to suppress it for that file or for the whole project.\n\n5. **Update PyCharm**: Ensure you're using the latest version of PyCharm, as updates might fix issues with static analysis or warnings.\n\n6. **Configure Project Structure**:\n   - Go to `File > Project Structure` in PyCharm and ensure that the source roots and package roots are correctly set.\n   - Make sure your `Sources` directory is marked as a source root if it's not already.\n\n7. **Check for Typing Issues**: If your project uses type hints and typings, make sure they are correctly specified, as PyCharm might rely on them for resolving references.\n\nIf after following these steps the warning persists and does not impact the execution of your code, it might be a false positive from PyCharm's static analysis, in which case you can safely ignore it."
