For instance, I have a script with two functions: `sum_numbers` and `print_sum` as shown below:\n\n```python\ndef sum_numbers(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\ndef print_sum(a, b):\n    print(sum_numbers(a, b))\n```\nWill the script still work if I declare the `print_sum` function before `sum_numbers`? Is this behavior consistent across all scenarios?"

        "content": "In Python, the sequence in which functions are defined in a script does not impact the functionality, as long as the functions are called after they are defined. Python requires that functions be defined before they are called, but the order of definitions themselves does not matter as long as they are not invoked before their definition.\n\nIn your example, the script will still work if you declare the `print_sum` function before `sum_numbers`, like this:\n\n```python\ndef print_sum(a, b):\n    print(sum_numbers(a, b))\n\ndef sum_numbers(a, b):\n    return a + b\n```\n\nThis is because even though `print_sum` is defined before `sum_numbers`, it does not invoke `sum_numbers` until it is called. As long as `sum_numbers` is defined by the time `print_sum` is invoked, the script will execute without issues. The key point is that the function `sum_numbers` must be defined before `print_sum` is actually executed, which typically means before it is called at runtime.\n\nThis behavior is consistent across all scenarios in Python. The crucial requirement is that any function used within another function must be defined before it is invoked at runtime."
