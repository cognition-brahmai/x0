        "content": "To resolve the issue of setting Python 3.8 as the default version on your Mac, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Ensure Python 3.8 is Installed:**\n   First, make sure Python 3.8 is indeed installed using Homebrew. From your output, it seems like `python@3.8` is installed, but you should verify it:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew info python@3.8\n   ```\n\n   If it's not installed, you can install it using:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew install python@3.8\n   ```\n\n2. **Link Python 3.8:**\n   You need to link Python 3.8 to make it the default `python3` version:\n\n   ```bash\n   brew unlink python\n   brew link --overwrite --force python@3.8\n   ```\n\n   This command forces Homebrew to use Python 3.8 as the default version.\n\n3. **Check the Version:**\n   After linking, check the Python version again:\n\n   ```bash\n   python3 --version\n   ```\n\n   It should now display Python 3.8.x.\n\n4. **Update the PATH:**\n   Make sure your PATH is set up correctly in your shell configuration file (like `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, etc.), so that the newly installed Python is prioritized. Add the following line to your configuration file:\n\n   ```bash\n   export PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/python@3.8/bin:$PATH\"\n   ```\n\n   Then, reload your shell:\n\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bash_profile\n   # or\n   source ~/.zshrc\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify Installation:**\n   Finally, verify that the correct Python 3.8 is being used:\n\n   ```bash\n   which python3\n   ```\n\n   It should point to the Homebrew location, something like `/usr/local/opt/python@3.8/bin/python3`.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to set Python 3.8 as the default version on your Mac."
