        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the way Python interprets numbers with leading zeros. In Python 2, a number with a leading zero is interpreted as an octal (base-8) number, which only allows digits 0-7. However, in Python 3, numbers with leading zeros are not allowed and will result in a `SyntaxError`, as you've experienced.\n\nIn your code, the problematic line is:\n\n```python\ndatetime.datetime(2012,05,22,09,03,41)\n```\n\nHere, `09` is not a valid octal number because the digit 9 is not allowed in base-8. To fix this, you should remove the leading zero:\n\n```python\ndatetime.datetime(2012, 5, 22, 9, 3, 41)\n```\n\nThis will correct the error since it treats all numbers as decimal (base-10) values. Ensure you apply this change wherever you have leading zeros in your code."
