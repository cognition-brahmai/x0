However, the score is written in a language that only your musicians can understand, using a combination of symbols, gestures, and even smells. To make matters more complicated, the score contains hidden cues and codes that will change the music in unpredictable ways. As the conductor, it is up to you to decipher these cues and communicate them to your musicians in a way that allows them to perform the piece to its fullest potential. Can you think of any other examples where decoding and interpreting hidden language is crucial for success?"
