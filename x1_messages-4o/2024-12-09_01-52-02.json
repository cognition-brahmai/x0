I've read the Python documentation on weak references but I'm still not quite clear on their function and application. Can you provide a simple example and explanation of how they work? I've tried using Thomas's code, but when I replace obj with [1,2,3], I encounter an error. The code and error message are provided below:\n\n```python\nr = weakref.ref(obj)\n```\n\nAnd the error message that I receive is:\n\n```python\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"C:/Users/nonya/Desktop/test.py\", line 9, in &lt;module&gt;\nr = weakref.ref(obj)\nTypeError: cannot create weak reference to 'list' object\n```"

        "content": "Certainly! Weak references in Python are a way to reference an object without preventing it from being garbage collected. They are particularly useful in caching scenarios where you want to hold a reference to an object without preventing it from being freed when it's no longer in use elsewhere.\n\nHowever, not all objects in Python can be weakly referenced. Only objects that are instances of classes that have a `__weakref__` slot can be weakly referenced. This typically includes user-defined classes and some built-in types, but not mutable types like lists or dictionaries.\n\nWhen you attempted to create a weak reference to a list object, you encountered a `TypeError` because lists do not support weak references. Let's go through a simple example using a custom class that does support weak references:\n\n```python\nimport weakref\n\nclass MyClass:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n\n# Create an instance of MyClass\nobj = MyClass(\"example\")\n\n# Create a weak reference to the obj\nr = weakref.ref(obj)\n\n# Access the object through the weak reference\nprint(r())  # Output: <__main__.MyClass object at 0x...>\n\n# Delete the original strong reference\ndel obj\n\n# Now the weak reference should return None, since the object may have been garbage collected\nprint(r())  # Output: None\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **MyClass**: We define a simple class `MyClass` with an `__init__` method to store a name.\n\n2. **Creating an instance**: We create an instance of `MyClass` and assign it to `obj`.\n\n3. **Weak reference**: We create a weak reference to `obj` using `weakref.ref(obj)`. The `r` variable holds a weak reference to the original object.\n\n4. **Accessing the object**: You can access the object through the weak reference by calling `r()`. If the object is still alive, it returns the object; otherwise, it returns `None`.\n\n5. **Deleting the strong reference**: When you delete `obj`, the original object might be garbage collected if there are no other strong references to it. The weak reference `r` now returns `None`.\n\nIf you need to use weak references with lists or dictionaries, you can wrap them in a custom class that supports weak references, allowing you to still benefit from weak referencing. \n\nIf you have further questions or need more examples, feel free to ask!"
