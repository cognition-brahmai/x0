        "content": "Sure! Here\u2019s a classification of each statement with reasoning:\n\n1. **The circumference of a circle is equal to twice its radius multiplied by pi.**\n   - **Classification:** Fact\n   - **Justification:** This statement is based on a mathematical formula, \\( C = 2\\pi r \\), where \\( C \\) is the circumference and \\( r \\) is the radius. This formula is universally accepted and applies consistently to all circles.\n\n2. **Dogs are better pets than cats.**\n   - **Classification:** Opinion\n   - **Justification:** This statement expresses a preference and is subjective. What makes a pet \u201cbetter\u201d can vary greatly among individuals based on personal experiences, lifestyle, and values.\n\n3. **The boiling point of water is 100 degrees Celsius.**\n   - **Classification:** Fact\n   - **Justification:** Under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm), the boiling point of water is scientifically measured and accepted as 100 degrees Celsius. This is a consistent and verifiable physical property of water.\n\n4. **The concept of beauty is subjective and varies among individuals.**\n   - **Classification:** Fact\n   - **Justification:** This statement is a widely recognized understanding in fields such as psychology and sociology. While it pertains to subjective experiences, the assertion that beauty is subjective and varies is an objective observation about human perception and cultural differences.\n\n5. **The United States has the largest economy in the world.**\n   - **Classification:** Fact\n   - **Justification:** Based on economic data such as GDP, the United States is currently considered to have the largest economy in the world.
