I have been successful in creating it with the following code:\n\n```\nlist1 = []\nlist2 = []\nresults = [list1, list2]\n```\nHowever, I am wondering if there is a quicker way to achieve this in a single line. I tried the following code, but it didn't work:\n\n```\nresult = [list1[], list2[]]\n```\nAdditionally, would having it on one line make any difference in terms of complexity? Would it be considered as three assignments in either case?"

        "content": "To create a list containing multiple empty lists in a single line, you can use list comprehension or simply initialize the empty lists directly within the list. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nresults = [[], []]\n```\n\nThis code effectively creates a list named `results` that contains two empty lists. \n\nRegarding the complexity and assignments:\n- Both approaches, whether you use multiple lines or a single line, will have the same time complexity. The creation of empty lists is a constant time operation, \\(O(1)\\), and the list containing them is also created in constant time.\n- In terms of assignments, the single-line version is more concise but doesn't inherently change the number of underlying operations performed by Python. It still involves creating two empty list objects and then placing them into another list.\n\nOverall, using a single line is more about improving readability and conciseness of the code rather than affecting performance or complexity in this particular case."
