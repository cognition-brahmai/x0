        "content": "The presence of impurities and dissolved salts in water affects its physical properties, including its boiling point, primarily through a phenomenon known as \"boiling point elevation.\" This is a colligative property, meaning it depends on the number of particles in a solution, not the type of particles. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Hydrogen Bonding:** In pure water, hydrogen bonding between water molecules is relatively strong. When impurities or dissolved salts are introduced, they disrupt these hydrogen bonds, requiring more energy (higher temperature) to break them and transition the water from liquid to gas.\n\n2. **Boiling Point Elevation:** Impurities and dissolved salts increase the boiling point of water because they lower the water's vapor pressure. More energy (heat) is required to allow the vapor pressure of the water to equal the atmospheric pressure, thus increasing the boiling point.\n\n### Comparison of Boiling Points\n\nBelow is a table that provides a comparison of the boiling points of pure water and water with varying concentrations of dissolved salts at different atmospheric pressures. Note that these values are illustrative; actual experimental values depend on specific conditions.\n\n| Atmospheric Pressure (atm) | Pure Water (\u00b0C) | 1% NaCl Solution (\u00b0C) | 5% NaCl Solution (\u00b0C) | 10% NaCl Solution (\u00b0C) |\n|----------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|\n| 1.0                        | 100.0           | 100.5                 | 102.5                 | 105.0                  |\n| 0.9                        | 95.2            | 95.7                  | 97.6                  | 100.0                  |\n| 0.8                        | 91.0            | 91.5                  | 93.4                  | 95.5                   |\n| 0.7                        | 87.3            | 87.8                  | 89.6                  | 91.7                   |\n\n### Mathematical Model\n\nThe boiling point elevation can be estimated using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta T_b = i \\cdot K_b \\cdot m\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\Delta T_b\\) is the boiling point elevation (\u00b0C).\n- \\(i\\) is the van't Hoff factor (which depends on the degree of dissociation of the solute, e.g., for NaCl, \\(i \\approx 2\\)).\n- \\(K_b\\) is the ebullioscopic constant of the solvent (for water, \\(K_b = 0.512 \\, \\text{\u00b0C kg/mol}\\)).\n- \\(m\\) is the molality of the solution (moles of solute per kilogram of solvent).\n\nThe new boiling point (\\(T_{b, \\text{solution}}\\)) can be calculated as:\n\n\\[\nT_{b, \\text{solution}} = T_{b, \\text{pure}} + \\Delta T_b\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(T_{b, \\text{pure}}\\) is the boiling point of pure water at the given atmospheric pressure.\n\nThis model assumes ideal behavior, which may not hold perfectly in all real-world solutions due to interactions between solute and solvent particles.\n\nFor more accurate predictions, especially at higher concentrations, empirical data and corrections for non-ideal behavior (activity coefficients) are necessary."
