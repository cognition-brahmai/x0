I'm currently trying to build a simple API in Flask where the first step is to get the POST json data and print it. My current code is shown below, and when I make a request to /api with json data, I'm receiving a 500 error. I'm not sure why this is happening. Can someone help me understand and fix this issue?\n\nThe code I am using is:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, Response\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef root_response():\n    return \"Hello World.\"\n\n@app.route('/api', methods=['POST', 'GET'])\ndef api_response():\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        return request.json\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run()\n```\n\nI am making a curl command as follows:\n\n```bash\n$ curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" --data @body.json http://127.0.0.1:5000/api\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN\">\n<title>500 Internal Server Error</title>\n<h1>Internal Server Error</h1>\n<p>The server encountered an internal error and was unable to complete your request.  Either the server is overloaded or there is an error in the application.</p>\n```\n\nAnd my body.json file contains:\n\n```json\n{\n\"please\": \"print\",\n\"me\": \"now\"\n}\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is that the `api_response` function is trying to return a JSON object directly, but Flask expects a response object or a string. To resolve this, you need to convert the JSON data to a string or use Flask's `jsonify` function, which is specifically designed for returning JSON responses.\n\nHere's the updated code using `jsonify`:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, request, jsonify\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef root_response():\n    return \"Hello World.\"\n\n@app.route('/api', methods=['POST', 'GET'])\ndef api_response():\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        # Ensure the JSON data is present and return it using jsonify\n        data = request.json\n        return jsonify(data)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run()\n```\n\nWith this change, when you make a POST request with your JSON data, Flask will properly format the response as JSON. You should now see a successful response instead of a 500 error.\n\nAdditionally, make sure that your Flask server is running and accessible before you make the curl request, and ensure there are no typos or issues in your `body.json` file."
