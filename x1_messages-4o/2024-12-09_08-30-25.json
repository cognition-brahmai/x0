However, this cosine similarity does not meet the requirements to be a mathematical distance metric as it doesn't satisfy the triangle inequality. I aim to cluster these objects in a way that groups similar items together but I do not want to specify the number of clusters beforehand. Is there an algorithm that can do this and does not require a distance metric and a pre-specified number of clusters?"

        "content": "Yes, there are clustering algorithms that can handle the situation you're describing, where you have a similarity measure (like cosine similarity) and you don't want to specify the number of clusters beforehand. Some popular options include:\n\n1. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):** DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that does not require specifying the number of clusters beforehand. It works by identifying dense regions in the data and can handle arbitrary shapes of clusters. Although it traditionally uses a distance metric, it can be adapted to work with cosine similarity by considering it as a measure of density.\n\n2. **OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure):** Similar to DBSCAN, OPTICS doesn't require a pre-defined number of clusters and is designed to identify cluster structures at different density levels. It generates an ordering of the dataset that captures its density-based clustering structure, which can be useful for visualizing the clustering and identifying clusters at different scales.\n\n3. **Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative or Divisive):** Hierarchical clustering builds a tree (dendrogram) of clusters. It doesn't require specifying the number of clusters in advance and can work with a similarity measure like cosine similarity. You can cut the dendrogram at different levels to obtain different numbers of clusters.\n\n4. **Affinity Propagation:** This algorithm identifies exemplars among the data points and forms clusters of data points around these exemplars. It uses a similarity matrix and does not require specifying the number of clusters. However, it does require setting a preference parameter that influences the number of clusters.\n\nEach of these methods has its strengths and considerations, so the choice of algorithm may depend on the specific characteristics of your dataset and the desired properties of your clustering. You may need to experiment with different algorithms to see which one best suits your needs."
