        "content": "The \"Too many ancestors\" warning from Pylint indicates that a class has more base classes (or ancestors) than a specified limit. This limit is intended to prevent overly complex class hierarchies, which can be difficult to understand and maintain. The warning is often triggered when a class directly or indirectly inherits from multiple classes.\n\nIn your case, the `ExtendedRegisterForm` class inherits from `RegisterForm`, which itself likely inherits from multiple classes in the `flask_security.forms` module. This results in a deep inheritance chain, exceeding Pylint's default limit of 7 ancestors.\n\nTo address this warning, you have a few options:\n\n1. **Understand the Inheritance Chain**: First, investigate the ancestry of `RegisterForm` to understand why it has so many ancestors. This can help you decide if the deep inheritance is necessary or if it can be simplified.\n\n2. **Refactor the Code**: If the class hierarchy is indeed too complex, consider refactoring it. This might involve breaking down responsibilities into smaller, more manageable classes or using composition instead of inheritance.\n\n3. **Increase the Limit**: If you believe the current structure is justified, you can increase the limit for this specific warning. This can be done by adding or modifying the `.pylintrc` configuration file or by using the `--max-parents` command-line option when running Pylint. For example:\n   ```shell\n   pylint --max-parents=10 example.py\n   ```\n   Or, you can adjust the setting in the `.pylintrc` file:\n   ```ini\n   [DESIGN]\n   max-parents=10\n   ```\n\n4. **Suppress the Warning**: If you are sure that the design is appropriate and don't want to adjust the limit globally, you can suppress the warning for this specific class by adding a comment:\n   ```python\n   class ExtendedRegisterForm(RegisterForm):  # pylint: disable=too-many-ancestors\n       '''An extended register form'''\n       name = TextField('Name', [])\n   ```\n\nEach approach has its trade-offs, so choose the one that best fits your project's needs and coding standards."
