Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n1. **Import the `os` module**:\n   First, you need to import the `os` module which provides a way to use operating system-dependent functionality like changing the working directory.\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   ```\n\n2. **Check the current working directory**:\n   You can check your current working directory using `os.getcwd()`.\n\n   ```python\n   current_directory = os.getcwd()\n   print(f\"Current working directory: {current_directory}\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Change the working directory**:\n   Use `os.chdir()` to change the working directory to the desired path where your CSV file is located.\n\n   ```python\n   os.chdir('/path/to/your/directory')\n   ```\n\n   Replace `'/path/to/your/directory'` with the actual path to the directory where your CSV file is located.\n\n4. **Verify the change**:\n   Again, you can verify if the directory has been changed using `os.getcwd()`.\n\n   ```python\n   new_directory = os.getcwd()\n   print(f\"New working directory: {new_directory}\")\n   ```\n\nAfter changing the working directory, you should be able to use `pd.read_csv()` without specifying the full path to the CSV file, just by using the file name if it's in the current working directory.\n\nHere's a complete example:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Check current working directory\nprint(\"Current working directory:\", os.getcwd())\n\n# Change the working directory\nos.chdir('/path/to/your/directory')\n\n# Verify the change\nprint(\"New working directory:\", os.getcwd())\n\n# Read CSV file\ndata = pd.read_csv('your_file.csv')\nprint(data.head())\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `'/path/to/your/directory'` and `'your_file.csv'` with your actual directory path and file name."
