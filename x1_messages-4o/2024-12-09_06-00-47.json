        "content": "How does Python's \"super\" function work in the context of a diamond class hierarchy using multiple inheritance? I have created an object of the most derived class and Python calls the constructor for the most derived class, then its parent classes as listed from left to right, and then the grandparent. I am aware of Python's Method Resolution Order (MRO), but I am curious about how the object returned from \"super\" manages to communicate to calls of \"super\" in the parent classes the correct order. For example, in the following code:\n\n```python\nclass A(object):\n    def __init__(self): print \"A init\"\n\nclass B(A):\n    def __init__(self):\n        print \"B init\"\n        super(B, self).__init__()\n\nclass C(A):\n    def __init__(self):\n        print \"C init\"\n        super(C, self).__init__()\n\nclass D(B, C):\n    def __init__(self):\n        print \"D init\"\n        super(D, self).__init__()\n\nx = D()\n```\n\nThe code prints:\n```\nD init\nB init\nC init\nA init\n```\n\nHowever, if I comment out the call to \"super\" in B's init function, neither A nor C's init function is called. This means B's call to \"super\" is somehow aware of C's existence in the overall class hierarchy. How does the object returned by \"super\" in D's init definition communicate the existence of C to the object returned by \"super\" in B's init definition? Is the information that subsequent calls of \"super\" use stored on the object itself? If so, why isn't \"super\" instead \"self.super\"?\n\nAdditionally, it has been pointed out that it's not \"self.super\" because \"super\" is an attribute of the class, not an instance of the class. This conceptually makes sense, but in practice \"super\" isn't an attribute of the class either. You can test this in the interpreter by making two classes A and B, where B inherits from A, and calling `dir(B)`. It has no `super` or `__super__` attributes."

        "content": "In Python, the `super` function is a built-in that provides a way to call methods from a superclass in a way that is aware of the Method Resolution Order (MRO). This is particularly useful in complex inheritance hierarchies like the diamond problem you've described, where you want to ensure that each class in the hierarchy has its methods called in the correct order.\n\n### How `super` Works with MRO\n\nWhen you create an instance of class `D`, the MRO ensures that the `__init__` methods are called in the correct order. The MRO for class `D` is `[D, B, C, A, object]`. This means that when you call `super(D, self).__init__()` in `D`, it starts looking for the next class in the MRO after `D`, which is `B`.\n\n1. **`D`'s `__init__`**: Calls `super(D, self).__init__()`, which according to the MRO, moves to `B`.\n\n2. **`B`'s `__init__`**: Calls `super(B, self).__init__()`, which moves to `C` because `C` is next in the MRO after `B`.\n\n3. **`C`'s `__init__`**: Calls `super(C, self).__init__()`, which moves to `A` because `A` is next in the MRO after `C`.\n\n4. **`A`'s `__init__`**: This is the base class, and it gets called last.\n\nThe `super` function doesn't store information on the object itself, but rather uses the class hierarchy and the current instance to determine the next class in the MRO. It knows the current position in the MRO and simply moves to the next one.\n\n### Why Not `self.super`?\n\n`super` is not an attribute of the class or the instance. It's a Python mechanism that dynamically determines the next class in the MRO. When you call `super()`, it creates a temporary object of type `super`, which is used to access the next method in the MRO.\n\nThe reason you don't see `super` in `dir(B)` is because `super` is not a persistent attribute of any class. It's a built-in function that returns a temporary object that knows about the MRO for the given context.\n\n### Why Commenting Out `super` in `B` Affects Other Calls\n\nWhen you comment out `super(B, self).__init__()` in `B`, you effectively stop the chain of method calls in the MRO. The MRO traversal relies on each class in the hierarchy calling `super()` to continue to the next class. If one class in the chain doesn't call `super()`, the chain is broken, and the remaining classes in the MRO are not initialized.\n\n### Summary\n\n- **`super()`**: Provides a way to call the next method in the MRO.\n- **MRO**: Determines the order in which classes are initialized.\n- **Not an Attribute**: `super` is a built-in function, not an attribute of a class or instance.\n- **Chain of Calls**: Each class must call `super()` to ensure all relevant methods in the MRO are executed.\n\nBy using `super()`, you can ensure that all classes in a multiple inheritance hierarchy are properly initialized, respecting the order defined by the MRO."
