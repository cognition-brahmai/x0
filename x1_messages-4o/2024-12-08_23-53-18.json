        "content": "To prepare a dataset in Ruby for analysis, you would typically follow a series of steps such as loading the data, cleaning it, handling missing values, and possibly transforming or normalizing the data depending on your analysis needs. Let's go through these steps with an example using your provided dataset and handle missing values.\n\n### Step 1: Load the Data\n\nYou've already loaded the data from a CSV file using the `CSV` library in Ruby. Here's a quick recap of how you might do this:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'csv'\n\ndata = CSV.parse(File.read('data.csv'), headers: true)\n```\n\n### Step 2: Explore the Data\n\nYou might want to inspect the data to understand its structure:\n\n```ruby\ndata.each do |row|\n  puts row.to_h\nend\n```\n\n### Step 3: Handle Missing Values\n\nTo handle missing values, you first need to identify them. Missing values in a CSV loaded with Ruby's `CSV` library often appear as `nil`. You might want to replace them with a default value, remove them, or use some form of imputation.\n\nHere's a method to fill missing values with a default value (e.g., `0` for numerical data or `'Unknown'` for categorical data):\n\n```ruby\ndef handle_missing_values(data, fill_value = 0)\n  data.each do |row|\n    row.each do |field, value|\n      if value.nil? || value.strip.empty?\n        row[field] = fill_value\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n# Example usage\nhandle_missing_values(data, 'Unknown')\n```\n\nYou can customize the `fill_value` depending on the nature of your data (numerical or categorical).\n\n### Step 4: Transform the Data (if necessary)\n\nDepending on your analysis, you might need to normalize or encode the data. For instance, if you need to convert categorical variables into numerical ones, you could use simple mappings:\n\n```ruby\ndef encode_categorical(data, column, mapping)\n  data.each do |row|\n    row[column] = mapping[row[column]] if mapping.key?(row[column])\n  end\nend\n\n# Example usage\ngender_mapping = {'Male' => 1, 'Female' => 0}\nencode_categorical(data, 'Gender', gender_mapping)\n```\n\n### Step 5: Analyze or Export the Data\n\nAfter preparing the data, you can proceed with your analysis or export the cleaned data for use in other tools:\n\n```ruby\nCSV.open('cleaned_data.csv', 'wb') do |csv|\n  csv << data.headers\n  data.each do |row|\n    csv << row\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThis is a basic outline for preparing a dataset in Ruby. Depending on the complexity of your dataset and your analysis requirements, you might need to implement more sophisticated data preprocessing techniques."
