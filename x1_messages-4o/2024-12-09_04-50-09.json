        "content": "The error message \"CUDA error: no kernel image is available for execution on the device\" indicates that there is a mismatch between the CUDA version, the PyTorch build, and your GPU architecture. Here are the steps to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify CUDA Compatibility**: You need to ensure that the PyTorch version you are using is compatible with the CUDA version installed on your system. In your case, you have CUDA 11.1 and are using a PyTorch nightly build (`1.8.0.dev20210115+cu110`). This should work theoretically, but you may need to ensure it was built with support for your GPU architecture (Ampere, compute capability 8.6).\n\n2. **Update NVIDIA Drivers**: Make sure you have the latest NVIDIA drivers installed for your RTX 3090. You are using version 455.38, which might be outdated for CUDA 11.x and RTX 3090. Consider upgrading to a more recent driver version.\n\n3. **Stable PyTorch Release**: Consider using a stable release of PyTorch that explicitly supports CUDA 11.1. As of your setup, PyTorch 1.7.0+ should support CUDA 11.1, but you might want to check the official PyTorch website for the most compatible version.\n\n4. **Install Specific PyTorch Version**: Install a specific version of PyTorch with CUDA support that matches your setup. You can do this via `pip` or `conda`. For instance, using `pip`:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install torch==1.7.1+cu110 torchvision==0.8.2+cu110 torchaudio==0.7.2 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html\n   ```\n\n   Adjust the version numbers as needed based on the latest stable version available.\n\n5. **Build from Source**: If the pre-built binaries do not work, consider building PyTorch from source with the correct CUDA and compute capability support. This is more involved but ensures compatibility with the latest GPUs.\n\n6. **Check Compute Capability**: Ensure that the CUDA version you are using supports the compute capability of your GPU (8.6 for RTX 3090). You can check this in the CUDA toolkit documentation.\n\n7. **Environment Cleanup**: Sometimes, conflicting installations can cause issues. Consider setting up a new virtual environment and installing PyTorch and CUDA dependencies there to avoid conflicts.\n\nAfter addressing the above steps, try running your code again to see if the issue is resolved."
