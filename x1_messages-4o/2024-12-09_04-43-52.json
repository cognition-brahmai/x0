For example, I want to convert a list like this:\n```python\n[[\"A\", \"B\"], [\"C\", \"D\"]]\n```\ninto a matrix format like this:\n```\nA    B\nC    D\n```\nI have tried using the `pprint` module, but it doesn't seem to fulfill my requirements."

        "content": "To print a 2D list as a 2D matrix in Python, you can use a simple loop to iterate over the rows and print each element with a specified delimiter, such as a space. Here's a basic example:\n\n```python\ndef print_matrix(matrix):\n    for row in matrix:\n        print(\"    \".join(row))\n\nmatrix = [[\"A\", \"B\"], [\"C\", \"D\"]]\nprint_matrix(matrix)\n```\n\nThis function `print_matrix` takes a 2D list `matrix` as an argument and iterates over each row. For each row, it joins the elements with four spaces in between (as shown in your example) and prints the result. You can adjust the delimiter in the `join` method to whatever suits your formatting needs.\n\nThis approach gives you the flexibility to format your matrix in a variety of ways without relying on external libraries or modules."
