However, I am encountering an error - `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'groups'`. Why am I getting this error? The regular expression seems to work fine in TextWrangler. Here's the relevant part of my code:\n```python\nimport re\n\nhtmlString = '&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt; Fine, thank you.&amp;#160;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt; Molt b\u00e9, gr\u00e0cies.

        "content": "The error you're encountering, `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'groups'`, is occurring because the `re.search()` function is returning `None`. This happens when the regular expression pattern you provided does not match any part of the input string.\n\nTo debug this issue, it's important to ensure that your regular expression pattern accurately reflects the structure of your input string. Here are a few steps to help you resolve this:\n\n1. **Escape Characters**: Ensure that you're using the correct escape sequences in your regular expression. For example, in your pattern, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, and `&amp;` are HTML entities and should not have backslashes before them in the regular expression.\n\n2. **Simplify and Test the Regular Expression**: Start with a simpler version of your regular expression to see if it matches any part of the input string. Gradually add more components to your expression until you identify the section causing the issue.\n\n3. **Use Raw String Literals**: It's a good practice to use raw string literals (prefixing the string with `r`) for regular expressions to avoid issues with escape sequences. This makes it easier to read and maintain.\n\n4. **Verify the Pattern**: Make sure that your pattern correctly captures the desired groups. You might need to adjust the parts that capture specific HTML entities or text.\n\nHere's a refined version of your code with a simplified and corrected regular expression pattern:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\nhtmlString = '&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt; Fine, thank you.&amp;#160;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt; Molt b\u00e9, gr\u00e0cies. (&lt;i&gt;mohl behh, GRAH-syuhs&lt;/i&gt;)'\n\n# Simplified and corrected regex pattern\nSearchStr = r'&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt&gt;[^&]+&amp;#160;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt; ([^&]+) \\(&lt;i&gt;([^<]+)&lt;/i&gt;\\)'\n\nResult = re.search(SearchStr, htmlString)\n\nif Result:\n    print(\"Full Match:\", Result.group(0))\n    print(\"Group 1:\", Result.group(1))  # Molt b\u00e9, gr\u00e0cies.\n    print(\"Group 2:\", Result.group(2))  # mohl behh, GRAH-syuhs\nelse:\n    print(\"No match found.\")\n```\n\nIn this version:\n- The pattern `[^&]+` is used to match sequences of characters that do not include an ampersand, which helps avoid the need for overly complex character classes.\n- The pattern captures the two groups you are interested in: the translated text and the phonetic pronunciation.\n- The use of `r''` indicates a raw string, which simplifies handling backslashes.\n\nAdjust the regular expression further if needed to better match your specific use case."
