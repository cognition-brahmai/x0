I made slight changes to the source code, bumped to a new version and ran the command `python setup.py sdist upload` in the shell. However, I received the following error message: `Submitting dist/...-0.2.2.tar.gz to http://pypi.python.org/pypi Upload failed (403): You are not allowed to edit '...' package information`. I have verified that my ~/.pypirc information is correct as I have already resolved the \"must be authenticated\" issue before. Is this issue a side-effect of a fresh registration as I just created the account on PyPI today?"

        "content": "The error message you are encountering typically indicates a permissions issue with uploading the new version of your package to PyPI. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Your PyPI Username and Password:** Make sure that your credentials in the `~/.pypirc` file are correct and correspond to the account that has ownership or maintainer rights to the package you are trying to upload.\n\n2. **Verify Ownership/Maintainership:** Ensure that the PyPI account you are using to upload the package is listed as the owner or maintainer of the package. You can check this by visiting the package page on PyPI and looking at the \"Maintainers\" section.\n\n3. **Use Twine for Uploading:** It is recommended to use `twine` instead of `python setup.py upload` for uploading packages, as `twine` handles authentication and uploads more securely and effectively. Try using the following commands:\n   ```bash\n   python setup.py sdist\n   twine upload dist/*\n   ```\n\n4. **Check PyPI's Status:** Occasionally, PyPI may have temporary issues or restrictions, especially for newly created accounts or packages. Check if there are any announcements or known issues on PyPI's status page or forums.\n\n5. **Verify the Package Name:** Ensure that there is no conflict with the package name or version number. Sometimes, if a package with the same name already exists and you do not have permissions for it, you may encounter errors.\n\n6. **Review PyPI's Policies:** PyPI may have specific policies for new users or newly registered packages that could affect your ability to upload. Familiarize yourself with these policies.\n\n7. **Contact PyPI Support:** If none of the above solutions work, consider contacting PyPI support for assistance. They may be able to provide more specific insights or resolve any account-related issues.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the issue preventing your package upload."
