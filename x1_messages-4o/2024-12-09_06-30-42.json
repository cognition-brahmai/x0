Here is a sample code which I used to understand the behavior of these operators:\n\n```python\na = 2, b = 3\n>>> a != b\nTrue\n>>> a <> b\nTrue\n>>> b = 2\n>>> a != b\nFalse\n>>> a <> b\nFalse\n```\nBased on the output, it seems both operators behave in the same way. Can someone explain if there is any difference and how they work?"

        "content": "In Python, both `!=` and `<>` were used as inequality operators, and they indeed served the same purpose in older versions of Python (specifically in Python 2). They were used to check if two values are not equal to each other.\n\nHowever, there are important distinctions to note:\n\n1. **Python 2 vs Python 3**: \n   - In Python 2, both `!=` and `<>` could be used interchangeably to test inequality.\n   - In Python 3, the `<>` operator has been removed, and `!=` is the only valid inequality operator.\n\n2. **Code Compatibility**: \n   - If you are maintaining legacy Python 2 code, you might encounter the `<>` operator. However, if you are writing new code or maintaining code that should run on Python 3, you should use `!=` exclusively.\n\n3. **Syntax Error in Python 3**: \n   - Using `<>` in Python 3 will result in a syntax error as it is not recognized as a valid operator.\n\nIn your example code, it seems there was a mistake in variable assignment (missing `=`) and your example implies that both operators behaved the same, which is true for Python 2. However, for modern Python development, you should use `!=`.\n\nHere's a corrected version of your Python code that will work in both Python 2 and 3 (note the valid assignment syntax):\n\n```python\na = 2\nb = 3\n\n# In Python 2, both operators will work:\nprint(a != b)  # True\nprint(a <> b)  # True, but only in Python 2\n\nb = 2\nprint(a != b)  # False\n# print(a <> b)  # This will give a syntax error in Python 3\n```\n\nFor future-proof code, always use `!=`."
