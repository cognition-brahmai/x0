Here's the error stack trace:\n\n<pre><code>\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"C:\\Python25\\Lib\\site-packages\\django\\bin\\django-admin.py\", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;\n    from django.core import management\nImportError: No module named django.core\n</code></pre>"

        "content": "The error you're experiencing is likely due to Django not being installed correctly or the Python environment not recognizing the Django package. Here are steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify Django Installation:**\n   - First, ensure that Django is installed correctly. You can do this by running the following command in your command prompt or terminal:\n     ```bash\n     pip list\n     ```\n   - Look for Django in the list. If it's not there, you'll need to install it.\n\n2. **Install/Reinstall Django:**\n   - If Django is not installed, or if you're unsure about the installation, you can install or reinstall Django using pip:\n     ```bash\n     pip install django==1.0.2\n     ```\n   - Note: Django 1.0.2 is quite old, and it's recommended to use a more recent version unless you have specific reasons to use 1.0.2.\n\n3. **Check Python Environment:**\n   - Ensure that your Python environment is set up correctly. You might be using a different Python version or virtual environment. Make sure you activate the correct virtual environment if you're using one.\n\n4. **Verify PYTHONPATH:**\n   - It's possible that your `PYTHONPATH` is not set correctly, preventing Python from locating the Django package. Ensure that `PYTHONPATH` includes the directory where Django is installed.\n\n5. **Check Script Location:**\n   - Make sure you are running the correct `django-admin.py` script. Sometimes, there might be multiple versions or incorrect paths being referenced. Use the full path to run the command if necessary.\n\n6. **Use django-admin Instead:**\n   - As of later versions, Django uses `django-admin` instead of `django-admin.py`. Try running:\n     ```bash\n     django-admin --version\n     ```\n   - This will help you confirm whether Django is installed and accessible.\n\n7. **Consider Using Virtual Environments:**\n   - If you aren't already, consider using virtual environments to manage your Python packages. This can help avoid path and version conflicts.\n\n8. **Check for Multiple Python Installations:**\n   - Ensure that you don't have multiple Python installations that might be conflicting. The version of Python you are using should have Django installed.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, you may want to consider upgrading to a newer version of Django, if possible, as older versions may have compatibility issues with newer system configurations."
