I am aware that mininet-wifi uses python 2 instead of python 3. I have tried to download python-pip using the command:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install python-pip\n```\n\nBut that also leads to the same error: \n\n```bash\nE: Unable to locate package python-pip\n```\n\nHow can I resolve this issue?"
