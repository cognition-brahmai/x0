But I am encountering an error that says - `ImportError: No module named dateutil.relativedelta`. I am importing using `from dateutil.relativedelta import *`. Furthermore, I can see the package when I search. Here are the paths I found - `/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/dateutil/relativedelta.pyc`, `/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/dateutil/relativedelta.py`, and `/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/dateutil/relativedelta.pyo`. Why is Python unable to find the `dateutil.relativedelta` module?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering likely stems from a mismatch between the Python version you're using and the installed version of the `dateutil` library. Here's a detailed breakdown of what might be happening and how you can resolve it:\n\n1. **Python Version Mismatch**: The paths you provided indicate that the `dateutil` library is installed for Python 2.7, but you are attempting to use Python 2.6.7. This mismatch can cause Python 2.6.7 to be unable to locate the `relativedelta` module because it is looking for packages in the Python 2.6 site-packages directory, not the Python 2.7 directory.\n\n2. **Solution Options**:\n   - **Install Dateutil for Python 2.6**: You need to ensure that `dateutil` is installed specifically for Python 2.6. You can do this by using a package manager like `pip` targeting the correct Python version:\n     ```bash\n     python2.6 -m pip install python-dateutil\n     ```\n     If `pip` is not available for Python 2.6, you might need to download the package manually and install it.\n\n   - **Use the Correct Python Version**: If possible, consider switching to Python 2.7 for your project, as it has broader support and more recent libraries available. Make sure all dependencies are compatible with Python 2.7.\n\n3. **Ensure Environment Consistency**:\n   - Verify that the Python environment you are using to run the program is the same one where the `dateutil` package is installed. You can check this by running:\n     ```bash\n     python2.6 -c \"import sys; print(sys.path)\"\n     ```\n     This will show you the paths Python 2.6 is using to search for modules.\n\n4. **Check for Multiple Python Installations**: If you have multiple Python installations, ensure that you are using the correct interpreter. Use the full path to the desired Python version if necessary (e.g., `/usr/bin/python2.6`).\n\nBy addressing the version mismatch and ensuring that `dateutil` is installed in the correct environment, you should be able to resolve the `ImportError`."
