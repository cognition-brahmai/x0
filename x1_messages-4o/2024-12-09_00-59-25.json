Specifically, I want to use the CMRmap colormap, but I want to exclude the \"black\" color at the start and the \"white\" color at the end. I am interested in plotting my data using only the in-between colors. I have searched online but haven't found a simple solution. Can anyone suggest a solution to this?"

        "content": "To extract a subset of a colormap in Matplotlib, you can use the `matplotlib.colors` module to create a new colormap that only includes the desired range of colors. Here's how you can do it for the `CMRmap` colormap, excluding the black color at the start and the white color at the end:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nfrom matplotlib.colors import LinearSegmentedColormap\n\n# Define a function to truncate the colormap\ndef truncate_colormap(cmap, min_val=0.0, max_val=1.0, n=100):\n    new_cmap = LinearSegmentedColormap.from_list(\n        'truncated({},{:.2f},{:.2f})'.format(cmap.name, min_val, max_val),\n        cmap(np.linspace(min_val, max_val, n)))\n    return new_cmap\n\n# Load the CMRmap colormap\noriginal_cmap = plt.get_cmap('CMRmap')\n\n# Truncate the colormap to exclude the first and last 5% of colors\ntruncated_cmap = truncate_colormap(original_cmap, 0.05, 0.95)\n\n# Example data to plot\ndata = np.random.rand(10, 10)\n\n# Plot using the truncated colormap\nplt.imshow(data, cmap=truncated_cmap)\nplt.colorbar()\nplt.title('Data with Truncated CMRmap Colormap')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this solution:\n\n1. We define a `truncate_colormap` function to create a new colormap from a subset of an existing colormap.\n2. The function uses `np.linspace` to sample the colormap between `min_val` and `max_val`. In this case, 0.05 and 0.95 are chosen to exclude the first and last 5% of the colors.\n3. We plot the data using the new truncated colormap.\n\nYou can adjust `min_val` and `max_val` to exclude more or less of the colormap as needed."
