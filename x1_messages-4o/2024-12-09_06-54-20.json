I'm confident that my code for unregularized linear regression is correct, as shown here:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_model(features, labels):\n    return np.linalg.pinv(features).dot(labels)\n```\n\nHowever, I'm not sure what's wrong with my regularized solution:\n\n```python\ndef get_model(features, labels, lamb=0.0):\n    n_cols = features.shape[1]\n    return linalg.inv(features.transpose().dot(features) + lamb * np.identity(n_cols))\\\n            .dot(features.transpose()).dot(labels)\n```\n\nMy intention is that when the default value of 0.0 is used for lamb, it should give the same result as the unregularized version. However, the difference in results is quite large. Can anyone identify the issue with my code?"

        "content": "The issue you're facing seems to stem from the difference between the two implementations of the linear regression solutions. Let\u2019s address the regularized linear regression with L2 regularization (also known as Ridge Regression) and see what might be going wrong.\n\nYour regularized linear regression implementation is attempting to solve the following equation:\n\n\\[ \\theta = (X^T X + \\lambda I)^{-1} X^T y \\]\n\nThis is indeed the correct formula for Ridge Regression. However, there are a few potential issues that might cause the difference in results between the regularized and unregularized versions:\n\n1. **Numerical Stability**: The `np.linalg.inv()` function can be numerically unstable, especially if the matrix \\( X^T X + \\lambda I \\) is close to singular. You might want to use `np.linalg.pinv()` instead, which is the pseudo-inverse and handles these issues more robustly.\n\n2. **Identity Matrix Scaling**: Ensure that the identity matrix you\u2019re adding is scaled correctly by the regularization parameter \\( \\lambda \\). This might seem trivial, but any mistake here can lead to incorrect results.\n\n3. **Feature Scaling**: If your features have not been scaled properly, the regularization effect can vary significantly between features, leading to unexpected results.\n\n4. **Check for Bugs in Data Preprocessing**: Ensure that your features and labels are being prepared consistently between the unregularized and regularized versions.\n\nHere\u2019s a revised version of your regularized function using `np.linalg.pinv()`:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_model(features, labels, lamb=0.0):\n    n_cols = features.shape[1]\n    # Use pseudo-inverse for better numerical stability\n    return np.linalg.pinv(features.T.dot(features) + lamb * np.eye(n_cols))\\\n            .dot(features.T).dot(labels)\n```\n\nCheck the following when you test this:\n\n- Ensure that your input data (features and labels) are the same between your tests.\n- Scale your features if necessary to ensure that all have similar ranges.\n- Test with `lamb=0.0` to see if it matches the unregularized version closely.\n\nIf the difference persists, it might be helpful to test with a simple dataset where you can easily compute the expected results manually to debug further."
