Specifically, I have a class that manages jobs for concurrently executing commands on remote machines over ssh. It currently generates debugging messages and has an interface for incrementally returning and storing results. However, I want to improve its flexibility by supporting multiple results/output streams. I am considering using the PyPubSub package, but I am also open to other suggestions. Here is how I currently use the class:\n\n```python\njob = SSHJobMan(hostlist, cmd)\njob.start()\nwhile not job.done():\n    for each in job.poll():\n        incrementally_process(job.results[each])\n        time.sleep(0.2) # or other more useful work\npost_process(job.results)\n```\n\nAnd an alternative usage model is:\n\n```python\njob = SSHJobMan(hostlist, cmd)\njob.wait()  # implicitly performs a start()\nprocess(job.results)\n```\n\nThe full code can be found at: http://bitbucket.org/jimd/classh."

        "content": "To enhance the flexibility of your `SSHJobMan` class using the Observer pattern, you can indeed use the PyPubSub package or implement a custom observer pattern. The Observer pattern allows you to decouple the source of data from its consumers by notifying registered observers whenever a change occurs. Here, I'll show you a basic implementation of the Observer pattern using both a custom approach and the PyPubSub package.\n\n### Custom Observer Pattern Implementation\n\n1. **Define the Observer Interface**: Create an interface for observers that defines a method to update them with new data.\n\n2. **Modify `SSHJobMan` Class to Support Observers**: Add methods to attach, detach, and notify observers.\n\n3. **Implement Concrete Observers**: Define concrete observer classes that implement the observer interface and define how they handle updates.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n```python\nclass Observer:\n    def update(self, result):\n        pass\n\nclass SSHJobObserver(Observer):\n    def update(self, result):\n        print(f\"Received result: {result}\")\n\nclass SSHJobMan:\n    def __init__(self, hostlist, cmd):\n        self.hostlist = hostlist\n        self.cmd = cmd\n        self.results = {}\n        self.observers = []\n\n    def attach(self, observer):\n        self.observers.append(observer)\n\n    def detach(self, observer):\n        self.observers.remove(observer)\n\n    def notify(self, result):\n        for observer in self.observers:\n            observer.update(result)\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Simulate executing commands and getting results\n        for host in self.hostlist:\n            result = f\"Result from {host}\"\n            self.results[host] = result\n            self.notify(result)\n\n    def done(self):\n        # Simulate checking if the job is done\n        return True\n\n    def poll(self):\n        return self.results.keys()\n\n# Usage\njob = SSHJobMan(['host1', 'host2'], 'some_command')\nobserver = SSHJobObserver()\njob.attach(observer)\njob.start()\n```\n\n### Using PyPubSub Package\n\nIf you prefer using the PyPubSub package, the setup is slightly different. First, install the package using:\n\n```bash\npip install PyPubSub\n```\n\nThen, implement the Observer pattern with PyPubSub:\n\n```python\nfrom pubsub import pub\n\nclass SSHJobMan:\n    def __init__(self, hostlist, cmd):\n        self.hostlist = hostlist\n        self.cmd = cmd\n        self.results = {}\n\n    def start(self):\n        # Simulate executing commands and getting results\n        for host in self.hostlist:\n            result = f\"Result from {host}\"\n            self.results[host] = result\n            pub.sendMessage('job.result', result=result)\n\n    def done(self):\n        return True\n\n    def poll(self):\n        return self.results.keys()\n\ndef listener(result):\n    print(f\"Listener received: {result}\")\n\n# Subscribe the listener to the 'job.result' topic\npub.subscribe(listener, 'job.result')\n\n# Usage\njob = SSHJobMan(['host1', 'host2'], 'some_command')\njob.start()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Custom Implementation**: You define your own observer interface and manage subscriptions manually. This gives you complete control over the implementation.\n- **PyPubSub Implementation**: This library simplifies the observer pattern by providing a robust publish-subscribe mechanism. You can define topics and let the library handle the registration and notification of observers.\n\nChoose the approach that best fits your application's architecture and requirements. PyPubSub is great for larger applications where decoupling is essential, while a custom implementation might suffice for simpler use cases."
