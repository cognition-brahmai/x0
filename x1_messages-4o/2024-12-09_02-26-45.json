Also, why does it take 12 more bytes for 2\u2076\u00b3 compared to 2\u2076\u00b3 - 1 and not just one? Lastly, why are int() and long() 24 bytes, but long(1) is already 28 bytes and int(2\u2076\u00b2)?"

        "content": "In Python, especially Python 3, all integers are of the type `int`, which is of arbitrary precision. This means that Python can handle very large integers because it allocates more memory as needed for larger numbers.\n\n### Memory Storage of Integers:\n\n1. **Memory Allocation:**\n   - The memory allocation for integers in Python involves some overhead. For each integer, Python allocates memory for the object header and the actual data.\n   - The object header contains metadata about the object such as reference count and type information.\n\n2. **Difference in Sizes:**\n   - When you calculate `2**63`, it becomes a larger number that requires more bits to represent than `2**63 - 1`. Python's integer representation dynamically allocates enough space to store the integer, including the overhead and the actual number of bytes needed.\n   - `2**63` crosses a boundary where the representation requires more space (due to how numbers are stored in binary and the overhead of the Python object model), thus it takes more memory.\n\n3. **Why 36 vs. 24 Bytes:**\n   - The size you're seeing (36 bytes for `2**63` and 24 bytes for `2**63 - 1`) includes the overhead of Python\u2019s integer object and the actual data.\n   - When the number of bits required to represent a number increases past a certain threshold, additional memory is allocated to store the additional data, which may involve more than just one additional byte due to how memory is allocated in chunks.\n\n### `int()` and `long()` Sizes:\n\n- In Python 3, `int` is of arbitrary precision and there is no `long` type as there was in Python 2. All integers are of type `int`.\n- The size of an `int` object is more than just the size of the number itself; it includes the object overhead.\n  \n- **`int()` and `long()` Sizes:**\n  - The basic size of an `int` object includes the memory for the object\u2019s structure.\n  - An empty `int()` or `long()` is primarily the overhead without any additional data, hence it might show as 24 bytes.\n\n- **`long(1)` being 28 bytes:**\n  - This is due to the additional memory needed to store the actual integer value `1` as opposed to just the structure.\n  - The increase from 24 to 28 bytes is indicative of the space required to store additional data beyond the base overhead.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Python's integer representation is optimized for handling a wide range of integer values, and it uses memory dynamically to ensure that it can handle very large numbers without overflow.\n- The memory size of an integer in Python includes both a fixed overhead and a variable portion that grows with the size of the integer value itself. This can lead to seemingly non-linear increases in memory usage as integers grow in size."
