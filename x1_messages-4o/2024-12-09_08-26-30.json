I originally set it up using this command: \n\n```virtualenv --no-site-packages -p python2.5 myenv```\n\nIn an attempt to upgrade, I ran virtualenv in the same directory using this command: \n\n```virtualenv --no-site-packages -p python2.6 myenv```\n\nHowever, the system is not overwriting the existing python script, and the default Python is still 2.5, even though I can specify 2.6. Is there a way to remove Python 2.5 entirely and have 'bin/python' point to Python 2.6 instead?"

        "content": "To upgrade your virtual environment from Python 2.5 to Python 2.6, you'll need to recreate the virtual environment. Unfortunately, virtualenv does not support in-place upgrades of the Python version. Here are the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. **Deactivate and Remove the Existing Virtual Environment**:\n   - First, deactivate your current virtual environment if it's active:\n     ```bash\n     deactivate\n     ```\n   - Remove the existing virtual environment directory. This will delete the entire environment, including installed packages:\n     ```bash\n     rm -rf myenv\n     ```\n\n2. **Create a New Virtual Environment with Python 2.6**:\n   - Create a new virtual environment using Python 2.6:\n     ```bash\n     virtualenv --no-site-packages -p python2.6 myenv\n     ```\n\n3. **Activate the New Virtual Environment**:\n   - Activate the newly created virtual environment:\n     ```bash\n     source myenv/bin/activate\n     ```\n\n4. **Reinstall Necessary Packages**:\n   - With the new virtual environment activated, reinstall any packages you need. If you have a `requirements.txt` file, you can use it to reinstall packages:\n     ```bash\n     pip install -r requirements.txt\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, you'll have a clean virtual environment set up with Python 2.6, and `bin/python` will point to Python 2.6. Remember to always back up any important data or configurations before removing directories."
