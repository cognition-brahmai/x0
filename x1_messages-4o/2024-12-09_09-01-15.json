        "content": "To create a Node.js web server that can receive a POST request and identify the key-value pairs within the body, you can use the `express` framework, which simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests, including parsing request bodies. Here's a step-by-step guide to setting up such a server:\n\n1. **Initialize your project**: If you haven't already, create a new directory for your project and initialize a Node.js project.\n\n    ```bash\n    mkdir my-node-server\n    cd my-node-server\n    npm init -y\n    ```\n\n2. **Install Express**: Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.\n\n    ```bash\n    npm install express\n    ```\n\n3. **Set up the server**: Create a file named `server.js` (or any name you prefer) and write the following code to set up an Express server that can handle POST requests and parse JSON bodies.\n\n    ```javascript\n    const express = require('express');\n    const app = express();\n    const port = 3000;\n\n    // Middleware to parse JSON bodies\n    app.use(express.json());\n\n    // Define a POST route\n    app.post('/receive-data', (req, res) => {\n        // Access the JSON body\n        const body = req.body;\n        console.log('Received data:', body);\n\n        // Respond back with the received data\n        res.json({\n            message: 'Data received successfully',\n            receivedData: body\n        });\n    });\n\n    // Start the server\n    app.listen(port, () => {\n        console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);\n    });\n    ```\n\n4. **Run the server**: Use Node.js to run your server.\n\n    ```bash\n    node server.js\n    ```\n\n5. **Test the server**: You can use a tool like Postman or `curl` to send a POST request to your server with a JSON body.\n\n   Using `curl`, you can test it by running:\n\n    ```bash\n    curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/receive-data -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"key1\":\"value1\", \"key2\":\"value2\"}'\n    ```\n\n   You should see the server log the received data and return a response with the same data.\n\nBy following these steps, you'll have a basic Node.js server set up that can receive and process POST requests with JSON payloads. You can extend this server with additional routes, error handling, and other middleware as needed for your application."
