        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the presence of the `.ipynb_checkpoints` directory within your dataset folder. This directory is automatically created by Jupyter Notebooks to store checkpoint files, and it does not contain any valid image files for training.\n\nHere are a few steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Remove or Ignore `.ipynb_checkpoints`:** \n   - You can manually delete the `.ipynb_checkpoints` folder from your dataset directory if it's not needed.\n   - Alternatively, you can filter out the `.ipynb_checkpoints` directory when creating the dataset. This can be done by modifying the `ImageFolder` class to ignore this directory.\n\n2. **Modify Dataset Creation:**\n   - You can subclass `torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder` to override the directory scanning logic and exclude `.ipynb_checkpoints`.\n\nHere's an example of how you might modify the behavior:\n\n```python\nfrom torchvision.datasets import ImageFolder\nimport os\n\nclass CustomImageFolder(ImageFolder):\n    def find_classes(self, directory):\n        classes = [d.name for d in os.scandir(directory) if d.is_dir() and d.name != '.ipynb_checkpoints']\n        classes.sort()\n        class_to_idx = {cls_name: i for i, cls_name in enumerate(classes)}\n        return classes, class_to_idx\n\ntransform = transforms.Compose([transforms.Resize(400), transforms.ToTensor()])\ndataset_path = 'ss/'\ndataset = CustomImageFolder(root=dataset_path, transform=transform)\ndataloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=20)\n```\n\n3. **Reorganize Your Dataset:**\n   - Ensure that your dataset is organized such that the root folder contains subfolders, where each subfolder corresponds to a class and contains images for that class. The `.ipynb_checkpoints` should not be at the same level as your class directories.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to avoid the `FileNotFoundError` and successfully load your dataset."
