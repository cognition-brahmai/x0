Can you give me an example using the following sentence:\n\"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\nHere's an example Go code:\npackage main\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"strings\"\n)\nfunc main() {\n\tsentence := \"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\n\twords := strings.Split(sentence, \" \")\n\tfor i := len(words) - 1; i >= 0; i-- {\n\t\tfmt.Printf(\"%s \", words[i])\n\t}\n} \nThis code splits the sentence into individual words using the Split() function from the strings package, and then iterates over the words in reverse order to print them out in the desired rearranged order."

Here's the code you provided with additional comments for clarity:\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"strings\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// Define the sentence to be rearranged\n\tsentence := \"the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"\n\t\n\t// Split the sentence into words\n\twords := strings.Split(sentence, \" \")\n\n\t// Iterate over the words in reverse order and print them\n\tfor i := len(words) - 1; i >= 0; i-- {\n\t\tfmt.Printf(\"%s \", words[i])\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output:\n\n```\ndog lazy the over jumps fox brown quick the \n```\n\nThis output is the reverse order of the words in the original sentence. If you want to rearrange the words in a different order, you can modify the logic within the loop or use a sorting algorithm or any custom logic to achieve the desired arrangement."
