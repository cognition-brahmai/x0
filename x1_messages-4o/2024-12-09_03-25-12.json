        "content": "Setting up GeoDjango on Windows can sometimes be challenging due to its dependency on the GDAL library. The errors \"Could not find the GDAL library\" or \"OSError: [WinError 126]\" often indicate that the GDAL binaries are not properly installed or not in the system path. Here's a step-by-step guide to resolving these issues:\n\n1. **Download and Install GDAL:**\n   - Visit the [GISInternals website](https://www.gisinternals.com/release.php) and download the GDAL core and GDAL Python bindings that match your Python version and system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).\n   - Make sure to choose the GDAL version that is compatible with your version of Python and Django.\n\n2. **Install GDAL Core:**\n   - Extract the downloaded GDAL core package to a directory of your choice, e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\GDAL`.\n\n3. **Set Environment Variables:**\n   - Add the path to the GDAL binaries to your system's PATH environment variable. For example, if you extracted GDAL to `C:\\Program Files\\GDAL`, you would add `C:\\Program Files\\GDAL\\bin` to your PATH.\n   - Set the `GDAL_DATA` environment variable to point to the `data` folder within your GDAL installation, e.g., `C:\\Program Files\\GDAL\\gdal-data`.\n\n4. **Install GDAL Python Bindings:**\n   - Open a command prompt and use `pip` to install the GDAL Python bindings. You may need to specify the version that matches your GDAL installation, e.g.:\n     ```bash\n     pip install gdal==3.4.0\n     ```\n   - Make sure the version you install matches the version of the GDAL binaries.\n\n5. **Verify Installation:**\n   - To verify that GDAL is installed correctly, open a Python shell and try importing GDAL:\n     ```python\n     from osgeo import gdal\n     print(gdal.VersionInfo())\n     ```\n   - If no errors are raised, GDAL is set up correctly.\n\n6. **Configure Django Settings:**\n   - In your Django settings file, ensure that you have specified the path to the GDAL library correctly:\n     ```python\n     GDAL_LIBRARY_PATH = r'C:\\Program Files\\GDAL\\bin\\gdal300.dll'\n     ```\n   - Adjust the path to match the actual location and version of the GDAL DLL on your system.\n\n7. **Restart Your System:**\n   - Sometimes, changes to the PATH environment variable require a system restart to take effect.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the errors related to the GDAL library when setting up GeoDjango on Windows. If you encounter further issues, make sure to double-check the compatibility between your Python version, Django version, and GDAL binaries."
