I am not sure how to create a new dataframe after identifying the best features. I have the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_classif\nselect_k_best_classifier = SelectKBest(score_func=f_classif, k=5).fit_transform(features_dataframe, targeted_class)\ndataframe = pd.DataFrame(select_k_best_classifier)\n```\nAfter running this, I receive a new dataframe without feature names, only indices ranging from 0 to 4. I believe I should replace the dataframe line with the following:\n\n```python\ndataframe = pd.DataFrame(fit_transofrmed_features, columns=features_names)\n```\nBut I am unsure of how to create the 'features_names' list. I understand that I should use the 'get_support()' function of the 'select_k_best_classifier', which returns an array of boolean values. The 'True' value in this array represents the index in the right column. How do I incorporate this boolean array with the array of all feature names that I can obtain via the method:\n\n```python\nfeature_names = list(features_dataframe.columns.values)\n```"

        "content": "To create a new DataFrame with the selected K-best features while retaining the feature names, you can indeed use the `get_support()` method, which helps identify the selected features. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:\n\n1. Use `get_support()` to get a boolean array indicating which features were selected.\n2. Use this boolean array to index the original feature names.\n\nHere's how your code can be modified:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_classif\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming 'features_dataframe' is your original DataFrame and 'targeted_class' is your target variable\nselect_k_best_classifier = SelectKBest(score_func=f_classif, k=5)\nfit_transformed_features = select_k_best_classifier.fit_transform(features_dataframe, targeted_class)\n\n# Get the boolean array indicating which features are selected\nsupport = select_k_best_classifier.get_support()\n\n# Get the original feature names\nfeature_names = list(features_dataframe.columns.values)\n\n# Index the feature_names with the support array to get the names of selected features\nselected_feature_names = [feature_names[i] for i in range(len(feature_names)) if support[i]]\n\n# Create a new DataFrame with the selected features and their names\ndataframe = pd.DataFrame(fit_transformed_features, columns=selected_feature_names)\n\n# Now 'dataframe' contains your selected features with their original names\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `support` is a boolean array where `True` indicates the feature was selected.\n- `selected_feature_names` uses list comprehension to create a list of feature names that correspond to the selected features.\n- Finally, when creating the new DataFrame, you pass `fit_transformed_features` and `selected_feature_names` to ensure the new DataFrame has both the selected data and the correct column names."
