        "content": "Here's a simple example of a birthday greeting in HTML format, complete with CSS to make it more visually appealing. You can customize the name and image URL as needed:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Happy Birthday!</title>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;\n            background-color: #f0f8ff;\n            color: #333;\n            text-align: center;\n            padding: 20px;\n        }\n        .card {\n            background-color: #ffebcd;\n            border-radius: 15px;\n            box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);\n            display: inline-block;\n            padding: 20px;\n            max-width: 500px;\n            margin-top: 50px;\n        }\n        .cake-image {\n            width: 80%;\n            max-width: 300px;\n            border-radius: 10px;\n        }\n        .message {\n            font-size: 1.2em;\n            margin-top: 15px;\n        }\n        .name {\n            color: #ff4500;\n            font-weight: bold;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div class=\"card\">\n        <img src=\"https://via.placeholder.com/300x200?text=Birthday+Cake\" alt=\"Birthday Cake\" class=\"cake-image\">\n        <div class=\"message\">\n            \ud83c\udf89 Happy 12th Birthday, <span class=\"name\">Alex!</span> \ud83c\udf88<br>\n            We hope your day is filled with fun, laughter, and lots of cake!\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **HTML Structure**: The HTML contains a `div` with a class of `card` which holds the image and the birthday message. The name of the birthday person is highlighted using a span with the class `name`.\n- **CSS Styling**:\n  - The `body` has a light background color and a centered text alignment to make it visually appealing and easy to read.\n  - The `.card` class styles the greeting card with a soft background color, rounded corners, and a subtle shadow for a 3D effect.\n  - The `.cake-image` class ensures the image is responsive and fits well within the card.\n  - The `.message` class increases the font size for readability and adds a margin for spacing.\n  - The `.name` class changes the text color to orange and makes it bold to emphasize the birthday person's name.\n\nFeel free to replace the placeholder image URL with a real image of a birthday cake and the name \"Alex\" with the actual name of the birthday person."
