For example, if my list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], I want to transform it into [2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5, 8, 7, 10, 9]. The size of the lists may vary, but they will always contain an even number of elements. Currently, I am doing it in the following way:\n\n<pre><code>\nl =  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nfinal_l = []\nfor i in range(0, len(l)/2):\n    final_l.append(l[2*i+1])\n    final_l.append(l[2*i])\n</code></pre>\n\nI am new to Python and I understand that the above method isn't really Pythonic. Is there a better, more efficient way to achieve this, perhaps using list comprehension?"

        "content": "Yes, you can achieve the swapping of elements in a more Pythonic way using list comprehension. You can iterate over the indices with a step of 2 and swap the elements directly while creating the new list. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nl = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nfinal_l = [l[i+1] if i % 2 == 0 else l[i-1] for i in range(len(l))]\n```\n\nIn this list comprehension, we check if the index `i` is even. If it is, we take the element at the next index `i+1`; otherwise, we take the element at the previous index `i-1`. This effectively swaps each pair of elements in the list.\n\nAlternatively, you can also do:\n\n```python\nl = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\nfinal_l = [l[i+1] for i in range(0, len(l), 2)] + [l[i] for i in range(0, len(l), 2)]\n```\n\nThis approach creates two separate lists: one with the elements in odd positions and the other with elements in even positions, and then concatenates them. Both methods are concise and make use of Python's powerful list comprehension feature."
