I understand how sentence-level BLEU score works, but I don't understand how corpus-level BLEU score work. In my code, the sentence-level BLEU score is as expected, taking into account the brevity-penalty and the missing word \"a\". However, for some reason, the corpus-level BLEU score is 0, while I was expecting it to be at least 0.5. Could you help me understand why this is the case? \n\nHere is my code for corpus-level BLEU score:\n\n```python\nimport nltk\n\nhypothesis = ['This', 'is', 'cat'] \nreference = ['This', 'is', 'a', 'cat']\nBLEUscore = nltk.translate.bleu_score.corpus_bleu([reference], [hypothesis], weights = [1])\nprint(BLEUscore)\n```\n\nAnd here is my code for sentence-level BLEU score:\n\n```python\nimport nltk\n\nhypothesis = ['This', 'is', 'cat'] \nreference = ['This', 'is', 'a', 'cat']\nBLEUscore = nltk.translate.bleu_score.sentence_bleu([reference], hypothesis, weights = [1])\nprint(BLEUscore)\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're facing with the corpus-level BLEU score calculation stems from the way the `corpus_bleu` function in NLTK handles the input data and computes the score. Let's go through the differences and identify why you're getting a score of 0 for the corpus-level BLEU.\n\n### Understanding the BLEU Score Calculation\n\n1. **Sentence-level BLEU**:\n   - The `sentence_bleu` function calculates the BLEU score for a single sentence pair (hypothesis and reference).\n   - It considers the precision of n-grams and applies the brevity penalty based on the length of the hypothesis relative to the reference.\n   - Since you're using `weights = [1]`, it computes unigram precision, which means it checks how many unigrams in the hypothesis appear in the reference.\n\n2. **Corpus-level BLEU**:\n   - The `corpus_bleu` function is intended to calculate the BLEU score across multiple sentence pairs (a corpus).\n   - It takes a list of reference sentences and a list of hypotheses. Each element in these lists should itself be a list of sentences.\n   - The function aggregates the counts of n-grams across the entire corpus and applies the brevity penalty based on the total length of all hypotheses and references.\n\n### Why You're Getting a Score of 0\n\nIn your code, the `corpus_bleu` function is being called with one reference list and one hypothesis list. However, in the context of `corpus_bleu`, each of these lists is expected to be a list of sentences. Here's how you should structure your input:\n\n- The `reference` should be a list of lists where each sublist contains reference sentences for a particular hypothesis.\n- The `hypothesis` should be a list of lists where each sublist contains the hypothesis sentence.\n\nHere is how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport nltk\n\n# Wrap both reference and hypothesis in an additional list to indicate a corpus with one sentence pair.\nhypothesis = [['This', 'is', 'cat']] \nreference = [['This', 'is', 'a', 'cat']]\n\n# Now call corpus_bleu with the correct structure\nBLEUscore = nltk.translate.bleu_score.corpus_bleu([reference], hypothesis, weights=[1])\nprint(BLEUscore)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Correct Input Structure\n\n- By wrapping `reference` and `hypothesis` in an additional list, you specify that there is one pair of sentences in the corpus.\n- `corpus_bleu` will now correctly interpret the data as a single hypothesis-reference pair and calculate the BLEU score accordingly.\n\nThis adjustment should yield a corpus-level BLEU score that aligns more closely with your expectations."
