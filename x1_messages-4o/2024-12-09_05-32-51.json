In Python 3, I can use the syntax:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    raise OneException('sorry')\nexcept OneException as e:\n    # after a failed attempt of mitigation:\n    raise AnotherException('I give up') from e\n```\nwhich allows raising a follow-up exception without losing context. However, in Python 2, the closest analogy I could come up with is:\n\n```python\nraise AnotherException((e,'I give up')), None, sys.exc_info()[2]\n```\nwhere the `(e,'')` is a workaround to include the original exception's name in the message. Is there a better way to achieve this?"

        "content": "In Python 2, you can't directly use the `raise ... from` syntax that Python 3 provides, which allows chaining exceptions explicitly. However, you can achieve similar behavior by manually handling the traceback to maintain the context of the original exception. Here's a more refined way to do it, using the `traceback` module to keep the original traceback intact:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport traceback\n\nclass OneException(Exception):\n    pass\n\nclass AnotherException(Exception):\n    pass\n\ntry:\n    try:\n        raise OneException('sorry')\n    except OneException as e:\n        # Capture the current exception info\n        exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback = sys.exc_info()\n        # Try to handle the exception or decide to re-raise a different one\n        raise AnotherException('I give up'), None, exc_traceback\nexcept AnotherException as ae:\n    # Optionally, print the traceback\n    traceback.print_exc()\n    # Handle AnotherException here\n```\n\nThis code uses `sys.exc_info()` to get the type, value, and traceback of the active exception, and then raises a new exception while preserving the traceback of the original one. This way, you maintain the original context as much as possible in Python 2.\n\nNote that Python 2 reached its end of life in January 2020, and it's recommended to use Python 3 for new projects when possible."
