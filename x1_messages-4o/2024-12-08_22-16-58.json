        "content": "The parallax angle is a measure of the apparent shift in position of a nearby star against the backdrop of distant stars as observed from two different positions in Earth's orbit around the Sun. The formula for calculating the distance to a star using parallax is:\n\n\\[ d = \\frac{1}{p} \\]\n\nwhere \\( d \\) is the distance to the star in parsecs, and \\( p \\) is the parallax angle in arcseconds.\n\n### How Parallax is Used to Measure Distance\n\n- **Principle:** As Earth orbits the Sun, nearby stars appear to move against the distant background stars due to the change in the observer's point of view.\n- **Measurement:** By measuring the parallax angle, which is half the angle that the star seems to move over six months, astronomers can calculate the distance to the star.\n\n### Limitations of Parallax\n\nParallax is most effective for stars within a few hundred light-years from Earth. Beyond this range, the parallax angle becomes too small to measure accurately with current technology. As a result, the parallax method is not useful for determining distances to the furthest stars.\n\n### Luminosity Distance\n\nFor distances beyond the reach of parallax, astronomers use the concept of \"luminosity distance,\" especially in cosmology. The formula for luminosity distance \\( D_L \\) is:\n\n\\[ D_L = \\sqrt{\\frac{L}{4\\pi F}} \\]\n\nwhere \\( L \\) is the absolute luminosity of the astronomical object and \\( F \\) is the observed flux.\n\n### How Luminosity Distance is Used\n\n- **Standard Candles:** It relies on objects of known luminosity, such as Cepheid variables or Type Ia supernovae, to determine distances.\n- **Redshift:** In cosmology, it often incorporates redshift measurements to account for the expansion of the universe.\n\n### Approximate Distance of the Furthest Known Star\n\nThe parallax method currently can measure distances up to a few thousand light-years with missions like Gaia. However, for stars in other galaxies, astronomers rely on luminosity distance and redshift. The furthest known individual star detected is Earendel, at about 28 billion light-years away, observed through gravitational lensing and not through parallax. This star is significantly beyond the reach of both parallax and direct luminosity distance measurements, showcasing the complexity of measuring vast cosmic distances."
