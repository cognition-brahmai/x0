        "content": "To count the number of NaN values in each column of a pandas DataFrame, you can use the `isna()` method in combination with the `sum()` method. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming 'df' is your DataFrame\nnan_counts = df.isna().sum()\n\nprint(nan_counts)\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of what each part does:\n\n- `df.isna()`: This returns a DataFrame of the same shape as `df`, where each cell contains a Boolean value: `True` if the original cell was NaN, and `False` otherwise.\n- `.sum()`: When applied to a DataFrame, `.sum()` calculates the sum of each column by default. Since `True` is treated as `1` and `False` as `0`, this effectively counts the number of `True` values (i.e., NaNs) in each column.\n\nThis will give you a Series with the column names as the index and the number of NaN values in each column as the corresponding values."
