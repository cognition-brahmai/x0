For example, in the following list:\n\n```python\nlist = [{'id':'1234','name':'Jason'},\n        {'id':'name':'Tom'},\n        {'id':'3456','name':'Art'}]\n```\nI want to find the index position by matching on `name = 'Tom'`. If this were a one-dimensional list, I could use `list.index()`. However, I'm unsure how to proceed by searching the values of the dictionaries within the list."

        "content": "To find the index position of a dictionary within a list of dictionaries by matching a specific dictionary value, you can use a loop to iterate over the list and check each dictionary for the desired key-value pair. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Your list of dictionaries\ndict_list = [\n    {'id': '1234', 'name': 'Jason'},\n    {'id': '2345', 'name': 'Tom'},\n    {'id': '3456', 'name': 'Art'}\n]\n\n# The target name you are looking for\ntarget_name = 'Tom'\n\n# Function to find the index\ndef find_index_by_name(dict_list, target_name):\n    for index, dictionary in enumerate(dict_list):\n        if dictionary.get('name') == target_name:\n            return index\n    return -1  # Return -1 if not found\n\n# Get the index\nindex_position = find_index_by_name(dict_list, target_name)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"The index position of the dictionary with name '{target_name}' is: {index_position}\")\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- We define a function `find_index_by_name` that takes the list of dictionaries and the target name as arguments.\n- We use `enumerate` to loop over the list, which gives us both the index and the dictionary at each iteration.\n- We use `dictionary.get('name')` to safely access the 'name' field of each dictionary and compare it with the target name.\n- If a match is found, the function returns the current index.\n- If no match is found after checking all dictionaries, the function returns -1 to indicate that the target name was not found. \n\nNote: Make sure your list is named something other than `list` to avoid shadowing the built-in Python `list` type."
