        "content": "I am working with BigQuery and need to create a new variable from my dataset. The new variable should count a variable (x) if a certain condition in variable (y) is met. I am unable to use WHERE or HAVING as the condition is only related to the calculation of this specific variable. Here is a rough example of the code I have been trying:\n\n```sql\nCOUNT(DISTINCT sessionid IF(date > \u201c2018-06-01\u201d && date < \u201c2018-06-30\u201d)) \nAS sessions_lastmonth\n```\nMy goal is to find the number of sessions that occurred in a specific period. I can't simply count the dates as one day can contain multiple sessions and not every row represents a different session. How can I correctly implement this?"

        "content": "To achieve the desired result in BigQuery, you can use the `COUNTIF` function along with a `CASE` statement or simply leverage the `FILTER` clause within the `COUNT` aggregate function to apply a condition to the count. However, as you are dealing with distinct session IDs, you should use the `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` pattern within a `CASE` statement or `FILTER` clause to apply your condition. Here\u2019s how you can structure your query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE \n                    WHEN date > '2018-06-01' AND date < '2018-06-30' THEN sessionid \n                    ELSE NULL \n                 END) AS sessions_lastmonth\nFROM \n  your_table_name;\n```\n\nAlternatively, if your BigQuery version supports it, you can also use a `FILTER` clause to achieve the same result:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n  COUNT(DISTINCT sessionid) FILTER(\n    WHERE date > '2018-06-01' AND date < '2018-06-30'\n  ) AS sessions_lastmonth\nFROM \n  your_table_name;\n```\n\nIn both cases, replace `your_table_name` with the actual name of your table. These queries will count distinct `sessionid` values only for rows where the date falls within the specified range."
