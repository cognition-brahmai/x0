The keys of the dictionary should be the indices of the list elements, and the values should be the elements themselves. For instance, given the list `a = [51,27,13,56]`, I want to create a dictionary that looks like this: `{0:51, 1:27, 2:13, 3:56}`."

Here's how you can achieve that in a single line of code:\n\n```python\na = [51, 27, 13, 56]\nresult = {i: value for i, value in enumerate(a)}\n```\n\nThis code uses the `enumerate()` function, which provides both the index and the value of each element in the list. The dictionary comprehension then constructs a dictionary where the keys are the indices and the values are the elements from the list. The resulting dictionary `result` will be `{0: 51, 1: 27, 2: 13, 3: 56}`."
