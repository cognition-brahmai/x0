I have the following code:\n\n```python\ndef totalFruit(self, tree: List[int]) -> int:\n    pass\n```\nWhen I run it, I get the following error: `NameError: name 'List' is not defined`. I tried importing `List` first but then I get an error saying `No module named 'List'`. Why isn't this working?"

To use `List`, you need to import it from the `typing` module.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code to fix the issue:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef totalFruit(self, tree: List[int]) -> int:\n    pass\n```\n\nBy adding `from typing import List`, you are importing the `List` type from the `typing` module, which allows you to use it for type hinting in your function definition. This should resolve the `NameError` you're experiencing."
