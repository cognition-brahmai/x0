I am aware of the PEP for Py3K for an OrderedDict, however, I am currently using Python 2.6.x. So, I am looking for recommendations for ordered dict implementations. Additionally, I have a compare function defined as below:\n\n```python\ndef mycmp(x1, y1, ln):\n  a = abs(x1-ln)\n  b = abs(y1-ln)\n  if a<b:\n    return -1\n  elif a>b:\n    return 1\n  else:\n    return 0\n```\n\nI am unsure about how to integrate this function into the ordering given in the ordered dict. I tried the following code:\n\n```python\nOrderedDict(sorted(d.items(), cmp=mycmp(len)))\n```\n\nBut I would like some suggestions on how to proceed."

        "content": "To achieve similar functionality to Java's `TreeSet` in Python, you can use the `sortedcontainers` module, which provides a `SortedSet`. This will maintain elements in a sorted order based on a comparator or key function.\n\nHowever, since you're using Python 2.6.x, which is quite outdated, you may need to implement some functionality manually or use third-party packages that are compatible with that version.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide to achieve what you need:\n\n1. **Install `sortedcontainers`:** First, you'll need to install the `sortedcontainers` package. You can do this using pip:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install sortedcontainers\n   ```\n\n   However, note that `sortedcontainers` may not support Python 2.6. If that's the case, you may need to upgrade to at least Python 2.7 or find an alternative package.\n\n2. **Use `SortedSet` with a key function:**\n\n   In the absence of a direct comparator in `sortedcontainers`, you can define a key function that utilizes your comparison logic. However, for Python 2.6, let's implement a basic version using a list and custom sorting.\n\n3. **Implementing a custom sorted set:**\n\n   Since `sortedcontainers` might not be compatible, here's a basic idea of how you could manually manage a sorted list with your comparator:\n\n   ```python\n   class CustomSortedSet:\n       def __init__(self, cmp_func):\n           self.elements = []\n           self.cmp_func = cmp_func\n\n       def add(self, element, ln):\n           self.elements.append(element)\n           self.elements.sort(cmp=lambda x, y: self.cmp_func(x, y, ln))\n\n       def __iter__(self):\n           return iter(self.elements)\n\n   def mycmp(x1, y1, ln):\n       a = abs(x1 - ln)\n       b = abs(y1 - ln)\n       if a < b:\n           return -1\n       elif a > b:\n           return 1\n       else:\n           return 0\n\n   # Usage\n   my_set = CustomSortedSet(mycmp)\n   ln_value = 5  # Example reference value for comparison\n   my_set.add(3, ln_value)\n   my_set.add(7, ln_value)\n   my_set.add(2, ln_value)\n\n   for item in my_set:\n       print(item)\n   ```\n\n   In this example, `CustomSortedSet` maintains a list of elements and sorts them using the `cmp_func` whenever a new element is added. Note that this is a simple implementation and may not have the performance characteristics of a balanced tree.\n\n4. **Consider updating to Python 2.7 or later:** Since Python 2.6 is very old and lacks many modern features, consider at least upgrading to Python 2.7, which is the last release in the 2.x series, or better yet, to a more recent version of Python 3.x, which offers significant improvements and libraries.\n\nThis approach should give you the ability to maintain an ordered collection based on your custom comparison function, similar to Java's `TreeSet`."
