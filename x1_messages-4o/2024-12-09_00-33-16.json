When I try to check the version using `pip3 --version` or `pip --version`, I see a `SyntaxError: invalid syntax` error. Similarly, when I try to install requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`, the same error occurs. I have attempted to resolve this by removing and reinstalling python, pip, python3, and pip3 multiple times, but the problem persists. How can I fix this issue?"

        "content": "The `SyntaxError: invalid syntax` error you are encountering when running `pip` or `pip3` commands is unusual and suggests there might be a deeper issue with your Python setup or environment. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Python Installation:**\n   - Ensure that Python 3.5 is correctly installed. You can verify this by running `python3 --version` or `python --version` to check the Python version.\n\n2. **Python and Pip Compatibility:**\n   - Make sure that the version of `pip` you are using is compatible with Python 3.5. Sometimes, newer versions of `pip` may not be compatible with older Python versions.\n\n3. **Reinstall Pip:**\n   - You can try reinstalling `pip` using `get-pip.py`. Download `get-pip.py` from the official [pip website](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) and run it with Python 3.5:\n     ```bash\n     python3 get-pip.py\n     ```\n\n4. **Check for Aliases or Path Issues:**\n   - Make sure there are no aliases or path issues causing the wrong `pip` or `pip3` to be invoked. Check your shell configuration files (like `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`) for any such aliases.\n\n5. **Virtual Environment:**\n   - Consider using a virtual environment to isolate your Python and pip setup. Create a virtual environment with:\n     ```bash\n     python3 -m venv myenv\n     source myenv/bin/activate\n     ```\n   - Once activated, ensure you are using the virtual environment's `pip`:\n     ```bash\n     pip --version\n     ```\n\n6. **Check Python Scripts:**\n   - Ensure that there are no Python scripts named `pip` or `pip3` in your current directory or in your `PATH` that might be conflicting with the actual pip executable.\n\n7. **Inspect the Error:**\n   - Carefully inspect the full error message for any clues. Sometimes, it might point to a specific line or file that is causing the issue.\n\n8. **Use Python Package Manager:**\n   - As a temporary workaround, you can directly use Python's package manager to install pip packages:\n     ```bash\n     python -m pip install -r requirements.txt\n     ```\n\n9. **System Package Manager:**\n   - Consider using your system's package manager to install Python and pip if you are on Linux. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use `apt`:\n     ```bash\n     sudo apt update\n     sudo apt install python3-pip\n     ```\n\nIf none of the above steps resolve your issue, please provide more context or error messages, and I'll be happy to help further."
