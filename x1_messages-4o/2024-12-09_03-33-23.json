I have a class setup as follows:\n\n```python\nimport cProfile\n\nclass Test():\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    def method(self):\n        cProfile.runctx(\"self.method_actual()\", globals(), locals())\n\n    def method_actual(self):\n        print \"Run\"\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    Test().method()\n```\n\nHowever, I encounter problems when I want \"method\" to return a value that is computed by \"method_actual\". I would like to avoid calling \"method_actual\" twice. Is there a thread-safe alternative? In my application, the cProfile data are saved to data files named by one of the args, so they don't get clobbered and I can combine them later."

        "content": "To achieve profiling with `cProfile` on an instance method and also return a computed value from that method, you can make use of the `cProfile.Profile` class directly. This approach allows you to have more control over the profiling process and enables you to return values from the profiled method without calling it multiple times.\n\nHere's how you can modify your `Test` class to achieve this:\n\n```python\nimport cProfile\nimport pstats\nimport io\n\nclass Test:\n\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    def method(self):\n        # Create a Profile object\n        profiler = cProfile.Profile()\n        \n        # Start profiling\n        profiler.enable()\n        \n        # Call the method and capture its return value\n        result = self.method_actual()\n        \n        # Stop profiling\n        profiler.disable()\n        \n        # Create a StringIO to store the profile stats\n        s = io.StringIO()\n        ps = pstats.Stats(profiler, stream=s).sort_stats('cumulative')\n        \n        # Print the profiling results\n        ps.print_stats()\n        print(s.getvalue())\n\n        # Return the result from method_actual\n        return result\n\n    def method_actual(self):\n        # Example computation\n        value = \"Run\"\n        print(value)\n        return value\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    test_instance = Test()\n    result = test_instance.method()\n    print(\"Result from method_actual:\", result)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n1. **Profiling with `cProfile.Profile`:** We use `cProfile.Profile` to create a profiler instance. This instance can be started and stopped explicitly using `enable()` and `disable()`, giving us control over the profiling lifecycle.\n\n2. **Capturing Return Value:** We call `method_actual()` while the profiler is enabled and capture the return value in a variable (`result`). This way, we profile the execution without needing to call the method multiple times.\n\n3. **Output Profiling Data:** We use the `pstats` module to print out the profiling statistics. You can customize this to save to a file if needed, by redirecting the output stream.\n\n4. **Thread Safety:** This approach is thread-safe as long as `method_actual` is thread-safe. The profiling itself doesn't introduce any thread safety issues.\n\nBy following this approach, you can profile your methods while retaining the ability to return computed values seamlessly."
