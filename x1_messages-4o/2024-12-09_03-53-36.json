        "content": "The issue of log messages appearing twice is a common problem when dealing with the Python logging module. This typically happens when multiple handlers are added to the same logger, or when the logger is set up multiple times. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Single Configuration**: Make sure that the `configure_logging` method is called only once. If it's called multiple times, it will add multiple handlers to the logger, resulting in duplicate log messages. This is common if your logging configuration is part of a class and the method gets called multiple times as instances are created.\n\n2. **Check for Existing Handlers**: Before adding handlers to the logger, check if there are existing handlers and remove them. This can prevent the addition of duplicate handlers:\n\n    ```python\n    def configure_logging(self, logging_file):\n        self.logger = logging.getLogger(\"my_logger\")\n        self.logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n        self.logger.propagate = 0\n\n        # Remove all handlers associated with the logger\n        if self.logger.hasHandlers():\n            self.logger.handlers.clear()\n\n        formatter = logging.Formatter(\"%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s\")\n\n        ch = logging.StreamHandler()\n        ch.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n        ch.setFormatter(formatter)\n        self.logger.addHandler(ch)\n\n        fh = logging.FileHandler(logging_file)\n        fh.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n        fh.setFormatter(formatter)\n        self.logger.addHandler(fh)\n    ```\n\n3. **Avoid Global Logger Conflicts**: If you're using the root logger elsewhere in your code, ensure that it is not interfering with your custom logger.\n\n4. **Check for External Logging Calls**: If other parts of the code or libraries you're using also configure logging, make sure they aren't adding handlers to the same logger.\n\nBy ensuring that handlers are not added multiple times and by clearing existing handlers before setting up new ones, you should be able to resolve the issue of duplicate log messages."
