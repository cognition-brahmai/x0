One of the simplest ways to do this is by using the `str.format()` method. Here's how you can modify your print statement to achieve the desired format:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Total score for ({}) is ({})\".format(name, score))\n```\n\nThis will replace `{}` placeholders with the `name` and `score` variables, respectively, resulting in the output: \"Total score for (name) is (score)\".\n\nAlternatively, if you are using Python 3.6 or later, you can also use f-strings for more concise and readable code:\n\n```python\nprint(f\"Total score for ({name}) is ({score})\")\n```\n\nHowever, since you're using Python 3.3, you'll need to stick with the `str.format()` method."
