I want to retrain a pre-trained model, like the COCO dataset model that has 90 classes, by adding 1 or 2 new classes to get a 92 class object detection model. The repository provides instructions on running locally but it completely replaces the pre-trained classes with newly trained classes. Is there a method to retain the existing classes and add new ones to the model?"

        "content": "Fine-tuning a pre-trained TensorFlow Object Detection model to recognize additional classes while retaining the existing ones involves a few key steps. Here\u2019s a general approach to achieve this using TensorFlow's Object Detection API:\n\n### Prerequisites:\n\n1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure you have TensorFlow and the Object Detection API installed. Follow the [installation instructions](https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) provided by the official documentation.\n\n2. **Pre-trained Model**: Download a pre-trained model from the TensorFlow Model Zoo that suits your needs, such as one trained on the COCO dataset.\n\n### Steps to Fine-tune:\n\n1. **Dataset Preparation**:\n    - **Collect Data**: Gather images and annotations for your new classes. Use tools like LabelImg or VGG Image Annotator for annotation.\n    - **Format Data**: Convert your annotations to the TFRecord format expected by the TensorFlow Object Detection API. Ensure that your label map includes both the existing COCO classes and your new classes.\n\n2. **Modify the Label Map**:\n    - Locate the label map file for the pre-trained model you are using (usually a `.pbtxt` file).\n    - Add entries for your new classes, making sure the ID numbers do not conflict with existing ones.\n\n3. **Config File Adjustments**:\n    - Download the pipeline configuration file for your chosen model from the TensorFlow Model Zoo.\n    - Update the `num_classes` parameter to reflect the total number of classes (original classes + new classes).\n    - Adjust the `fine_tune_checkpoint` path to point to the pre-trained model's checkpoint you downloaded.\n    - Modify the `train_input_reader` and `eval_input_reader` sections to point to your new dataset's TFRecord files and label map.\n\n4. **Model Training**:\n    - Use the `model_main_tf2.py` script provided by the TensorFlow Object Detection API to start training. Pass the path to your modified configuration file.\n    - Example command:\n      ```bash\n      python model_main_tf2.py --pipeline_config_path=path/to/your_config_file.config --model_dir=path/to/output_directory --alsologtostderr\n      ```\n\n5. **Evaluation**:\n    - Continuously monitor the training process. You can use TensorBoard to visualize the training process and ensure that the model is learning.\n\n6. **Export the Model**:\n    - Once training is complete, export the trained model using the `exporter_main_v2.py` script. This will create a SavedModel that can be deployed for inference.\n\n7. **Testing**:\n    - Test the model on images containing both the original and new classes to verify that it correctly detects all classes.\n\n### Tips:\n\n- **Learning Rate**: When fine-tuning, using a lower learning rate can help retain knowledge from the pre-trained model.\n- **Data Augmentation**: Consider using data augmentation techniques to improve the model's robustness.\n- **Balanced Dataset**: Ensure that your dataset is well-balanced to prevent the model from being biased towards any particular class.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to add new classes to an existing TensorFlow Object Detection model while retaining its ability to recognize the original classes."
