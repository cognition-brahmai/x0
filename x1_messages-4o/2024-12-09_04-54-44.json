For instance, to get the maximum F1-score, I use the following code:\n\n```python\n# AUCPR\nprecision, recall, thresholds = sklearn.metrics.precision_recall_curve(y_true, y_score)    \nauprc  = sklearn.metrics.auc(recall, precision)\nmax_f1 = 0\nfor r, p, t in zip(recall, precision, thresholds):\n    if p + r == 0: continue\n    if (2*p*r)/(p + r) > max_f1:\n        max_f1 = (2*p*r)/(p + r) \n        max_f1_threshold = t\n```\n\nTo compute the maximum accuracy, I follow a similar approach:\n\n```python\naccuracies = []\nthresholds = np.arange(0,1,0.1)\nfor threshold in thresholds:\n    y_pred = np.greater(y_score, threshold).astype(int)\n    accuracy = sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)\n    accuracies.append(accuracy)\n\naccuracies = np.array(accuracies)\nmax_accuracy = accuracies.max() \nmax_accuracy_threshold =  thresholds[accuracies.argmax()]\n```\n\nI am wondering if there is a built-in function for this."

        "content": "As of my last update, scikit-learn does not have a built-in function specifically designed to directly compute the maximum accuracy for a binary probabilistic classifier across different thresholds. However, your approach of iterating over thresholds to find the maximum accuracy is commonly used and efficient.\n\nThe key reason why this isn't built into scikit-learn is because accuracy is typically less informative for imbalanced datasets compared to precision-recall or ROC curves, which is why more emphasis is placed on metrics like AUC-ROC and AUC-PR.\n\nThat said, you can streamline your approach a bit using numpy and scikit-learn functions. Here's a slightly optimized version of your code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n\n# Define thresholds\nthresholds = np.arange(0, 1, 0.01)  # Finer granularity might give better results\n\n# Initialize variables to store the best accuracy and corresponding threshold\nmax_accuracy = 0\nmax_accuracy_threshold = 0\n\n# Iterate over thresholds to find the maximum accuracy\nfor threshold in thresholds:\n    y_pred = np.greater(y_score, threshold).astype(int)\n    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)\n    if accuracy > max_accuracy:\n        max_accuracy = accuracy\n        max_accuracy_threshold = threshold\n\n# max_accuracy and max_accuracy_threshold will have the values that give the best accuracy\n```\n\nThis code increases the granularity of the threshold steps, which might provide a more precise maximum accuracy value. If your dataset is particularly large or the computation is slow, you might need to balance between threshold step size and computation time.\n\nIn practice, it's important to consider whether maximizing accuracy is the right choice for your specific problem, especially if your classes are imbalanced. Other metrics might provide more insight and lead to a more robust model."
