Despite his serious name, he was known for having a great sense of humor. He owned a bakery as a side business, and his specialty was pies. His shop, cleverly named \"Pi\u2019s Pies,\" was always bustling with customers eager to try his mouthwatering creations.\n\nOne day, a curious customer walked in and asked, \"Dr. Pi, why are your pies always perfectly round?\"\n\nWith a twinkle in his eye, Dr. Pi replied, \"Well, you see, in my world, the circumference is always a-round!\"\n\nThe customer chuckled and said, \"I guess you could say your pies are truly... 'well-rounded'!\"\n\nDr. Pi grinned, \"Exactly! And if you ever wonder about the volume, just remember: all my pies are filled with deliciousness to the 'r-squared'!\"\n\nFrom that day on, \"Pi\u2019s Pies\" not only became famous for its delicious treats but also for the mathematical humor that came with every slice. Customers would leave with both a full stomach and a smile, knowing they had just been served by the punniest mathematician in town."
