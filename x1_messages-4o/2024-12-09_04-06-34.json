        "content": "The error you're encountering suggests that there might be a syntax issue or misuse of functions in your code. The code you've shown should generally work for filtering a DataFrame based on whether a column contains a specific substring. However, let's make sure everything is set up correctly. Here's the correct approach to filter rows where the `location` column contains the substring 'google.com':\n\n```python\nimport pyspark.sql.functions as sf\n\n# Assuming df is your DataFrame\nfiltered_df = df.filter(sf.col('location').contains('google.com'))\n\n# Show the first 5 rows of the filtered DataFrame\nfiltered_df.show(5)\n```\n\nIf you are still encountering the same error, it might be due to how the DataFrame or the Spark session is initialized. Here are a few things to check:\n\n1. **Ensure Spark Session is properly initialized**:\n   Make sure you have a Spark session created before trying to work with DataFrames.\n\n   ```python\n   from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n\n   spark = SparkSession.builder \\\n       .appName(\"FilterExample\") \\\n       .getOrCreate()\n   ```\n\n2. **Check for any other code issues**:\n   Ensure that `df` is indeed a PySpark DataFrame and that there are no other syntactical issues in your code.\n\n3. **Incorrect import or function name**: \n   Double-check that `sf.col` is correctly imported from `pyspark.sql.functions`.\n\nTry running the corrected code snippet above. If the issue persists, provide more details about the error message or any additional context, and we can troubleshoot further."
