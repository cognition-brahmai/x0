I am trying to create a setup.py file where find_packages() recursively identifies packages like 'foo', 'bar', and 'baz' so they can be installed and available on the Python path. However, when I run python setup.py install or python setup.py sdist, only the 'baz' directory is identified and packaged. Is there a way to extend the search path or manually hard-code the search path of the find_packages()?\n\nBelow is my current directory structure:\n\n```\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 bar-pack\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 bar\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 baz\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 foo-pack\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 foo\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 setup.py\n```\n\nAnd this is my current setup.py file:\n\n```\nfrom setuptools import setup, find_packages\nsetup(\n    name=\"mypackage\",\n    version=\"0.1\",\n    packages=find_packages(),\n)\n```\n\nWhen I try to simplify it down further, and run the following command, only 'baz' is identified: \n\n```\npython -c \"from setuptools import setup, find_packages; print(find_packages())\"\n['baz']\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're facing is due to the directory structure of your packages. The `find_packages()` function in `setuptools` is designed to look for packages in the same directory as the `setup.py` file, and it assumes that packages are directly subdirectories of that directory. In your case, since `foo` and `bar` are nested within `foo-pack` and `bar-pack` respectively, they are not being recognized as packages.\n\nTo address this, you have a couple of options:\n\n### Option 1: Update Directory Structure\n\nIf possible, you can flatten your directory structure so that all packages are direct subdirectories of the root directory. For example:\n\n```\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 bar\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 baz\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 foo\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 setup.py\n```\n\nWith this structure, `find_packages()` should be able to identify all packages correctly.\n\n### Option 2: Use `include` Argument in `find_packages()`\n\nIf restructuring your directories is not feasible, you can explicitly tell `find_packages()` which directories to consider as packages using the `include` argument. You can manually specify the paths to your packages:\n\n```python\nfrom setuptools import setup, find_packages\n\nsetup(\n    name=\"mypackage\",\n    version=\"0.1\",\n    packages=find_packages(include=['baz', 'foo-pack.foo', 'bar-pack.bar']),\n)\n```\n\nThis approach allows you to manually specify which directories should be treated as packages, without changing your directory structure.\n\n### Option 3: Custom Package Discovery\n\nIf you have a complex structure or want more control, you can define a custom function to discover packages and pass the list of packages to the `setup()` function:\n\n```python\nfrom setuptools import setup, find_packages\nimport os\n\ndef find_subpackages(base_dir):\n    packages = []\n    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(base_dir):\n        if '__init__.py' in files:\n            package = os.path.relpath(root, base_dir).replace(os.path.sep, '.')\n            packages.append(package)\n    return packages\n\nsetup(\n    name=\"mypackage\",\n    version=\"0.1\",\n    packages=find_subpackages('.'),\n)\n```\n\nThis custom function will recursively search for directories containing an `__init__.py` file and treat them as packages.\n\nChoose the option that best fits your needs based on how your project is structured and your preferences for maintaining it."
