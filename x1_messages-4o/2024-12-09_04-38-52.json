        "content": "The error you're encountering indicates that the `libmemcached` library is not installed or not found on your system. To resolve this issue, you'll need to ensure that `libmemcached` is installed and properly configured. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you install `libmemcached` and then successfully install `pylibmc`:\n\n1. **Install Homebrew** (if you haven't already):\n   Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that will help you easily install `libmemcached`. You can install Homebrew by running the following command in your terminal:\n   ```bash\n   /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Install libmemcached**:\n   Once Homebrew is installed, you can install `libmemcached` using the following command:\n   ```bash\n   brew install libmemcached\n   ```\n\n3. **Set Environment Variables** (optional):\n   Sometimes, you might need to set the `CPATH` and `LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables to help the compiler find `libmemcached`. You can do this by adding the following lines to your shell profile file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.):\n   ```bash\n   export CPATH=\"/usr/local/include:$CPATH\"\n   export LIBRARY_PATH=\"/usr/local/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH\"\n   ```\n   After adding these lines, make sure to source your profile file by running `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc`.\n\n4. **Install pylibmc**:\n   Now, try installing `pylibmc` again using pip:\n   ```bash\n   pip install pylibmc\n   ```\n\nThese steps should help resolve the issue by ensuring that the necessary `libmemcached` headers and libraries are available for `pylibmc` to compile correctly. If you encounter any further issues, make sure to check the installation paths and verify that the environment variables are set correctly."
