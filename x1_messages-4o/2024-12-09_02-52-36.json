The 'collectstatic' command is failing in my development environment while post-processing 'css/iconic/open-iconic-bootstrap.css', and I receive a ValueError indicating that the file 'css/fonts/open-iconic.eot' cannot be found with <whitenoise.django.GzipManifestStaticFilesStorage>. However, when I comment out the line `STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'whitenoise.django.GzipManifestStaticFilesStorage'` in my settings, the static collection command runs without any problems. I have already tried emptying my static file output folder, but the command only runs smoothly until it starts processing the specific file. What could be the issue here and how can I resolve it?"

        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "The issue you're encountering is likely related to the way `GzipManifestStaticFilesStorage` handles static files. This storage backend attempts to find and compress all referenced files, including fonts and other assets, which can lead to issues if any files are missing or incorrectly referenced in your CSS.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check File Paths in CSS**: Make sure that all paths in your CSS files correctly reference existing files. Double-check the path to `open-iconic.eot` and ensure it matches the actual file location within your project.\n\n2. **Verify File Existence**: Ensure that the `open-iconic.eot` file actually exists in your static files directories and is accessible.\n\n3. **Update Static Files Configuration**: If the file paths are correct and the files exist, try updating your `STATICFILES_DIRS` and `STATIC_ROOT` settings to ensure they correctly include all necessary directories.\n\n4. **Exclude Non-Existent Files**: If certain files are not needed, consider removing or commenting out the corresponding references in your CSS files.\n\n5. **Check for Typos**: Make sure there are no typos in your CSS paths or any other configuration settings related to static files.\n\n6. **Use a Different Storage Backend**: If the issue persists, consider using a different storage backend like `WhiteNoiseStorage` instead of `GzipManifestStaticFilesStorage`. You can use:\n   ```python\n   STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage'\n   ```\n\n7. **Update Dependencies**: Ensure all your frontend dependencies (like `open-iconic`) are updated to the latest versions. There might be fixes related to path issues in newer versions.\n\n8. **Run Collectstatic Locally**: Try running the `collectstatic` command locally with the `--noinput` flag to see if it provides additional context about the issue:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py collectstatic --noinput\n   ```\n\n9. **Debugging**: Add more verbosity to the command to see detailed output which can help in identifying the missing file:\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py collectstatic --noinput -v 3\n   ```\n\n10. **Logging**: Check your logs for any additional errors or warnings that might indicate what's going wrong.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify the root cause of the problem and resolve the issue with serving static files using WhiteNoise on Heroku."
