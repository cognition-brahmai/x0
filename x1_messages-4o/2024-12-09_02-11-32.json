Each row represents a taxi pickup in a specified neighborhood and borough. I am attempting to find the top 5 neighborhoods in each borough with the highest number of pickups. I have tried using the groupby function and value_counts in pandas, but I am struggling to filter the results to only show the top 5 neighborhoods for each borough. How can I modify my approach to achieve the desired outcome?"

        "content": "To find the top 5 neighborhoods in each borough with the highest number of taxi pickups, you can use the `groupby` function along with `apply`, `nlargest`, or `head`. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this in pandas:\n\n1. **Group by Borough and Neighborhood**: First, you need to group the data by both 'Borough' and 'Neighborhood' to count the number of pickups in each neighborhood within each borough.\n\n2. **Sort and Filter**: Use `nlargest` or `apply` with `head` to get the top 5 neighborhoods per borough based on the number of pickups.\n\nHere's a code example to demonstrate this process:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample DataFrame\ndata = {\n    'Neighborhood': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'D', 'E', 'F'],\n    'Borough': ['X', 'X', 'X', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Z', 'Z', 'Z', 'X', 'X', 'Y', 'Y', 'Z', 'Z']\n}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Count the number of pickups for each neighborhood in each borough\npickup_counts = df.groupby(['Borough', 'Neighborhood']).size().reset_index(name='Pickups')\n\n# Find the top 5 neighborhoods with most pickups in each borough\ntop_neighborhoods = pickup_counts.groupby('Borough').apply(lambda x: x.nlargest(5, 'Pickups')).reset_index(drop=True)\n\nprint(top_neighborhoods)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Step 1**: We group the data by 'Borough' and 'Neighborhood' and use `size()` to count the number of occurrences, which we rename to 'Pickups' using `reset_index`.\n\n- **Step 2**: We then group by 'Borough' again and apply a lambda function to each group that uses `nlargest` to find the top 5 neighborhoods based on the 'Pickups' count.\n\n- **reset_index(drop=True)**: This is used to get a clean DataFrame without the extra index levels added by `groupby`.\n\nThis code will give you a DataFrame with the top 5 neighborhoods for each borough based on the number of pickups. If there are fewer than 5 neighborhoods in a borough, it will return all neighborhoods for that borough."
