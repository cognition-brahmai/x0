The error message begins with \"Warning: the environment variable LANG is not set!

Then, when creating a Pipfile for this project, I encounter a TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable. I have attempted to set the LANG in ~/.profile and ~/.bash_profile, but neither method has resolved the issue. How can I successfully run the command?"

        "content": "The error you're encountering is related to locale settings on your macOS system. The message indicates that the `LANG` environment variable is not set correctly, which can lead to issues with Python's encoding expectations. Here's a step-by-step guide to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Your Shell Configuration Files:**\n\n   You mentioned trying to set `LANG` in `~/.profile` and `~/.bash_profile`. Ensure that you're using the correct configuration file for your shell. If you're using `zsh`, which is the default shell in recent macOS versions, you should edit `~/.zshrc` instead.\n\n2. **Set the Correct Locale:**\n\n   Open your terminal and edit the appropriate configuration file (e.g., `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.profile`) using a text editor like `nano` or `vim`. For example:\n\n   ```bash\n   nano ~/.zshrc\n   ```\n\n   Add the following lines to set the locale:\n\n   ```bash\n   export LANG=en_US.UTF-8\n   export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8\n   ```\n\n   Save the file and exit the editor.\n\n3. **Apply the Changes:**\n\n   After editing the configuration file, make sure to apply the changes. You can do so by sourcing the file:\n\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.zshrc\n   ```\n\n   Or, if you used `~/.bash_profile`, you'd run:\n\n   ```bash\n   source ~/.bash_profile\n   ```\n\n4. **Verify the Locale Settings:**\n\n   To ensure the locale settings are correct, run the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```bash\n   locale\n   ```\n\n   This should output the locale settings, and you should see `LANG=en_US.UTF-8` and `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8`.\n\n5. **Retry the Pipenv Command:**\n\n   Now that the locale is set correctly, try running your original command again:\n\n   ```bash\n   pipenv install requests\n   ```\n\n6. **Reinstall Pipenv (Optional):**\n\n   If you still encounter issues, consider reinstalling `pipenv` to ensure there are no installation-related problems:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip uninstall pipenv\n   pip install pipenv\n   ```\n\nFollowing these steps should help resolve the locale-related error and allow you to successfully run the `pipenv install requests` command."
