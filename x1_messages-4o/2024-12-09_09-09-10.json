        "content": "To create a MySQL table that can store data for blog posts including the title, text, author, and date published, you can use the following SQL code:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE BlogPosts (\n    PostID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\n    Title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n    Content TEXT NOT NULL,\n    Author VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,\n    DatePublished DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the table structure:\n\n- `PostID`: An integer field that serves as the primary key for the table. It is set to auto-increment, so each new blog post will automatically receive a unique identifier.\n- `Title`: A variable character field (up to 255 characters) for storing the title of the blog post. It is marked as `NOT NULL`, meaning a title is required for each entry.\n- `Content`: A text field for storing the main content of the blog post. This field can hold large amounts of text data.\n- `Author`: A variable character field (up to 100 characters) for storing the author's name. It is also marked as `NOT NULL`.\n- `DatePublished`: A datetime field that captures the date and time when the blog post was published. It defaults to the current timestamp at the time of insertion.\n\nYou can adjust the sizes and types of these fields according to your specific requirements."
