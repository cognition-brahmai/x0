In the following, I have listed the five major steps in the design process of a software system in the form of an excel table. Could you please mention these five steps?\n| Step No. | Step Name | Description |\n| --------| -----------| ----------- |\n| 1 | Requirement gathering | Collecting and analyzing information about the user's needs and requirements. |\n| 2 | System analysis | Defining the functionalities of the software system, creating the specifications, and identifying the system's constraints. |\n| 3 | Designing the system architecture | Creating the system's high-level design and deciding how different components will interact with each other. |\n| 4 | Detailed design | Defining the low-level design of the system and documenting the internal structure of the software. |\n| 5 | Implementation and testing | Writing the code, integrating the different components, and testing the system's functionalities to ensure they work as expected. |"

It focuses on deciding how different components will interact with each other and ensures that the architecture supports the requirements and constraints identified in earlier phases.\n\n4. **Detailed Design**: This involves defining the low-level design and documenting the internal structure of the software. It covers the specifics of how individual components will be implemented and how they will work together within the system.\n\n5. **Implementation and Testing**: In this step, the actual coding takes place. The different components are integrated, and the system is tested to ensure that all functionalities work as expected and meet the defined requirements."
