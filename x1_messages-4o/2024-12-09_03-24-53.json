However, I'm encountering a problem. Here's my code:\n\n```python\nimport threading\nsem = threading.Semaphore()\n\ndef fun1():\n    while True:\n        sem.acquire()\n        print(1)\n        sem.release()\n\ndef fun2():\n    while True:\n        sem.acquire()\n        print(2)\n        sem.release()\n\nt = threading.Thread(target = fun1)\nt.start()\nt2 = threading.Thread(target = fun2)\nt2.start()\n```\n\nMy issue is that it keeps printing just 1's. I'm not sure how to interleave the prints between the two functions. Could anyone provide some guidance?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is due to the way the semaphore is being used in your code. The semaphore is being acquired and released immediately within each function, so the thread that acquires it first can continue running, often repeatedly, before the operating system scheduler switches to the other thread. This behavior can lead to one thread dominating the output, as you've observed with the continuous printing of 1's.\n\nTo achieve interleaving between the two threads, you may want to consider using a more controlled approach where each thread signals the other to proceed. You can use two semaphores to coordinate the execution order between the threads.\n\nHere's an updated version of your code that uses two semaphores to alternate the execution between `fun1` and `fun2`:\n\n```python\nimport threading\n\n# Initialize semaphores\nsem1 = threading.Semaphore(1)  # Start with 1 to allow fun1 to run first\nsem2 = threading.Semaphore(0)  # Start with 0 to block fun2 initially\n\ndef fun1():\n    while True:\n        sem1.acquire()  # Wait for permission to print\n        print(1)\n        sem2.release()  # Allow fun2 to print\n\ndef fun2():\n    while True:\n        sem2.acquire()  # Wait for permission to print\n        print(2)\n        sem1.release()  # Allow fun1 to print\n\n# Create and start threads\nt1 = threading.Thread(target=fun1)\nt2 = threading.Thread(target=fun2)\n\nt1.start()\nt2.start()\n```\n\nIn this setup:\n- `sem1` is initialized to 1, allowing `fun1` to run first.\n- `sem2` is initialized to 0, blocking `fun2` from running until `fun1` releases it.\n- After `fun1` prints, it releases `sem2`, allowing `fun2` to run and print.\n- `fun2` then releases `sem1`, allowing `fun1` to run again, creating an interleaving print of 1 and 2.\n\nThis approach should give you the desired interleaved output."
