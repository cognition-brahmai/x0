This has happened with a couple of tests now and I'm not sure what my next steps should be. Do you have any idea what could be causing this?"

        "content": "The issue you're experiencing is due to the fact that your test method `printsTrue` is not being recognized as a test by the `unittest` framework. In the `unittest` framework, test method names must start with the prefix `test`. This is how the framework identifies which methods are test cases to be executed.\n\nYou can fix the issue by renaming your test method from `printsTrue` to something that starts with `test`, like `test_printsTrue`. Here's the corrected code:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\n\nclass Prueba(unittest.TestCase):\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        pass\n\n    def test_printsTrue(self):\n        self.assertTrue(True)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\nWith this change, when you run your script, the test should be recognized and executed:\n\n```shell\n$ python testito.py\n.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nRan 1 test in 0.000s\n\nOK\n```\n\nThis output indicates that one test was run and it passed successfully."
