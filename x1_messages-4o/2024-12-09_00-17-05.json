The code I currently have is as follows: `dates = soup.findAll(\"div\", {\"id\" : \"date\"})`. However, the id can vary as 'date_1', 'date_2' and so on. How can I modify this code to allow for a wildcard search in the id?"

        "content": "To perform a wildcard search for `id` attributes that start with a specific pattern, you can use a regular expression with BeautifulSoup's `find_all` method. You can achieve this by using the `re` module in combination with BeautifulSoup. Here's how you can modify your code to find all `div` elements where the `id` attribute starts with \"date\":\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n# Your HTML content\nhtml_content = \"\"\"\n<div id=\"date_1\">Content 1</div>\n<div id=\"date_2\">Content 2</div>\n<div id=\"other\">Other Content</div>\n\"\"\"\n\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')\n\n# Use a regular expression to match ids starting with 'date'\ndates = soup.find_all(\"div\", id=re.compile(r\"^date_\\d+\"))\n\n# Print the results\nfor date in dates:\n    print(date)\n```\n\nIn this code, `re.compile(r\"^date_\\d+\")` creates a regular expression that matches any string starting with \"date_\" followed by one or more digits (`\\d+`). The `^` at the beginning of the pattern ensures that the match is anchored to the start of the string. This approach will help you find all `div` elements with `id` attributes like 'date_1', 'date_2', etc."
