        "content": "John wants to save 30% of his income after paying rent. First, let's calculate how much money he wants to save each month:\n\n\\[ \\text{Savings} = 30\\% \\text{ of income} = 0.3 \\times \\$5,000 = \\$1,500 \\]\n\nNext, determine how much money John has available to spend after saving:\n\n\\[ \\text{Amount available for rent and other expenses} = \\$5,000 - \\$1,500 = \\$3,500 \\]\n\nSince John wants to know the percentage of his income he can spend on rent, and he has $3,500 available for rent and other expenses, he can potentially spend up to $3,500 on rent. However, we know that he is looking to spend as much as possible while still saving 30%.\n\nTherefore, the maximum he can spend on rent, without affecting his savings goal, is the remaining amount after savings. \n\n\\[ \\text{Percentage of income spent on rent} = \\left(\\frac{\\$2,000}{\\$5,000}\\right) \\times 100\\% = 40\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, John can spend 40% of his income on rent to meet his savings goal."
