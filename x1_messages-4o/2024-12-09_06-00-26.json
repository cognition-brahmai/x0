When I try to import just the file with `from folder import file`, I get another error `NameError: name 'Klasa' is not defined` when trying to instantiate the class. I have tried creating an empty `__init__.py` file in the subdirectory and importing the class there, but the error persists. The import works when 'main.py' and 'file.py' are in the same directory with `from file import Klasa`, but I want them to be in separate directories. What am I doing wrong?"

        "content": "It sounds like you're encountering a common issue with Python's import system when dealing with subdirectories. Let's address the problem by clarifying your import statements and ensuring your project structure is set up correctly.\n\nGiven your project structure:\n\n```\n> main.py\n> --- > folder/\n> ----- > file.py\n```\n\nTo import the class `Klasa` from `file.py` in `main.py`, you need to make sure that Python recognizes `folder` as a package. You've mentioned creating an `__init__.py` file in the `folder` directory, which is the right step. This file can be empty, but its presence indicates to Python that `folder` is a package.\n\nHere's how you can correctly import `Klasa`:\n\n1. **Ensure `__init__.py` is in the `folder` directory:**\n\n   Your directory should look like this:\n\n   ```\n   > main.py\n   > --- > folder/\n   > ----- > __init__.py\n   > ----- > file.py\n   ```\n\n2. **Modify your import statement in `main.py`:**\n\n   Instead of trying to import `file` and then `Klasa` separately, you can directly import `Klasa` from the module `file` within the package `folder`:\n\n   ```python\n   from folder.file import Klasa\n   ```\n\n3. **Check Python Path:**\n\n   Ensure that your current working directory is set correctly when you run `main.py`. If you're running the script from the root of your project, it should work fine. You can check your working directory by printing it:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   print(os.getcwd())\n   ```\n\n4. **Run the script:**\n\n   Execute your script from the root directory of your project where `main.py` is located, like this:\n\n   ```bash\n   python main.py\n   ```\n\nThis setup should resolve your import issues, allowing you to use `Klasa` in `main.py` without any errors."
