The differences between consecutive numbers are:\n   - 10 - 5 = 5\n   - 17 - 10 = 7\n   - 26 - 17 = 9\n   - 37 - 26 = 11\n\nNotice that the differences themselves seem to increase by 2 each time. Let's continue this pattern to find the next difference:\n\n3. Next difference: 11 + 2 = 13\n\nNow, add this difference to the last known number in the sequence:\n\n4. 37 + 13 = 50\n\nThus, the missing number in the sequence is 50. Therefore, the complete sequence is:\n\n5, 10, 17, 26, 37, 50, 65, 82"
