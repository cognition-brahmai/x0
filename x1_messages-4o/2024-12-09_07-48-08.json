For example, if the system time is \"2011-9-28 06:11:30\", I would like to get the output as \"2011-9-28 05\", which is one hour earlier. In order to achieve this, I have used the following code:\n\n```python\nlastHourDateTime = date.today() - timedelta(hours = 1)\nprint lastHourDateTime.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')\n```\n\nHowever, the output is not showing the time part at all. Can you help me identify where I am going wrong?"

        "content": "The issue in your code is that you are using `date.today()` which returns a date object that does not include time information. To get the current date and time, you should use `datetime.now()` instead. Here's the corrected code:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Get the current datetime\ncurrentDateTime = datetime.now()\n\n# Subtract one hour\nlastHourDateTime = currentDateTime - timedelta(hours=1)\n\n# Format the datetime to show only the year, month, day, and hour\nprint(lastHourDateTime.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H'))\n```\n\nThis will give you the output in the format you desire, displaying the year, month, day, and one hour earlier than the current time."
