I have attempted to use `SET PYTHONPATH=...` under a virtualenv command prompt, but this sets the variable for the entire environment instead of just the desired virtualenv. What's the correct way to achieve my goal?"

        "content": "To set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable so that it is only applicable within a specific virtualenv, you can use the following approach:\n\n1. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**\n   First, ensure your virtual environment is activated. You can activate it with the following command:\n\n   - On Windows:\n     ```\n     .\\env\\Scripts\\activate\n     ```\n   - On macOS or Linux:\n     ```\n     source env/bin/activate\n     ```\n\n   Replace `env` with the name of your virtual environment.\n\n2. **Set the PYTHONPATH:**\n   Once your virtualenv is activated, you can set the `PYTHONPATH` by adding it to the `activate` script or by creating a `.env` or `activate_this.py` script inside your virtualenv directory. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n   **Option 1: Modify the activate script**\n   \n   - Locate the `activate` script in your virtualenv directory.\n   - Open this script in a text editor.\n   - Add the following line at the end of the script:\n\n     - On Windows:\n       ```batch\n       set PYTHONPATH=your_path;%PYTHONPATH%\n       ```\n     - On macOS or Linux:\n       ```bash\n       export PYTHONPATH=your_path:$PYTHONPATH\n       ```\n\n   Replace `your_path` with the actual path you want to add.\n\n   **Option 2: Use a `.env` or `activate_this.py` script**\n\n   - Create a new file named `.env` or `activate_this.py` within your virtualenv directory.\n   - Add the following line to this file:\n\n     ```bash\n     export PYTHONPATH=\"your_path:$PYTHONPATH\"\n     ```\n\n   - Ensure that this file is sourced or executed when you activate your virtual environment.\n\n3. **Reactivate the Virtual Environment:**\n   If you modified the `activate` script, deactivate and then reactivate your virtual environment for the changes to take effect.\n\n   - To deactivate:\n     ```\n     deactivate\n     ```\n\n   - Then activate again:\n     ```\n     source env/bin/activate\n     ```\n\nBy following these steps, the `PYTHONPATH` variable will be set only when the specific virtual environment is activated, thereby keeping it isolated from other environments."
