I am struggling to find the correct operator to use for this check. An example of what I'm trying to achieve is shown below:\n```bash\nif [ $string ?? 'foo' ]; then\n  echo \"It's there!\"\nfi\n```\nHere, `??` represents the unknown operator that I'm trying to find. I have tried using `echo` and `grep` as shown below:\n```bash\nif echo \"$string\" | grep 'foo'; then\n  echo \"It's there!\"\nfi\n```\nHowever, this approach seems a bit clumsy to me. Is there a more elegant way to check if a string contains a substring in Bash?"

        "content": "In Bash, a more elegant way to check if a string contains a substring is to use the `[[ ]]` construct with the `=~` operator for regular expression matching. This makes your script cleaner and more readable compared to using `echo` and `grep`. Here is how you can do it:\n\n```bash\nstring=\"My string\"\n\nif [[ $string =~ \"foo\" ]]; then\n  echo \"It's there!\"\nelse\n  echo \"Not found!\"\nfi\n```\n\nIn this example, `[[ $string =~ \"foo\" ]]` checks if `string` contains the substring `\"foo\"`. Note that when using `=~`, you don't need to use quotes around the pattern if it's a simple string without spaces or special characters. However, it's a good practice to include them when dealing with more complex patterns to avoid unexpected behavior. \n\nThis approach is generally preferred for its simplicity and readability in scripts."
