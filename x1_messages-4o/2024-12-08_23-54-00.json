In this case, the premises do not logically lead to the conclusion. Just because all dogs can swim does not mean that only dogs can swim. The ability of the hamster to swim does not imply it is a dog. Therefore, the argument is invalid.\n\n3. **Soundness:**\n   An argument is sound if it is both valid and has true premises. Since the argument is not valid, it cannot be sound. Moreover, the first premise, \"All dogs can swim,\" is also not true as not all dogs can swim.\n\nIn conclusion, the argument is neither valid nor sound."
