For example, given the array:\n\n```python\narray([[3, 2],\n       [6, 2],\n       [3, 6],\n       [3, 4],\n       [5, 3]])\n```\n\nI would like it to be sorted as:\n\n```python\narray([[3, 2],\n       [3, 4],\n       [3, 6],\n       [5, 3],\n       [6, 2]])\n```\n\nIn Python lists, I would usually define a comparator to perform this operation, but numpy's sort function seems not to accept user-defined comparators. Also, could you provide some benchmarking results for the proposed solutions?"

        "content": "To sort a 2D NumPy array by the first column (x-coordinate) and then by the second column (y-coordinate) when the x-coordinates are the same, you can use NumPy's `argsort` function combined with array indexing. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Your initial array\narr = np.array([[3, 2],\n                [6, 2],\n                [3, 6],\n                [3, 4],\n                [5, 3]])\n\n# Get the indices that would sort the array\nsorted_indices = np.lexsort((arr[:, 1], arr[:, 0]))\n\n# Use the sorted indices to sort the array\nsorted_arr = arr[sorted_indices]\n\nprint(sorted_arr)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- `np.lexsort((arr[:, 1], arr[:, 0]))`: `np.lexsort` is used to sort based on multiple keys. It sorts primarily by the last key, secondarily by the second-to-last key, and so on. Therefore, when you pass `(arr[:, 1], arr[:, 0])`, it sorts first by `arr[:, 0]` (x-coordinates), and then by `arr[:, 1]` (y-coordinates) in the case of ties in the x-coordinates.\n\n- `arr[sorted_indices]`: This uses the sorted indices to reorder the original array.\n\n### Benchmarking\n\nTo benchmark this sorting operation, you can use Python's `timeit` module. Here's a simple benchmark:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport timeit\n\n# Function to sort the array\ndef sort_array(arr):\n    sorted_indices = np.lexsort((arr[:, 1], arr[:, 0]))\n    return arr[sorted_indices]\n\n# Create a large array for benchmarking\nlarge_arr = np.random.randint(0, 1000, size=(10000, 2))\n\n# Benchmarking the sorting operation\nexecution_time = timeit.timeit(lambda: sort_array(large_arr), number=100)\nprint(f\"Average execution time over 100 runs: {execution_time / 100:.6f} seconds\")\n```\n\nThis benchmark creates a random array of size (10000, 2) and measures the average time taken to sort it over 100 runs. You can adjust the size and number of runs according to your performance evaluation needs."
