Can I extract the number of adjectives used, the length of sentences, and the use of metaphors or similes? Could you provide an example of how to do this using the given excerpts as input data in the code?\nHere is an example Java code that extracts the number of adjectives and sentence length from two given excerpts:\nimport java.util.regex.Matcher;\nimport java.util.regex.Pattern;\npublic class WritingStyleAnalyzer {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String excerpt1 = \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. It was a bright and sunny day.\";\n        String excerpt2 = \"The lazy dog was jumped over by the quick brown fox. The day was sunny and bright.\";\n        int adjCount1 = countAdjectives(excerpt1);\n        int adjCount2 = countAdjectives(excerpt2);\n        int sentLength1 = getAverageSentenceLength(excerpt1);\n        int sentLength2 = getAverageSentenceLength(excerpt2);\n        System.out.println(\"Excerpt 1 adjective count: \" + adjCount1);\n        System.out.println(\"Excerpt 2 adjective count: \" + adjCount2);\n        System.out.println(\"Excerpt 1 average sentence length: \" + sentLength1);\n        System.out.println(\"Excerpt 2 average sentence length: \" + sentLength2);\n    }\n    private static int countAdjectives(String text) {\n        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(\"\\\\b([A-Z][a-z]*\\\\s)?([A-Z][a-z]*\\\\s)?([A-Z][a-z]*)\\\\b\");\n        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(text);\n        int count = 0;\n        while (matcher.find()) {\n            count++;\n        }\n        return count;\n    }\n    private static int getAverageSentenceLength(String text) {\n        String[] sentences = text.split(\"[.?!]\");\n        int totalLength = 0;\n        for (String sentence : sentences) {\n            totalLength += sentence.trim().split(\"\\\\s+\").length;\n        }\n        return totalLength / sentences.length;\n    }\n}\nThis code extracts the number of adjectives and the average sentence length from two given excerpts. You can modify it to include metaphors or similes by adding additional regular expressions to extract those types of phrases from the text."

        "content": "To expand the Java code to include the detection of metaphors and similes, you can add more sophisticated text processing. Metaphors and similes are more challenging to detect with regular expressions alone, as they often require semantic understanding. However, you can start with a basic pattern for similes, which often use the words \"like\" or \"as.\"\n\nHere's an improved version of the code that includes basic detection for similes:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.regex.Matcher;\nimport java.util.regex.Pattern;\n\npublic class WritingStyleAnalyzer {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String excerpt1 = \"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. It was a bright and sunny day, like a happy dream.\";\n        String excerpt2 = \"The lazy dog was jumped over by the quick brown fox. The day was sunny and bright, as cheerful as a morning song.\";\n\n        int adjCount1 = countAdjectives(excerpt1);\n        int adjCount2 = countAdjectives(excerpt2);\n        int sentLength1 = getAverageSentenceLength(excerpt1);\n        int sentLength2 = getAverageSentenceLength(excerpt2);\n        int simileCount1 = countSimiles(excerpt1);\n        int simileCount2 = countSimiles(excerpt2);\n\n        System.out.println(\"Excerpt 1 adjective count: \" + adjCount1);\n        System.out.println(\"Excerpt 2 adjective count: \" + adjCount2);\n        System.out.println(\"Excerpt 1 average sentence length: \" + sentLength1);\n        System.out.println(\"Excerpt 2 average sentence length: \" + sentLength2);\n        System.out.println(\"Excerpt 1 simile count: \" + simileCount1);\n        System.out.println(\"Excerpt 2 simile count: \" + simileCount2);\n    }\n\n    private static int countAdjectives(String text) {\n        // Simplified pattern for adjectives\n        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(\"\\\\b(?:\\\\w+\\\\s+)?(quick|brown|lazy|bright|sunny|happy|cheerful)\\\\b\");\n        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(text);\n        int count = 0;\n        while (matcher.find()) {\n            count++;\n        }\n        return count;\n    }\n\n    private static int getAverageSentenceLength(String text) {\n        String[] sentences = text.split(\"[.?!]\");\n        int totalLength = 0;\n        for (String sentence : sentences) {\n            totalLength += sentence.trim().split(\"\\\\s+\").length;\n        }\n        return totalLength / sentences.length;\n    }\n\n    private static int countSimiles(String text) {\n        // Basic pattern for similes using \"like\" or \"as\"\n        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(\"\\\\b(like|as)\\\\s+[^.,!?]+\");\n        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(text);\n        int count = 0;\n        while (matcher.find()) {\n            count++;\n        }\n        return count;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Adjective Count:** The `countAdjectives` method uses a simplified pattern that matches specific adjectives known in the text. You can expand this with a more comprehensive list or a part-of-speech tagger for a more robust solution.\n\n2. **Sentence Length:** The `getAverageSentenceLength` method calculates the average number of words per sentence by splitting the text on punctuation marks.\n\n3. **Simile Detection:** The `countSimiles` method looks for patterns involving \"like\" or \"as,\" followed by a phrase, which are common structures for similes.\n\nFor a more advanced analysis, you would need natural language processing (NLP) libraries like Apache OpenNLP, Stanford NLP, or using services such as spaCy (though it's a Python library) to parse and understand the grammatical structure of the text."
