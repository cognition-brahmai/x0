        "content": "To delete a folder named \"test\" and its contents from an Amazon S3 bucket using the `boto3` library in Python, you need to delete each object within the folder individually. In S3, folders are considered as part of the object's key name, so you must delete each object with that prefix.\n\nHere's a sample code to delete the specified folder and its contents:\n\n```python\nimport boto3\n\n# Create a session using your AWS credentials\nsession = boto3.Session(\n    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',\n    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',\n    region_name='YOUR_REGION'  # e.g., 'us-west-2'\n)\n\n# Create an S3 resource\ns3 = session.resource('s3')\n\n# Specify your bucket name\nbucket_name = 'your-bucket-name'\n\n# Specify the folder name\nfolder_name = 'test/'\n\n# Get the bucket\nbucket = s3.Bucket(bucket_name)\n\n# Iterate over the objects with the specified prefix and delete them\nfor obj in bucket.objects.filter(Prefix=folder_name):\n    obj.delete()\n\nprint(f\"The folder '{folder_name}' and its contents have been deleted from the bucket '{bucket_name}'.\")\n```\n\nReplace `'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY'`, `'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'`, `'YOUR_REGION'`, and `'your-bucket-name'` with your actual AWS credentials and bucket details.\n\nThis script will iterate through all objects within the specified folder and delete them. Once you've deleted all objects with the prefix `test/`, the folder will also be considered deleted in S3."
