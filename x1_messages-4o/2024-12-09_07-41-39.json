I am looking for a continually updated display like `pixel[103,214] = 198` for grayscale images or `pixel[103,214] = (138,24,211)` for RGB images. For instance, when I open a grayscale image saved as an ndarray `im` and display it with `imshow` from matplotlib, I get an interactive display of the pixel indices. However, these values are not integers even if I set the display with correct resolution. The `imshow` method from the `spectral` package does a better job of displaying integer pixel indices. However, none of these methods show the pixel values. So, is it possible to coerce `imshow` from `matplotlib` and `imshow` from `scikit-image` into showing the correct integer pixel indices? Moreover, can any of these methods be extended to show the pixel values as well?\n\n```python\nim = plt.imread('image.png')\nplt.imshow(im,cm.gray)\nplt.axis('equal')\n\nimport spectral as spc\nspc.imshow(im)\n```"

        "content": "To achieve the functionality you described, you'll need to create a custom interactive plot using `matplotlib` that can show both the pixel indices and intensities for an image in real-time. This can be done by using event handling in `matplotlib` to track mouse movements and display the pixel information dynamically as you hover over the image.\n\nBelow is an example of how you can implement this:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load your image\nim = plt.imread('image.png')\n\n# Create a figure and axis\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nim_display = ax.imshow(im, cmap='gray' if im.ndim == 2 else None)\n\n# Display pixel indices and intensity on hover\ndef format_coord(x, y):\n    num_rows, num_cols = im.shape[:2]\n    col, row = int(x + 0.5), int(y + 0.5)  # rounding to nearest integer\n    if 0 <= col < num_cols and 0 <= row < num_rows:\n        pixel_value = im[row, col]\n        if im.ndim == 2:  # Grayscale image\n            return f\"pixel[{row},{col}] = {pixel_value}\"\n        else:  # RGB image\n            return f\"pixel[{row},{col}] = ({pixel_value[0]},{pixel_value[1]},{pixel_value[2]})\"\n    else:\n        return \"\"\n\nax.format_coord = format_coord\nplt.axis('equal')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Loading and Displaying Image**: The image is loaded using `plt.imread()` and displayed using `imshow()`. The `cmap='gray'` is set only for grayscale images.\n\n2. **Coordinate Formatting**: The `format_coord` function is defined to format the coordinates and pixel values. This function is called whenever the mouse moves over the image. It rounds the mouse position to the nearest integer indices, checks if they are within bounds, and retrieves the corresponding pixel value.\n\n3. **Event Handling**: `ax.format_coord` is set to our custom `format_coord` function, enabling us to dynamically display the coordinates and pixel values in real-time as the mouse moves over the image.\n\nThis method works with both grayscale and RGB images. If the image has more channels (like RGBA), you can modify the `format_coord` function to display additional channel information if necessary."
