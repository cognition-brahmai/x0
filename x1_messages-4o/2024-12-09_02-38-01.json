One of the columns is the primary key comprised of numbers but is stored as text in Excel (indicated by little green triangle on the top left of the Excel cells). However, when I import the file into a pandas dataframe, the column is imported as a float, where '0614' becomes 614. Is there a way to specify the datatype while importing a column using the `read_excel()` function? I understand this is possible while importing CSV files but couldn't find a similar feature in the `read_excel` syntax. The only workaround I can think of is to add an arbitrary letter at the start of the text (e.g. converting '0614' into 'A0614') in Excel to ensure the column is imported as text, and then removing the 'A' in python, so I can match it with other tables imported from SQL."

        "content": "When importing Excel files using `pandas.read_excel()`, you can explicitly specify the data type for the columns using the `dtype` argument. However, `dtype` is not directly available in the `read_excel` function like it is in `read_csv`. Instead, you can achieve what you need by using the `converters` parameter, which allows you to apply a conversion function to each column.\n\nFor your specific case, where you want to ensure a column is treated as a string, you can use the `converters` parameter to ensure that the data is read as a string. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Define a converter function that converts the input to a string\ndef convert_to_string(value):\n    return str(value)\n\n# Use the converters parameter to specify the conversion for the specific column\ndf = pd.read_excel('your_file.xlsx', converters={'YourColumnName': convert_to_string})\n\n# Now, 'YourColumnName' will be imported as text (string) in the DataFrame\n```\n\nReplace `'YourColumnName'` with the actual name of your primary key column. This approach ensures that the specified column is imported as a string without needing to modify your original Excel file."
