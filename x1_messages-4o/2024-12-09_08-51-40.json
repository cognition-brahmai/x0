        "content": "Certainly! In R, you can use the `head()` function to print the first few rows of a dataframe. Here's a simple code snippet that demonstrates how to print the first five rows of a dataframe:\n\n```r\n# Sample dataframe creation\ndata <- data.frame(\n  Name = c(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\", \"David\", \"Eva\", \"Frank\"),\n  Age = c(25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50),\n  City = c(\"New York\", \"Los Angeles\", \"Chicago\", \"Houston\", \"Phoenix\", \"Philadelphia\")\n)\n\n# Print the first five rows of the dataframe\nfirst_five_rows <- head(data, 5)\nprint(first_five_rows)\n```\n\nThis code creates a sample dataframe with columns for `Name`, `Age`, and `City`. The `head()` function is then used to extract and print the first five rows of this dataframe. You can replace the sample dataframe with your own dataframe as needed."
