Here's how you can rename a file from 'a.txt' to 'b.kml':\n\n```python\nimport os\n\n# Define the original file name and the new file name\noriginal_file_name = 'a.txt'\nnew_file_name = 'b.kml'\n\n# Use the os.rename() method to rename the file\nos.rename(original_file_name, new_file_name)\n\nprint(f\"File renamed from {original_file_name} to {new_file_name}\")\n```\n\nMake sure that the file 'a.txt' exists in the same directory where you are running this script, as the `os.rename()` function will look for the file in the current working directory. If the file is located in a different directory, you'll need to provide the full path to the file."
