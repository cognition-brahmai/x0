I recently updated my Python from 3.3.2 to 3.3.3 and need to reinstall 'pyserial'. Previously, I used to manually download 'pyserial' from pypi, untar pyserial.tgz, navigate to the pyserial directory and then run 'python3 setup.py install'. However, I want to simplify this process and install it like 'pip3 install pyserial'. How can I install pip for Python 3 on Mac OS X so that I can install packages in this simplified manner? I'm not interested in using virtualenv at this point."

        "content": "To install `pip` for Python 3 on your Mac OS X (Mavericks), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Ensure Python 3 is Installed:**\n   First, make sure that Python 3.3 (or your preferred version) is correctly installed. You can check this by running:\n   ```bash\n   python3 --version\n   ```\n\n2. **Download `get-pip.py`:**\n   You need to download the `get-pip.py` script which helps in installing `pip`. You can do this via curl:\n   ```bash\n   curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py\n   ```\n\n3. **Install `pip` for Python 3:**\n   Run the following command to install `pip` using the `get-pip.py` script:\n   ```bash\n   python3 get-pip.py\n   ```\n\n   This will install `pip` for your Python 3.3 installation.\n\n4. **Verify the Installation:**\n   Once the installation is complete, verify that `pip` is installed by checking its version:\n   ```bash\n   pip3 --version\n   ```\n\n5. **Install `pyserial` using `pip3`:**\n   Now that `pip3` is installed, you can easily install `pyserial` by running:\n   ```bash\n   pip3 install pyserial\n   ```\n\nThat's it! You should now have `pip3` installed and be able to install Python packages like `pyserial` using `pip3`."
