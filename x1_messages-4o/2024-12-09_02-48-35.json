I am not getting any error but the graph is not enlarged as per the dimensions provided in `figsize` parameter. Here's my code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas.io.data as web\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n%matplotlib inline\n...\nplt.figure(figsize=(20,10))\ndf2['media']= df2['SPY']*.6 + df2['TLT']*.4\ndf2.plot()\nplt.show()\n```\nWhat could be the issue here preventing the size change of my chart?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with resizing your chart using `matplotlib` might be because of the way you're using the plotting functions. In your code, you're using `plt.figure()` to set the figure size, but then you call `df2.plot()`, which might be creating a new figure and thus not respecting the size you set.\n\nTo resolve this, you can explicitly set the figure size when calling the `plot()` method on your DataFrame. The `plot()` method from pandas' DataFrame has a `figsize` parameter that you can use directly. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas.io.data as web\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# Assuming df2 is your DataFrame\ndf2['media'] = df2['SPY'] * 0.6 + df2['TLT'] * 0.4\n\n# Plotting with specified figure size\ndf2.plot(figsize=(20, 10))\nplt.show()\n```\n\nBy specifying the `figsize` parameter directly in the `plot()` method of the DataFrame, you ensure that the plot is created with the desired dimensions. This should solve the issue of the chart not resizing appropriately."
