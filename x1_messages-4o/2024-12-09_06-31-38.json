        "content": "Why has the function `atomicAdd()` not been implemented for doubles in CUDA version 4.0 or higher? According to the CUDA programming guide 4.1 appendix F page 97, various versions of atomicAdd have been implemented for int, unsigned int, unsigned long long int and float, but not for doubles. Also, the guide provides an implementation of atomicAdd for doubles that I've started to use in my project. So, why isn't this implementation part of CUDA?\n\nThe implemented versions of atomicAdd are as follows:\n\n```cpp\nint atomicAdd(int* address, int val);\nunsigned int atomicAdd(unsigned int* address, unsigned int val);\nunsigned long long int atomicAdd(unsigned long long int* address, unsigned long long int val);\nfloat atomicAdd(float* address, float val)\n```\n\nAnd the implementation for doubles provided in the guide is:\n\n```cpp\n__device__ double atomicAdd(double* address, double val)\n{\n    unsigned long long int* address_as_ull = (unsigned long long int*)address;\n    unsigned long long int old = *address_as_ull, assumed;\n    do {\n        assumed = old;\n        old = atomicCAS(address_as_ull, assumed, __double_as_longlong(val + __longlong_as_double(assumed)));\n    } while (assumed != old);\n    return __longlong_as_double(old);\n}\n```"

        "content": "The absence of `atomicAdd()` for doubles in earlier versions of CUDA, such as 4.0, can be attributed to several factors, primarily stemming from the complexity and performance considerations associated with atomic operations on double-precision floating-point numbers. Here are a few reasons why `atomicAdd()` for doubles wasn't natively implemented:\n\n1. **Hardware Support**: In early CUDA architectures, the hardware may not have had native support for atomic operations on double-precision numbers, making it challenging to implement these operations efficiently. Double-precision arithmetic requires more resources and complexity compared to single-precision, which can affect performance.\n\n2. **Complexity of Atomic Operations**: Atomic operations must ensure that updates to memory are performed without interruption. For doubles, this involves handling 64-bit operations, which can be more complex and slower compared to 32-bit operations (used in `float`).\n\n3. **Performance Considerations**: Atomic operations can become a bottleneck due to their serialized nature. The performance impact is more pronounced for double-precision operations due to the larger data size and the potential lack of hardware optimization in certain architectures.\n\n4. **Use Cases**: Early CUDA versions prioritized operations and data types that were more commonly used in GPU computations at the time. Single-precision floating-point operations and integer operations were more prevalent, making them a priority for optimization and native support.\n\n5. **Alternative Implementations**: As you've noted, the CUDA programming guide provided a software-based implementation for atomic operations on doubles. This allows users who specifically need double-precision atomic operations to implement them via software, albeit with potentially lower performance compared to native support.\n\nIn later CUDA versions, NVIDIA introduced native support for `atomicAdd()` on doubles, starting from CUDA 6.0 with the Kepler architecture, as hardware capabilities improved and the demand for double-precision computations increased. This native support provides better performance and reliability for applications that require double-precision atomic operations.\n\nFor projects requiring atomic operations on doubles in earlier CUDA versions, the provided software-based implementation is a viable alternative, but users should be aware of the potential performance implications."
