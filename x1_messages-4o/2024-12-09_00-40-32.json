However, I'm encountering import errors when I remove the .py source files. This functionality is working in Python 2.7, but not in 3.4 with the new __pycache__ structure. Why can't Python 3.4 import/execute properly given only .pyc files? Is this desired behavior, meaning that the source has to be kept around in all situations?\n\nHere is an example of the problem I'm facing:\n\nOriginal directory structure:\n```\npackage/\n  __init__.py\n  module.py\n```\n\nIn Python 2.7, the following commands run without errors:\n```\n$ python2 -c \"from package import module\"\n$ find package -name \"*.py\" -delete\n$ python2 -c \"from package import module\"\n```\nAnd the directory structure after doing this looks like this:\n```\npackage/\n  __init__.pyc\n  module.pyc\n```\n\nIn Python 3.4, when I run the similar commands, it throws an import error:\n```\n$ python3 -c \"from package import module\"\n$ find package -name \"*.py\" -delete\n$ python3 -c \"from package import module\"\n Traceback (most recent call last):\n   File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\n ImportError: cannot import name 'module'\n```\nThe directory structure at this point looks like this:\n```\npackage/\n  __pycache__/\n      __init__.cpython-34.pyc\n      module.cpython-34.pyc\n```"

        "content": "The issue you're facing with Python 3.4 regarding importing `.pyc` files without the corresponding `.py` source files is related to differences in how Python 3 handles bytecode caches compared to Python 2. Here's a detailed explanation and some solutions:\n\n### Differences in Python 3.x\n\n1. **PEP 3147 - PYC Repository Directories**: Python 3 introduced the `__pycache__` directory to store compiled bytecode files (`.pyc`). This was part of PEP 3147, which aimed to organize bytecode caches more efficiently. The `.pyc` files now include the Python version in their filenames, e.g., `module.cpython-34.pyc`, to prevent conflicts between bytecode files generated by different Python versions.\n\n2. **Import System Changes**: Python 3's import system expects both the `.py` source and the `.pyc` bytecode files to coexist, primarily for validation and regeneration purposes. This is because, by default, Python 3 checks if the `.py` file's timestamp is newer than the `.pyc` file to determine if recompilation is needed.\n\n### Why the Import Error?\n\nWhen you remove the `.py` files in Python 3.4, Python can't validate the `.pyc` files against the source code, which can lead to import errors. It assumes the `.pyc` files might be stale or invalid without the corresponding source validation.\n\n### Solutions\n\n1. **Use `PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX`**: Starting from Python 3.8, you can set the `PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX` environment variable to change the directory where `.pyc` files are stored. This doesn't solve the problem directly but gives you more control over bytecode file locations.\n\n2. **Ensure Proper Execution**: If you're compiling and distributing your application, consider using tools like `PyInstaller`, `cx_Freeze`, or `PyOxidizer`, which bundle Python applications along with their dependencies into standalone executables. This approach eliminates the need for source files.\n\n3. **Use the `zipimport` Module**: As an alternative, you can package your `.pyc` files into a zip archive and use Python's `zipimport` to load modules from there. This requires setting up your modules correctly and ensuring that the zip archive is on the Python path.\n\n4. **Modify Import Hooks**: For advanced users, altering the import system using custom import hooks can allow you to load `.pyc` files without needing `.py` files. However, this approach requires a deep understanding of Python's import system and is generally not recommended for typical use cases.\n\n5. **Use `compileall`**: Ensure that all modules are properly compiled using the `compileall` module, and attempt to run the application with the `-B` flag to prevent Python from trying to write `.pyc` files.\n\nWhile Python 3's behavior regarding imports and bytecode caching aims to enhance reliability and consistency, it can be more restrictive compared to Python 2.7. Using the above solutions can help you work around the limitations while maintaining the integrity of your application."
