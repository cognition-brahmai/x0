        "content": "Is there a method in Keras that functions similarly to sklearn's `train_test_split()` method? In sklearn, `train_test_split()` works as follows: `X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size = 0.3, stratify = Y)`. This method splits the data into a 70:30 ratio and attempts to balance the labels in both datasets. Does Keras have an equivalent function?"

        "content": "Keras itself does not have a direct equivalent of the `train_test_split()` function from scikit-learn. However, you can easily use the `train_test_split()` function from scikit-learn to split your data before feeding it into a Keras model. This is a common practice when working with Keras, as it provides a straightforward way to prepare your data.\n\nHere's how you can use scikit-learn's `train_test_split()` in conjunction with Keras:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\n# Assuming X and Y are your features and labels\nX_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.3, stratify=Y, random_state=42)\n\n# Now you can use X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test to train and evaluate your Keras model\n```\n\nThis approach allows you to split your dataset while ensuring that the class distribution is maintained between the training and test sets, thanks to the `stratify` parameter. Once the data is split, you can proceed to build and train your Keras model using the training set and evaluate it using the test set.\n\nIf you need additional functionality, such as splitting data into training, validation, and test sets, you can perform another split on the training data or use other tools like cross-validation from scikit-learn."
