I have also installed homebrew and hdf5 1.12.0_1 using the command `brew install hdf5`. However, when I try to install h5py using `pip3 install h5py`, I get an error indicating that the system is unable to load dependency HDF5 and that the build for h5py failed. I have verified that `libhdf5.dylib` is present in `/opt/homebrew/opt/hdf5/lib`. I tried exporting the flags `export LDFLAGS=\"-L/opt/homebrew/opt/hdf5/lib\"` and `export CPPFLAGS=\"-L/opt/homebrew/opt/hdf5/include\"` but that didn't solve the problem. How do I correctly install h5py on my system?"

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you resolve the installation issue:\n\n1. **Ensure Homebrew is Up-to-Date**:\n   Run the following commands to ensure that Homebrew and its packages are updated:\n   ```bash\n   brew update\n   brew upgrade\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify HDF5 Installation**:\n   Make sure that HDF5 is correctly installed and linked:\n   ```bash\n   brew install hdf5\n   brew link hdf5\n   ```\n\n3. **Set Environment Variables**:\n   Make sure you've set the environment variables correctly. Instead of `CPPFLAGS`, use `CFLAGS` for the include path:\n   ```bash\n   export LDFLAGS=\"-L/opt/homebrew/opt/hdf5/lib\"\n   export CFLAGS=\"-I/opt/homebrew/opt/hdf5/include\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Install h5py via pip**:\n   Use the following command to install `h5py`, ensuring to use the `--no-binary` option to force a source installation, which often resolves compatibility issues:\n   ```bash\n   HDF5_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/hdf5 pip3 install --no-binary=h5py h5py\n   ```\n\n5. **Check Python Version**:\n   Ensure that your Python version is correctly set by `pyenv` and matches the one you intend to use:\n   ```bash\n   pyenv global 3.9.1\n   python --version\n   ```\n\n6. **Verify the Installation**:\n   After installation, verify that `h5py` is correctly installed by opening a Python shell and importing `h5py`:\n   ```python\n   import h5py\n   print(h5py.__version__)\n   ```\n\n7. **Alternative Approach via Conda**:\n   If the above steps do not work, consider using `miniforge` or `miniconda`, which are optimized for Apple Silicon:\n   - Install `miniforge` or `miniconda`:\n     ```bash\n     brew install --cask miniforge\n     ```\n\n   - Create a new conda environment and install `h5py`:\n     ```bash\n     conda create -n myenv python=3.9\n     conda activate myenv\n     conda install h5py\n     ```\n\nUsing `conda` can often resolve issues due to its better handling of dependencies on different architectures.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully install `h5py` on your Mac with an M1 chip. If you encounter any errors, make sure to check the exact error messages for more specific troubleshooting."
