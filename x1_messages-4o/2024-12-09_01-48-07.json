I am using 'market' as the column I want to drop and passing '1' as a second parameter for the axis (0 for index, 1 for columns). How can I modify this line of code to avoid this warning and ensure it is compatible with future versions of pandas?"

Specifically, you need to specify the `axis` parameter using a keyword. Here's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\ndf = df.drop('market', axis=1)\n```\n\nBy using `axis=1`, you make it clear that you want to drop a column. This change will eliminate the warning and make your code more readable and compatible with future versions of pandas."
