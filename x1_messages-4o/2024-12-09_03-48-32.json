Given a sequence of \"good\" versions and one \"new\" version, I want to find the sequences which are most abnormal. I've tried an approach where I compute the mean and the standard deviation of each sequence of the good cases, and for a new version's number, I compute the probability that this number is part of this sequence. However, it's not working as expected since the numbers in my sequences are not necessarily Gaussian distributed around a mean value. I'm considering using a histogram approach, but I'm concerned about the need to store a lot of information for each sequence. I've also looked into libraries like PyBrain, but I'm unsure if this is the right approach. I'm looking for a technique, algorithm or science discipline that could help me analyze number sequences to find abnormalities, preferably while storing only small amounts of data per sequence. I'd prefer a concrete implementation in Python, but tips for other languages are also welcomed."

        "content": "To tackle your problem of identifying abnormal sequences in system version data, you can consider several approaches, particularly focusing on techniques that work well with non-Gaussian distributions and that are efficient in terms of storage and computation:\n\n1. **Anomaly Detection with Autoencoders**:\n   - Autoencoders are a type of neural network that can learn to compress and reconstruct data. By training an autoencoder on your \"good\" versions, you can measure reconstruction error for the \"new\" version. Higher errors might indicate anomalies.\n   - Libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch can help you implement this. They provide tools for building and training neural networks.\n\n2. **Isolation Forest**:\n   - This algorithm works well for anomaly detection and does not assume any distribution. It isolates anomalies by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of that feature.\n   - Scikit-learn offers an implementation of Isolation Forest, which is efficient and easy to use.\n\n3. **One-Class SVM**:\n   - The One-Class SVM algorithm is another option for detecting anomalies. It tries to separate your \"good\" data from outliers.\n   - This can also be implemented using Scikit-learn, but be aware that it might require tuning to perform well on your specific data.\n\n4. **Histogram-Based Outlier Score (HBOS)**:\n   - This method uses histograms to estimate the distribution of features. It is efficient for high-dimensional data and can handle non-Gaussian distributions well.\n   - PyOD, a Python library for anomaly detection, includes an implementation of HBOS.\n\n5. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:\n   - PCA can be used to reduce the dimensionality of your data, capturing the essence of the \"good\" versions. Anomalies may then be detected by examining their distance from the principal components.\n   - Scikit-learn provides a PCA implementation that can be utilized for this purpose.\n\n6. **K-Means Clustering**:\n   - You can cluster your \"good\" data and then determine if new data points are distant from these clusters.\n   - This approach can be implemented using Scikit-learn's KMeans module.\n\nHere's a simple example using Isolation Forest in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest\n\n# Assuming 'good_data' is a list of number sequences for good versions\n# and 'new_data' is a sequence for the new version\n\n# Flattening the sequences if they are multi-dimensional\ngood_data_flat = [item for sublist in good_data for item in sublist]\nnew_data_flat = [item for sublist in new_data for item in sublist]\n\n# Fit the model\niso_forest = IsolationForest(contamination='auto')\niso_forest.fit(good_data_flat)\n\n# Predict anomalies\nanomalies = iso_forest.predict(new_data_flat)\n\n# `anomalies` will contain 1 for normal and -1 for anomalies\nprint(anomalies)\n```\n\nEach of these methods has its own strengths and weaknesses, so you may need to experiment to find which works best for your specific data characteristics. Additionally, consider combining multiple methods or using ensemble learning for more robust anomaly detection."
