Currently, when I try to set the alpha parameter, it makes the marker edge transparent too, which is not what I want. Also, setting markerfacecolor to None has no effect on my plot. Here's the code I'm working with:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nx = np.arange(10)\ny1 = 2*x + 1\ny2 = 3*x - 5\n\nplt.plot(x,y1, 'o-', lw=6, ms=14)\nplt.plot(x,y2, 'o', ms=14, markerfacecolor=None, alpha=0.5, markeredgecolor='red', markeredgewidth=5)\n\nplt.show()\n```\nIs there a way to achieve this?"

        "content": "To achieve transparent markers with a fixed color edge in Matplotlib, you can use a combination of `markerfacecolor` and `markeredgecolor` while manually setting the face color's alpha value using RGBA. Unfortunately, the `alpha` parameter affects both the face and edge colors, so you'll need to specify the face color with an RGBA tuple to control its transparency independently.\n\nHere's how you can modify your code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nx = np.arange(10)\ny1 = 2*x + 1\ny2 = 3*x - 5\n\nplt.plot(x, y1, 'o-', lw=6, ms=14)\n# Set markerfacecolor with an RGBA value for transparency\nplt.plot(x, y2, 'o', ms=14, markerfacecolor=(0, 0, 1, 0.3), markeredgecolor='red', markeredgewidth=5)\n\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this code:\n- The `markerfacecolor` is set to `(0, 0, 1, 0.3)`, where `(0, 0, 1)` is the RGB color for blue and `0.3` is the alpha value for transparency.\n- The `markeredgecolor` is set to `'red'` to give the markers a fixed color edge.\n- `markeredgewidth` is set to 5 to make the edge more visible.\n\nThis way, you can have transparent marker faces with clearly defined colored edges."
