The script works fine on my development PC but gives a ValueError: \"can't format dates this early\" on the target machine. The error seems to be coming from the pywin32 module in my script. Here is a snippet of my code:\n\n```python\nraw = win32com.client.Dispatch(\"MyLib.MyClass\")\nacq_time = raw.GetCreationDate()\n```\nBoth machines have the same regional and date-time settings. I suspect the cause could be the C++ runtime that is being used. DependencyWalker on my development PC shows that pywin depends on `MSVCR90.DLL`. I have also noticed that the issue occurs when reading older files, not new ones and the issue does not always happen with the same file. It seems after reading a certain number of files, the issue occurs. What is causing this issue and how can I resolve it?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering with the `ValueError: \"can't format dates this early\"` is likely related to differences in the environment or dependencies on your target machine. Here are a few potential causes and solutions you can consider:\n\n1. **C++ Runtime Libraries**: You mentioned that `MSVCR90.DLL` is a dependency. Ensure that the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package is installed on the target machine, as it's required by Python 2.7 and pywin32.\n\n2. **COM Object Behavior**: The `win32com.client.Dispatch` call interacts with a COM object. It's possible the COM object behaves differently on the two machines. Check for any differences in the versions of the COM libraries or configurations on both machines.\n\n3. **Date Handling in the COM Object**: The problem might be due to how the COM object handles date values internally. If it returns a date that's out of range for Python\u2019s datetime library, this could cause the error. You might want to implement a check or a try-except block around `GetCreationDate` to handle erroneous dates.\n\n4. **Environment and Locale**: Double-check the locale and time zone settings on both machines. Even if they seem identical, subtle differences can affect date-time processing.\n\n5. **Python and Pywin32 Version**: Ensure both machines have the exact same version of Python and pywin32 installed. Even minor differences can lead to different behaviors.\n\n6. **File System or File Content**: Since the issue occurs with older files, it may be related to the metadata stored in the files. Check for any patterns in the problematic files, such as specific attributes or metadata that might trigger the issue.\n\n7. **Memory or Resource Limitations**: If the error occurs after processing a certain number of files, it might be related to resource exhaustion. Consider using resource management best practices, such as closing files and releasing COM objects properly after use.\n\nHere\u2019s a modified snippet of your code that includes error handling for the date formatting:\n\n```python\nimport win32com.client\nimport datetime\n\nraw = win32com.client.Dispatch(\"MyLib.MyClass\")\n\ntry:\n    acq_time = raw.GetCreationDate()\n    # Assuming acq_time is a string, you might need to parse it here\n    # Example: acq_time = datetime.datetime.strptime(acq_time, \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\nexcept ValueError as e:\n    print(\"Error retrieving date:\", e)\n    acq_time = None  # Handle the error gracefully\n\n# Continue processing with acq_time\n```\n\nBy adding error handling, you can at least prevent the script from crashing and potentially gather more information about the problematic dates."
