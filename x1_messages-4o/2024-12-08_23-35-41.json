One basket has all red apples, another has all green apples, and the third has a mixture of red and green apples. Unfortunately, all of the baskets are mislabeled. Using only one apple from one basket, how can I correctly label each basket? Can you provide me with Swift code to accomplish this task?"

        "content": "To solve this problem, we need to apply logical reasoning rather than writing actual Swift code, as it involves a real-world scenario rather than a computational one. However, I can guide you through the logical steps of the solution and then show you how you might simulate this process in Swift.\n\n### Logical Solution:\n\n1. **Pick an Apple from the Basket Labeled \"Mixed\":**\n   Since all baskets are mislabeled, the basket labeled as \"Mixed\" cannot actually be mixed. It must either be all red or all green. \n\n2. **Determine the Correct Label:**\n   - If you pick a red apple, then the basket must be the \"All Red\" basket.\n   - If you pick a green apple, then the basket must be the \"All Green\" basket.\n\n3. **Relabel the Remaining Baskets:**\n   - The basket labeled as \"All Red\" cannot be all red (since you already identified the \"All Red\" basket), so it must be the \"Mixed\" basket.\n   - The basket labeled as \"All Green\" must therefore be the opposite color to the apple you picked from the \"Mixed\" basket.\n\nHere's how you might simulate this logic in Swift:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nenum BasketLabel: String {\n    case allRed = \"All Red\"\n    case allGreen = \"All Green\"\n    case mixed = \"Mixed\"\n}\n\nenum AppleColor: String {\n    case red = \"Red\"\n    case green = \"Green\"\n}\n\nfunc correctBasketLabels() -> [BasketLabel: AppleColor] {\n    // Initial mislabeling\n    let initialLabels: [BasketLabel: [AppleColor]] = [\n        .allRed: [.green, .red],    // Actually mixed\n        .allGreen: [.red],          // Actually all red\n        .mixed: [.green]            // Actually all green\n    ]\n    \n    var correctedLabels: [BasketLabel: AppleColor] = [:]\n    \n    // Pick an apple from the basket labeled as \"Mixed\"\n    if let pickedApple = initialLabels[.mixed]?.first {\n        if pickedApple == .red {\n            correctedLabels[.mixed] = .red\n            correctedLabels[.allGreen] = .green\n            correctedLabels[.allRed] = .green\n        } else {\n            correctedLabels[.mixed] = .green\n            correctedLabels[.allGreen] = .red\n            correctedLabels[.allRed] = .red\n        }\n    }\n    \n    return correctedLabels\n}\n\nlet result = correctBasketLabels()\nfor (label, color) in result {\n    print(\"\\(label.rawValue) basket is actually: \\(color.rawValue)\")\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Swift Code:\n\n- We define enums for `BasketLabel` and `AppleColor` to represent the possible states.\n- We simulate the initial mislabeling with a dictionary.\n- We pick an apple from the basket labeled \"Mixed\" to determine its actual contents.\n- Based on the color of the apple picked, we deduce the correct labels for the other baskets.\n- Finally, the corrected basket labels are printed.\n\nThis code simulates the logical steps needed to solve the problem and demonstrates how you might implement a solution in Swift."
