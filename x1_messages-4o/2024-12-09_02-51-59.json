        "content": "Yes, you can reverse the order of the y-axis in a Seaborn heatmap by modifying the y-axis ticks. This can be done using Matplotlib's `invert_yaxis()` function. Here's how you can achieve that:\n\n```python\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Sample data\ndata = np.random.rand(10, 10)  # 10x10 matrix\n\n# Create a heatmap\nsns.heatmap(data)\n\n# Invert the y-axis\nplt.gca().invert_yaxis()\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nIn this code, `sns.heatmap(data)` creates the heatmap, and `plt.gca().invert_yaxis()` is used to reverse the order of the y-axis, so it starts with 0 at the bottom and ends with 9 at the top. Adjust the data and labels as per your requirements."
