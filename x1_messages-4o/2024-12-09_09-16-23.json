Here's a simple Swift script that determines whether a given integer is even or odd:\n\n```swift\nimport Foundation\n\nfunc checkEvenOrOdd(number: Int) {\n    if number % 2 == 0 {\n        print(\"\\(number) is even.\")\n    } else {\n        print(\"\\(number) is odd.\")\n    }\n}\n\n// Example usage\nlet inputNumber = 7\ncheckEvenOrOdd(number: inputNumber)\n```\n\nIn this script, the function `checkEvenOrOdd` takes an integer as input and checks the remainder when the number is divided by 2 using the modulus operator `%`. If the remainder is 0, the number is even; otherwise, it is odd. You can change the `inputNumber` variable to test with different integers."
