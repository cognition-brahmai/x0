I have attempted to create a document readme_link.rst and added the line `README <readme_link>` into the toctree of index.rst. However, my README.md is not parsed as Markdown, but just printed onto the page as text. I've also tried using m2r, but I keep getting the error `WARNING: ../README.md:48: (SEVERE/4) Title level inconsistent`. How can I resolve this issue without rewriting my README.md file as .rst?"

Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you achieve this:\n\n### Step 1: Install Necessary Extensions\n\nYou can use the `recommonmark` or `myst-parser` extension to handle Markdown files in Sphinx. Here's how you can use either:\n\n#### Using `recommonmark`:\n\n1. **Install recommonmark**:\n   ```bash\n   pip install recommonmark\n   ```\n\n2. **Modify your `conf.py`**:\n   Add `recommonmark` to your Sphinx extensions in `conf.py`:\n   ```python\n   extensions = [\n       'recommonmark',\n   ]\n   ```\n\n3. **Include your README.md**:\n   In your `readme_link.rst`, use:\n   ```rst\n   .. include:: ../README.md\n   ```\n\n#### Using `myst-parser`:\n\n1. **Install myst-parser**:\n   ```bash\n   pip install myst-parser\n   ```\n\n2. **Modify your `conf.py`**:\n   Add `myst_parser` to your Sphinx extensions:\n   ```python\n   extensions = [\n       'myst_parser',\n   ]\n   ```\n\n3. **Add README.md to your toctree**:\n   You can directly include your Markdown file in your `index.rst` by adding:\n   ```rst\n   .. toctree::\n      :maxdepth: 2\n      :caption: Contents:\n\n      README.md\n   ```\n\n### Step 2: Handle Title Level Inconsistency\n\nThe error `WARNING: ../README.md:48: (SEVERE/4) Title level inconsistent` suggests that there is an issue with the header levels in your Markdown file. Ensure that your Markdown file follows a consistent header structure. For example, make sure you are using headers in the following order:\n\n- `#` for main title\n- `##` for sections\n- `###` for subsections\n- `####` for sub-subsections\n\n### Step 3: Build Your Documentation\n\nRebuild your Sphinx documentation using the command:\n```bash\nmake html\n```\n\nThis should now parse and include your `README.md` as part of your Sphinx documentation while keeping it in Markdown format.\n\nBy following the above steps, you should be able to include and parse your `README.md` file correctly in your Sphinx documentation without needing to convert it to reStructuredText."
