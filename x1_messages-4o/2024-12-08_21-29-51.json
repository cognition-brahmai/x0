To identify if a number is prime, you can try dividing it by all numbers less than it and see if any of them divide without a remainder. If none do, it is a prime number."

        "content": "To solve this problem, we first need to determine which numbers in the sequence are prime.\n\nThe sequence is: 7, 13, 19, 25, 31.\n\nLet's check each number:\n\n1. **7**: The only divisors are 1 and 7. So, 7 is a prime number.\n2. **13**: The only divisors are 1 and 13. So, 13 is a prime number.\n3. **19**: The only divisors are 1 and 19. So, 19 is a prime number.\n4. **25**: The divisors are 1, 5, and 25. So, 25 is not a prime number.\n5. **31**: The only divisors are 1 and 31. So, 31 is a prime number.\n\nThe numbers that are not prime in this sequence are 25.\n\nThe sequence contains only one non-prime number, which is 25. Therefore, there is no pair of numbers to sum. If you intended to imply the sum by including only one non-prime number, the result is simply 25. However, as per the problem statement, it seems there should be two non-prime numbers to sum, but only one is present."
