This would involve picking 9 red marbles and 9 blue marbles. At this point, you have a total of 18 marbles, but not yet 10 of the same color.\n\nTherefore, the next marble you pick, whether it's red or blue, will give you 10 marbles of that color.\n\nThus, you need to take out a total of 19 marbles to guarantee that you have at least 10 marbles of the same color."
