However, I can't find a similar setting in PyTorch. I'm working on a classification task and I don't need a sequence to sequence model but a many to one architecture. Here's my simple bi-LSTM model. But when I observe the shapes after each layer, the output from the last LSTM returns a tensor with shape `(1, 512, 16)` instead of `(1, 16)`. How can I adjust my model so that the last LSTM returns a tensor with shape `(1, 16)` instead?\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import nn\n\nclass BiLSTMClassifier(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(BiLSTMClassifier, self).__init__()\n        self.embedding = torch.nn.Embedding(num_embeddings = 65000, embedding_dim = 64)\n        self.bilstm = torch.nn.LSTM(input_size = 64, hidden_size = 8, num_layers = 2,\n                                    batch_first = True, dropout = 0.2, bidirectional = True)\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(8*2*512, 5)\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.embedding(x)\n        print(x.shape)\n        x, _ = self.bilstm(x)\n        print(x.shape)\n        x = self.linear(x.reshape(x.shape[0], -1))\n        print(x.shape)\n\nbilstmclassifier = BiLSTMClassifier()\n\nxx = torch.tensor(X_encoded[0]).reshape(1,512)\nprint(xx.shape) \nbilstmclassifier(xx)\n```"

        "content": "In PyTorch, when you use an LSTM layer, it outputs a sequence of hidden states by default. Each hidden state corresponds to a timestep in your input sequence. For a many-to-one architecture, you typically only need the hidden state from the last timestep (or the last hidden state of the BiLSTM). To achieve this, you can simply index the last timestep of the output sequence from the LSTM.\n\nHere's how you can adjust your `BiLSTMClassifier` model to achieve the desired output shape of `(1, 16)` after the last LSTM layer:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torch import nn\n\nclass BiLSTMClassifier(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(BiLSTMClassifier, self).__init__()\n        self.embedding = torch.nn.Embedding(num_embeddings=65000, embedding_dim=64)\n        self.bilstm = torch.nn.LSTM(input_size=64, hidden_size=8, num_layers=2,\n                                    batch_first=True, dropout=0.2, bidirectional=True)\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(8 * 2, 5)  # Adjusted the input size of the Linear layer\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.embedding(x)\n        print(f\"Embedding Output Shape: {x.shape}\")\n        x, (hn, cn) = self.bilstm(x)\n        print(f\"LSTM Output Shape: {x.shape}\")\n        \n        # Use the last hidden state from both directions of the BiLSTM\n        # hn has shape (num_layers * num_directions, batch, hidden_size)\n        # We want the last layer and both directions\n        hn = hn.view(2, 2, -1, 8)  # (num_layers, num_directions, batch, hidden_size)\n        last_hidden_state = hn[-1]  # Take the last layer\n        last_hidden_state = last_hidden_state.permute(1, 0, 2).contiguous().view(x.shape[0], -1)\n        print(f\"Last Hidden State Shape: {last_hidden_state.shape}\")\n\n        x = self.linear(last_hidden_state)\n        print(f\"Final Output Shape: {x.shape}\")\n        return x\n\nbilstmclassifier = BiLSTMClassifier()\n\n# Assuming X_encoded is your pre-processed input data\nxx = torch.tensor(X_encoded[0]).reshape(1, 512)\nprint(f\"Input Shape: {xx.shape}\")\nbilstmclassifier(xx)\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **`hn` (hidden state):** The `hn` tensor returned by the LSTM contains the hidden states for the last timestep of each layer and direction. By reshaping and reordering, we can access the last hidden state for the forward and backward directions of the last layer.\n- **Reshape and Permute:** Reshape `hn` to separate the layers and directions, then permute and flatten it to match the input size of the linear layer.\n- **Linear Layer Adjustment:** Modify the input size of the linear layer to match the resulting size of the concatenated hidden states from the last layer of the BiLSTM.\n\nThis approach should help you obtain the correct output shape for your many-to-one classification task."
