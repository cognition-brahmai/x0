There, they introduce different types of initializers, for example `model.add(Dense(64, kernel_initializer='random_normal'))`. However, it is unclear to me what the default weight initializer is when I don't specify the `kernel_initializer` argument. Is there a way to find this information or access the default weight initializer?"

        "content": "In Keras, if you don't specify a `kernel_initializer` for a `Dense` layer, it uses a default initializer. As of the latest versions, this default is the \"Glorot Uniform\" initializer, also known as Xavier Uniform initializer. This initializer is considered a good default choice for many types of neural network architectures as it helps in keeping the scale of the gradients roughly the same in all layers.\n\nYou can verify or check the default initializers by creating a simple model and inspecting its configuration. Here's a small code snippet to help you see the default initializer being used:\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense\n\n# Create a simple model\nmodel = Sequential()\nmodel.add(Dense(64, input_dim=100))  # No kernel_initializer specified\n\n# Inspect the model's configuration\nconfig = model.get_config()\ndense_layer_config = config['layers'][0]['config']\n\n# Print the kernel initializer used\nprint(dense_layer_config['kernel_initializer'])\n```\n\nThis will show the configuration details of the first `Dense` layer, including the default initializer used."
