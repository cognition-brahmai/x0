        "content": "The message you're encountering is a warning rather than an error. It indicates that the linker (`ld`) is skipping an incompatible version of the CUDA runtime library (`libcudart.so`) when trying to link your program. This typically happens when there is a mismatch between the architecture of your compiled object files and the available libraries.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check Architecture Compatibility**: Ensure that the architecture of your compiled files matches that of the CUDA libraries. For instance, if you're compiling for a 64-bit architecture, ensure that you're linking against 64-bit versions of the libraries.\n\n2. **Library Path Configuration**: Verify that the library path is properly set. You can use the `-L` flag in your `nvcc` command to specify the correct path to the compatible CUDA libraries. For example:\n   ```\n   nvcc -L/usr/local/cuda/lib64 -lcudart your_program.cu\n   ```\n\n3. **Environment Variables**: Make sure your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable includes the path to the compatible CUDA libraries. You can set it like this:\n   ```bash\n   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n   ```\n\n4. **Multiple CUDA Installations**: Ensure that there are no conflicting CUDA installations on your system. Sometimes, having multiple versions of CUDA installed can lead to conflicts. Check your paths and ensure that you are using the correct version.\n\n5. **Update or Reinstall CUDA**: If the problem persists, consider updating or reinstalling the CUDA toolkit to ensure you have the correct versions of the libraries.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to address the warning and successfully compile your .cu file."
