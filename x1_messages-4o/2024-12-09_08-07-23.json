However, I can't figure out how to explicitly input the validation set into sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV(). I have previously done K-fold cross-validation on the training set using the following code, but now I need to use the given validation set. How can I achieve this?\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn import svm, cross_validation\nfrom sklearn.grid_search import GridSearchCV\n\n# (some code left out to simplify things)\n\nskf = cross_validation.StratifiedKFold(y_train, n_folds=5, shuffle = True)\nclf = GridSearchCV(svm.SVC(tol=0.005, cache_size=6000,\n                             class_weight=penalty_weights),\n                     param_grid=tuned_parameters,\n                     n_jobs=2,\n                     pre_dispatch=\"n_jobs\",\n                     cv=skf,\n                     scoring=scorer)\nclf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n```"

        "content": "To use a specific validation set with `GridSearchCV` in scikit-learn, you can make use of the `PredefinedSplit` class. This allows you to explicitly specify which samples belong to the validation set. Here's how you can modify your existing code to use a predefined validation set:\n\n1. Combine your training and validation data into a single dataset.\n2. Create an index array that indicates whether each sample belongs to the training set or the validation set.\n3. Use `PredefinedSplit` to define the cross-validation strategy.\n\nHere's an updated version of your code:\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn import svm\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, PredefinedSplit\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Combine the training and validation data\nX_combined = np.concatenate((X_train, X_val))\ny_combined = np.concatenate((y_train, y_val))\n\n# Create an index array where -1 indicates training samples and 0 indicates validation samples\nvalidation_fold = np.array([-1] * len(X_train) + [0] * len(X_val))\n\n# Create the PredefinedSplit object\nps = PredefinedSplit(test_fold=validation_fold)\n\n# Set up the GridSearchCV with the PredefinedSplit\nclf = GridSearchCV(svm.SVC(tol=0.005, cache_size=6000,\n                             class_weight=penalty_weights),\n                     param_grid=tuned_parameters,\n                     n_jobs=2,\n                     pre_dispatch=\"n_jobs\",\n                     cv=ps,\n                     scoring=scorer)\n\n# Fit the model using combined data\nclf.fit(X_combined, y_combined)\n```\n\nThis code will use your specified validation set for tuning the hyperparameters. The `PredefinedSplit` object ensures that the cross-validation strategy respects the predefined training and validation split."
