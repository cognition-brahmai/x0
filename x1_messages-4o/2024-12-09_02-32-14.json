For instance, I have the following code:\n```python\nx = object()\ny = object()\narray = [x, y]\n# Remove x\n```\nI've tried using `array.remove()`, but it only works with a value, not a specific location in the array. How can I delete the object by addressing its position, such as `remove array[0]`?"

        "content": "To remove an object from a list in Python by its position, you can use the `del` statement or the `pop()` method. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Using `del`:**\n\n   ```python\n   x = object()\n   y = object()\n   array = [x, y]\n\n   # Remove the object at index 0\n   del array[0]\n   ```\n\n   After executing this code, `array` will only contain the object `y`.\n\n2. **Using `pop()`:**\n\n   ```python\n   x = object()\n   y = object()\n   array = [x, y]\n\n   # Remove the object at index 0 and return it\n   removed_object = array.pop(0)\n   ```\n\n   The `pop()` method not only removes the object at the specified index but also returns it. After this operation, `array` will again only contain the object `y`, and `removed_object` will hold the reference to the object `x`.\n\nBoth methods effectively remove the object at the specified index from the list. Use `del` if you don't need to use the removed object afterward, and use `pop()` if you need to retain a reference to it."
