        "content": "I'm trying to use pytorch for implementing Kmeans using gradient descent on centroid locations instead of using the expectation-maximisation method. The loss is calculated as the sum of square distances of each point to its nearest centroid, and I use argmin to identify which centroid is nearest to each point. However, I'm aware that argmin is not differentiable everywhere. Despite this, pytorch still seems to be able to perform backpropagation and update weights (centroid locations), giving similar performance to sklearn kmeans on the data. I'm confused as to how this is possible since argmax is not differentiable, as stated in a Pytorch Github discussion (https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/1339). Can you explain how Pytorch is managing to backpropagate through argmax or argmin, or suggest a way to figure this out within Pytorch?"

        "content": "In your implementation of K-means using PyTorch, you are correct that the `argmin` operation is not differentiable. However, PyTorch is likely able to backpropagate and update the centroid locations due to how you have structured your code. Here are a few insights into how this might be happening:\n\n1. **Gradient Flow**: When using operations like `argmin` or `argmax`, the gradients can indeed become undefined at points where the function is not differentiable. However, the overall loss function you have defined (sum of squared distances) is differentiable with respect to the centroid locations, assuming you don't directly use the non-differentiable operations in the computation of gradients.\n\n2. **Disconnected Gradients**: If the `argmin` is used only to determine the nearest centroid and not directly involved in the gradient computation, PyTorch can still compute gradients for other parts of the model. In this case, the centroid assignments might act as a discrete selection mechanism, but the actual gradient updates happen in the differentiable parts of your loss computation.\n\n3. **Custom Gradient Handling**: It is possible that in your implementation, you are not directly using the gradients from the `argmin` operation, but rather focusing on the gradient flow from the computed loss back to the centroids. As long as the loss is differentiable with respect to the centroids, PyTorch can update them properly.\n\n4. **Approximation or Surrogate Gradients**: In some implementations, non-differentiable operations are approximated with surrogate gradients which allows for effective backpropagation. Although it doesn't seem like you've explicitly implemented this, it's worth considering if there's any part of your code that might be implicitly allowing this.\n\n5. **Implementation Details**: PyTorch might have optimizations or specific handling for such cases that allow the training loop to propagate useful gradients despite the presence of non-differentiable operations.\n\nTo gain further insights, consider the following steps:\n\n- **Check Gradient Flow**: Use PyTorch's `autograd` functionalities like `torch.autograd.grad` or `torch.autograd.Function` to inspect where gradients are being calculated and ensure that they are not being blocked by non-differentiable operations.\n\n- **Debugging Tools**: Use tools like PyTorch's hooks (`register_hook`) to monitor the gradients at different points in your model. This can help you verify which parts of your network are contributing to the gradient updates.\n\n- **Visualization**: Plot or log the gradients of the centroid locations over time to see if they are being updated as expected.\n\nBy understanding these aspects of your implementation, you should be able to clarify why the backpropagation is still functioning effectively despite using `argmin`."
