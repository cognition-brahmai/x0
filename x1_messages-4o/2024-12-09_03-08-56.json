I know I can do this with `users_query.count()`, but how can I do the same using `exists`?"

The `exists()` function is often more efficient than counting rows, especially when you don't need the exact number of rows, just a boolean indicating the presence of any matching rows.\n\nHere's how you can use `exists()` to check if there are any users with a specific email:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import exists\n\n# Create an 'exists' query\nuser_exists = db.session.query(exists().where(User.email == 'x@x.com')).scalar()\n\n# 'user_exists' will be True if a user with that email exists, otherwise False\nif user_exists:\n    print(\"User exists\")\nelse:\n    print(\"User does not exist\")\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n1. `db.session.query(exists().where(User.email == 'x@x.com'))` creates a query that checks for the existence of any row in the `User` table with the specified email.\n2. `scalar()` is used to get a single boolean value from the query. It returns `True` if a matching row exists, otherwise `False`.\n\nThis method is efficient because it stops processing as soon as it finds a single matching row, rather than counting all matches."
