Why am I allowed to create multiple cursors on a connection, if I am only allowed to use one at a time, and the same one can always be reused? Moreover, if I want to run a query for each row of the results of another query, like this:\n\n```python\nfor x in c1.execute(...):\n    for y in c2.execute(...):\n```\n\nDo I have to create multiple connections to the same database?"

        "content": "The issue you're encountering is related to how the Microsoft SQL Server ODBC driver handles multiple active statements on a single connection. The error message \"Connection is busy with results for another hstmt\" indicates that the driver does not support multiple active result sets (MARS) by default. This is why you can create multiple cursors, but only one can be actively fetching data or executing a statement at a time.\n\nHere are a few strategies to work around this limitation:\n\n1. **Enable Multiple Active Result Sets (MARS):**\n   If your SQL Server version supports MARS, you can enable it in your connection string. This allows multiple statements to be executed concurrently on a single connection. Modify your connection string like this:\n\n   ```python\n   connection_string = (\n       \"Driver={SQL Server};\"\n       \"Server=your_server_name;\"\n       \"Database=your_database_name;\"\n       \"UID=your_username;\"\n       \"PWD=your_password;\"\n       \"MARS_Connection=Yes;\"\n   )\n   connection = pyodbc.connect(connection_string)\n   ```\n\n   Check if your SQL Server 2005 supports MARS, as it's a feature introduced in SQL Server 2005, but it might have limitations or require specific settings.\n\n2. **Fetch All Results Before Executing Another Query:**\n   As you've noted, you can call `c1.fetchall()` or `c1.close()` before executing another query on `c2`. This ensures that there are no active results pending on the original cursor.\n\n3. **Use Multiple Connections:**\n   If enabling MARS is not an option or you encounter limitations, you can create multiple connections, each with its own cursor. This approach is more resource-intensive but allows you to run multiple queries simultaneously without interference.\n\n   ```python\n   connection1 = pyodbc.connect(your_connection_string)\n   connection2 = pyodbc.connect(your_connection_string)\n\n   c1 = connection1.cursor()\n   c2 = connection2.cursor()\n   ```\n\n4. **Iterate Efficiently:**\n   When iterating over results and needing to run additional queries per row, consider fetching all results into memory first if the data size is manageable. This way, you can close the first cursor and reuse it for the inner queries.\n\n   ```python\n   results = c1.execute(\"SELECT * FROM foo\").fetchall()\n   for x in results:\n       c2.execute(\"SELECT * FROM bar WHERE some_column = ?\", x.some_column)\n       # Process the results from c2\n   ```\n\nBy choosing the appropriate strategy based on your environment and requirements, you can work around the limitations of the ODBC driver in handling multiple cursors on a single connection."
