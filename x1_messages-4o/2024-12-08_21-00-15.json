Identify the seventh Fibonacci number that meets the specified criteria.\n5. Subtract three times this specific Fibonacci number from the doubled sum.\n\nLet's start with step 1:\nThe first five odd prime numbers are: 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.\n\nStep 2:\nSum of these prime numbers = 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 = 39\n\nStep 3:\nDouble the sum = 2 * 39 = 78\n\nStep 4:\nWe need the seventh Fibonacci number that is greater than 100 and not divisible by 2, 3, or 5. Let's list some Fibonacci numbers:\n- \\( F_1 = 1 \\)\n- \\( F_2 = 1 \\)\n- \\( F_3 = 2 \\)\n- \\( F_4 = 3 \\)\n- \\( F_5 = 5 \\)\n- \\( F_6 = 8 \\)\n- \\( F_7 = 13 \\)\n- \\( F_8 = 21 \\)\n- \\( F_9 = 34 \\)\n- \\( F_{10} = 55 \\)\n- \\( F_{11} = 89 \\)\n- \\( F_{12} = 144 \\)\n- \\( F_{13} = 233 \\)\n\nThe seventh Fibonacci number greater than 100 is 233. Checking divisibility: 233 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n\nStep 5:\nSubtract three times the specific Fibonacci number from the doubled sum:\n= 78 - 3 * 233\n= 78 - 699\n= -621\n\nThus, the result is \\(-621\\)."
