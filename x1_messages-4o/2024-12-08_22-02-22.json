        "content": "Your approach to combine two arrays in C# without duplicates using the `Union` method is correct. The `Union` method is part of LINQ (Language Integrated Query) and effectively combines two sequences and removes duplicates. Here's a brief explanation and the code snippet you provided:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Linq;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        int[] array1 = { 1, 2, 3 };\n        int[] array2 = { 3, 4, 5 };\n        \n        // Use Union to combine arrays and remove duplicates\n        int[] result = array1.Union(array2).ToArray();\n        \n        // Output the result\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Combined array without duplicates:\");\n        foreach (int num in result)\n        {\n            Console.Write(num + \" \");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Using `Union`:** This method is part of the `System.Linq` namespace and is used to produce the set union of two sequences. It combines the elements of both arrays and ensures that each element is unique in the resulting array.\n- **`ToArray` method:** This converts the result of the `Union` operation, which is an `IEnumerable<int>`, back into an array.\n\nThis code will output:\n```\nCombined array without duplicates:\n1 2 3 4 5 \n```\n\nThe `Union` method is a clean and efficient way to merge arrays while ensuring no duplicates are present in the final result."
