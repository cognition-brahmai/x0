They purchase a book, a bottle of whisky, and a box of shortbread cookies, costing \u00a310, \u00a330, and \u00a35 respectively. Write a MATLAB code to calculate the total cost of the items purchased and the average cost per item."

You can calculate the total cost and the average cost per item using MATLAB with the following code:\n\n```matlab\n% Prices of items\nprice_book = 10;     % Cost of the book in pounds\nprice_whisky = 30;   % Cost of the whisky in pounds\nprice_cookies = 5;   % Cost of the shortbread cookies in pounds\n\n% Total cost calculation\ntotal_cost = price_book + price_whisky + price_cookies;\n\n% Number of items\nnum_items = 3;\n\n% Average cost per item calculation\naverage_cost = total_cost / num_items;\n\n% Display the results\nfprintf('Total cost of the items purchased: \u00a3%.2f\\n', total_cost);\nfprintf('Average cost per item: \u00a3%.2f\\n', average_cost);\n```\n\nThis code calculates the total cost by summing up the prices of the book, whisky, and cookies. It then calculates the average cost by dividing the total cost by the number of items. Finally, it displays the results using formatted output."
