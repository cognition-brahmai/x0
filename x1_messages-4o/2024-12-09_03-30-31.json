The code I'm using is:\n\n```python\nfile1 = open('recentlyUpdated.yaml')\n```\n\nDespite confirming that 'recentlyUpdated.yaml' is the correct name of the file and even moving the file around and providing the full path to the open() function, the issue persists.

        "content": "When you encounter a `FileNotFoundError` or `IOError: Errno 2` in Python, it typically means that the program is unable to locate the file at the specified path. Here are several steps and considerations to help troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check File Path**: Double-check the file path you are providing to ensure it's correct. If you are using a relative path, make sure that the file is in the current working directory of your script, which may not necessarily be the same directory where your script is located.\n\n2. **Use Absolute Path**: If you haven't already, try using an absolute path instead of a relative path. This eliminates any ambiguity about the file's location:\n\n   ```python\n   file1 = open('/full/path/to/recentlyUpdated.yaml')\n   ```\n\n3. **Verify Current Working Directory**: Print the current working directory of your script to ensure it's what you expect:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   print(os.getcwd())\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for Typos**: Ensure there are no typos in the file name or path. File names are case-sensitive on most operating systems.\n\n5. **File Existence**: Verify that the file actually exists at the specified path. You can do this manually or by using a script:\n\n   ```python\n   import os\n   print(os.path.exists('/full/path/to/recentlyUpdated.yaml'))\n   ```\n\n6. **Permissions**: Check if you have the necessary permissions to read the file. If you're on a Unix-based system, you can use `ls -l` in the terminal to check file permissions.\n\n7. **Environment and Execution Context**: Consider if the script is being executed in a different environment or context (e.g., inside a virtual environment, a Docker container, or a different user context) which might not have access to the file path.\n\n8. **Hidden Files and Extensions**: Ensure that the file is not hidden, and double-check for any hidden extensions that might not be visible in your file explorer.\n\n9. **Symbolic Links**: If the file path includes symbolic links, ensure that they are correctly set up and pointing to the correct target files.\n\nBy systematically checking these potential issues, you should be able to identify why the file isn't being found and resolve the error."
