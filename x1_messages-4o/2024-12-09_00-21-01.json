It seems that my `asyncio.sleep()` method is not functioning as expected and I think it's not actually causing a delay. The error I am receiving is `RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'sleep' was never awaited`. How can I properly implement a delay in my requests for each URL targeted? Below is the error stack trace and the relevant code.\n\nError:\n```\nRuntimeWarning: coroutine 'sleep' was never awaited\nCoroutine created at (most recent call last)\n  File \"sephora_scraper.py\", line 71, in &lt;module&gt;\n    loop.run_until_complete(main())\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/asyncio/base_events.py\", line 571, in run_until_complete\n    self.run_forever()\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/asyncio/base_events.py\", line 539, in run_forever\n    self._run_once()\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/asyncio/base_events.py\", line 1767, in _run_once\n    handle._run()\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/asyncio/events.py\", line 88, in _run\n    self._context.run(self._callback, *self._args)\n  File \"makeup.py\", line 26, in get_html\n    asyncio.sleep(delay)\n  asyncio.sleep(delay)\nRuntimeWarning: Enable tracemalloc to get the object allocation traceback\n```\n\nCode:\n```python\nimport sys\nimport time\nimport asyncio\nimport aiohttp\n\nasync def get_html(semaphore, session, url, delay=6):\n    await semaphore.acquire()\n    async with session.get(url) as res:\n        html = await res.text()\n        asyncio.sleep(delay)\n        semaphore.release()\n        return html\n\nasync def main():\n    categories = {\n        \"makeup\": \"https://www.sephora.com/shop/\"\n    }\n    semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(value=1)\n    tasks = []\n    async with aiohttp.ClientSession(loop=loop, connector=aiohttp.TCPConnector(ssl=False)) as session:\n        for category, url in categories.items():\n                # Get HTML of all pages\n            tasks.append(get_html(semaphore, session, url))\n        res = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n    loop.run_until_complete(main())\n```"

        "content": "The `RuntimeWarning` you're encountering is due to the fact that `asyncio.sleep()` is an asynchronous function and needs to be awaited. In Python's asyncio library, many functions are coroutines that need to be awaited to be executed properly. In your code, you are calling `asyncio.sleep(delay)` without `await`, which results in the warning.\n\nHere's how you can fix your code by properly awaiting the `asyncio.sleep()` call:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport aiohttp\n\nasync def get_html(semaphore, session, url, delay=6):\n    async with semaphore:  # Use async context manager for semaphore\n        async with session.get(url) as res:\n            html = await res.text()\n            await asyncio.sleep(delay)  # Await the sleep coroutine\n            return html\n\nasync def main():\n    categories = {\n        \"makeup\": \"https://www.sephora.com/shop/\"\n    }\n    semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(value=1)\n    tasks = []\n    async with aiohttp.ClientSession(connector=aiohttp.TCPConnector(ssl=False)) as session:\n        for category, url in categories.items():\n            # Get HTML of all pages\n            tasks.append(get_html(semaphore, session, url))\n        res = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)\n        print(res)  # Print the results to verify the output\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n    loop.run_until_complete(main())\n```\n\n### Key Changes:\n1. **Await `asyncio.sleep(delay)`:** Added `await` before `asyncio.sleep(delay)` to ensure the function is awaited properly.\n\n2. **Use async context manager for semaphore:** Instead of manually acquiring and releasing the semaphore, use the `async with semaphore:` pattern, which automatically handles this for you.\n\n3. **Printing the results**: Added `print(res)` to show the HTML results fetched, which can help you verify the output.\n\nThese changes should resolve the `RuntimeWarning` and ensure that your asynchronous requests are properly controlled by the semaphore and delayed as intended."
