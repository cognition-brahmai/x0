For instance, in the second row of the output:\n\n```  \n17%|\u2588\u258b        | 134/782 [00:19<01:21,  7.98it/s, loss=0.375 ]\n```\n\nI understand that:\n\n- \"17%\" is the percentage complete,\n- \"|\u2588\u258b        |\" is the progress bar,\n- \"134/782\" is the number of items iterated over the total number of items,\n- \"7.98it/s\" are iterations per second, and\n- \"loss=0.375\" is the loss.\n\nHowever, I am struggling to understand what \"00:19<01:21\" represents? Specifically, I am unsure as to what the \"<\" sign indicates. Could you explain what this time format represents in each row?"

        "content": "Certainly! In the output from `tqdm`, the time format \"00:19<01:21\" represents two important timing metrics:\n\n1. **\"00:19\"**: This is the elapsed time, indicating how much time has passed since the start of the progress tracking. In this case, it means 19 seconds have elapsed.\n\n2. **\"<01:21\"**: This is the estimated remaining time, indicating how much time is expected to complete the remaining iterations. The \"<\" symbol separates the elapsed time from the remaining time and acts as a visual cue that these are two distinct time metrics. In this case, it suggests that approximately 1 minute and 21 seconds are estimated to complete the process.\n\nTogether, these two parts give you a sense of how long the process has been running and how long it is expected to continue based on the current speed of iteration."
