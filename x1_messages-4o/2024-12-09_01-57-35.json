        "content": "In Python, you can create a dictionary within another dictionary by using nested dictionaries. Here is the syntax for creating a nested dictionary:\n\n```python\n# Creating a nested dictionary\nouter_dict = {\n    'key1': {\n        'inner_key1': 'value1',\n        'inner_key2': 'value2'\n    },\n    'key2': {\n        'inner_key3': 'value3',\n        'inner_key4': 'value4'\n    }\n}\n\n# Accessing elements in a nested dictionary\nvalue = outer_dict['key1']['inner_key1']\nprint(value)  # Output: value1\n```\n\nIn this example, `outer_dict` is the main dictionary, and it contains two nested dictionaries as values. You can access elements in a nested dictionary by chaining keys together, as shown in the example with `outer_dict['key1']['inner_key1']`."
