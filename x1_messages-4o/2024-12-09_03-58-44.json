        "content": "To find the maximum Y value in your list of tuples and also retrieve the corresponding X value, you can utilize Python's built-in functions to efficiently accomplish this task. Here's a simple approach using the `max` function with a custom key:\n\n```python\n# Sample list of tuples\ndata = [(101, 153), (255, 827), (361, 961), ...]  # Continue with your data\n\n# Find the tuple with the maximum Y value\nmax_tuple = max(data, key=lambda pair: pair[1])\n\n# Extract the X and Y values from the tuple\nmax_x = max_tuple[0]\nmax_y = max_tuple[1]\n\nprint(f\"The maximum Y value is {max_y} and its corresponding X value is {max_x}.\")\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `max(data, key=lambda pair: pair[1])`: This line finds the tuple with the maximum Y value. The `key` parameter specifies a function to be applied to each tuple, and `lambda pair: pair[1]` specifies that the function should return the Y value for comparison.\n\n2. `max_tuple = max(data, key=lambda pair: pair[1])`: Stores the tuple with the maximum Y value.\n\n3. `max_x = max_tuple[0]` and `max_y = max_tuple[1]`: Extracts the X and Y values from the tuple.\n\nThis method is efficient and should work well even for large lists with around a million tuples."
